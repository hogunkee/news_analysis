0,FOXA,"Investors may be overlooking a big factor in who wins the takeover battle for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) — whether the Murdoch family wants to be the biggest shareholders in the new company, or would they rather cash out?The question is the proverbial elephant-in-the-room as a bidding war rages between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) for a chunk of Rupert Murdoch's Fox media empire. Fox on Wednesday accepted Disney's sweetened, $71 billion cash-and-stock bid, at $38-a-share. That countered Comcast's $65 billion all-cash bid. Experts expect Comcast to fire back soon.Murdoch, along with sons Lachlan and James — all three of them Fox board members — are legally bound recommend the best offer to shareholders. Whether Comcast or Disney prevails in the showdown over Fox likely boils down to the highest offer, tax issues and regulatory approval.But a lurking concern is whether Murdoch and family want to stay in the pantheon of the media and entertainment industry. Murdoch owns 17% of Fox's outstanding shares. The family stands to be the biggest shareholders in a combined Disney-Fox. It's possible a Murdoch one day could run Disney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Not everything in Fox goes, however. Fox retains its news channel, TV stations, sports networks and other assets and spin it into a new company, with Lachlan Murdoch as CEO.It's not clear if the Murdochs will get a Disney board seat if the Mouse prevails vs. Comcast, says Blair Levin, analyst at New Street Research. The reason: Disney owns a TV broadcaster, ABC, and the Murdochs still would have Fox.Craig Moffett, a longtime industry analyst, on Thursday published a report saying Disney holds an edge over Comcast. He says Disney's mostly stock offer provides tax advantages. He notes that Fox shareholders have a choice of taking cash or stock. And, Moffett says Disney may have a better chance of getting regulatory approval, despite AT&T's (T) recent court victory in the Time Warner acquisition.Asked about Murdoch winding up as the biggest shareholder in Disney as a factor, Moffett replied in an email: ""Yes, that too.""Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday the company has legally committed to not split Fox assets with Comcast.

5,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) won U.S. antitrust approval for its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets, raising hurdles to a potential rival bid from Comcast (CMCSA).XDisney agreed to sell Fox's regional sports networks to resolve the Justice Department's concerns that the deal would raise prices for pay-TV companies, according to court filings made Wednesday in New York.Disney rose to a session high after Bloomberg reported that the government clearance was imminent. It climbed 1% to $105.41 at 12:11 p.m. in New York. Fox gained as much as 2.5%.The approval is a victory for Disney in its battle with Comcast for one of the media industry's biggest prizes. Fox last week accepted a sweetened bid from Disney, which upped its offer following Comcast's competing $65 billion bid. The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December -- and $3 above Comcast's bid.Comcast is now mulling its next steps, including possibly teaming up with private equity investors in its pursuit of Fox assets, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal reported that if the bidding reaches a high enough level -- say, $90 billion -- the company may go to private equity firms or other backers for help.

6,FOXA,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) accepted a sweetened, roughly $71 billion bid from Walt Disney (DIS) for its entertainment assets, dealing a blow to Comcast (CMCSA) efforts to acquire the business.The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December — and $3 above Comcast's bid from last week. The new agreement also offers more flexibility and other enhancements than the Comcast offer, Fox said on Wednesday.At stake is a trove of media properties, ranging from ""The Simpsons"" to ""X-Men,"" that may help fend off the threat from Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming upstarts. Both Disney and Comcast are looking to use the Fox assets to bolster their content and expand overseas.Disney's latest offer is a ""very aggressive move"" by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and may make it difficult for Comcast to respond, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Sweeney.

That outcome is expected to spur a wave of media consolidation, emboldening companies to get more aggressive with deals.The Disney-Comcast contest will determine who controls much of Rupert Murdoch's empire, including Fox's movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc.But the two sides aren't vying for all of Fox. Part of the business will be used to create an entity called ""New Fox,"" which will include the highly lucrative Fox News, the sports channels FS1 and FS2, and the Fox broadcasting channel. That operation will be run by Lachlan Murdoch and focus on domestic television, news and sports.Disney's new offer gives Fox shareholders the option to take their payment in the form of cash or stock, up to a 50-50 level. The previous agreement was an all-stock deal, and Comcast's cash offer was seen as a significant enticement.Disney also plans to take on about $13.8 billion of Fox's net debt. That would lift the total transaction value above about $85 billion.Meanwhile, there's a separate — yet intertwined — fight for Sky, the British pay-TV company. Fox has attempted to acquire the portion of Sky that it doesn't already own, but Comcast swooped in with a higher bid.In any case, Comcast isn't likely to go away quietly.Comcast's current $65 billion cash offer for Fox — along with the potential Sky deal — was already expected to push its debt load to $170 billion, according to Moody's Investors Service. That leaves CEO Brian Roberts with some tough decisions.""The ball is now in Brian Roberts's court,"" Sweeney said.Walt Disney stock rose 1% before the open on the stock market today. 21st Century Fox, which will retain the Fox broadcasting channel, Fox News and some assets, leapt 6.5% to 47.60.

7,FOXA,"Whether or not Walt Disney's (DIS) acquisition of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets goes through, Disney CEO Bob Iger assured investors late Tuesday that the ESPN+ streaming service and the upcoming stand-alone Disney pay-TV platform would not be dependent on the deal.But without Fox, Hulu — jointly owned by Disney, Comcast (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal, Time Warner (TWX) and Fox (for now, until Disney's acquisition of its entertainment assets is complete) — will be deprived of some content as Disney looks to pump the streaming service with more original programming.Iger nodded to that goal on the call, telling analysts that ""much"" of Hulu's future original programming would come from both Disney and Fox. The merger of assets would bring Fox shows such as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Empire,"" to name a few, not to mention the entirety of FX Networks and National Geographic Channels under Disney's wing.Those remarks follow Hulu's update last week that it now has 20 million subscribers. That's still less than half of what Netflix (NFLX) claims stateside, but a formidable figure as the streaming platform stakes out its own turf in the entertainment arena and tries to build revenue streams in ways that its ad-less rival cannot.Hulu also inked a multiyear deal with DreamWorks Animation, stealing away the kids content creator from Netflix. Netflix said in December that it would release half a dozen original DreamWorks Animation Television series on the service in 2018.But Hulu's announcement last week means that it, too, will soon have DreamWorks content, and exclusive content at that. The platform and studio are teaming up to develop original kids and family series based on current DreamWorks franchises and movies, to be released in 2020.

""Raw"" and ""Smackdown"" current air on USA Network, which NBCUniversal owns.As for ""Smackdown,"" the Reporter said, World Wrestling Entertainment is courting bidders after NBCUniversal opted not to renew its deal for that program. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) has been floated as a possible buyer, the Hollywood Reporter said.WWE stock surged more than 15% to 50.28 in the stock market today, a record high. Shares in April cleared a buy point, but without strong volume. But WWE began to move out of a buy range on May 3 in a high-volume move following strong quarterly earnings. WWE stock has a 94 Composite Rating from IBD.Live sports and sports-entertainment programming still draws viewers and network dollars, and ""Smackdown"" remains popular, the Hollywood Reporter noted.

That 2.12 million figure was up 9% gain April 3, 2017, following last year's WrestleMania.Earlier this month, WWE also forecast a ""meaningful increase"" in second-quarter sales due to new content distributed internationally.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Facebook, Esports, Media Boom From Legalized Sports Betting?TV Industry Tests Limits Of Consumer Demand2 New Ideas To Play Top AI, Bitcoin And Blockchain Stocks

11,FOXA,"A Wall Street analyst pounded the table for Netflix (NFLX) stock on Friday, saying the internet television network is poised to expand its competitive moat with original content and international distribution.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target on the stock to 400 from 375.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe average Netflix user is watching the streaming service for more than 10 hours a week, which is nearly double its nearest competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu, which are closer to 5 hours a week, Ives said. That's ""an eye-popping disparity,"" he said.The company's investment in original content, with shows like ""Lost in Space"" and ""Stranger Things,"" will help it attract and retain subscribers in the U.S. and worldwide, Ives said.""Our bullish thesis on Netflix is based on our belief that the company's competitive moat, franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and original content buildout will translate into robust profitability and growth as the next phase of this story plays out over the coming year with $10 of earnings power by 2022,"" he said.The looming fight between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) over 21st Century Fox (FOXA) shows how valuable entertainment assets are today, Ives said. Netflix to date has mostly built its content library organically.The transition to 4K ultra-high-definition television also could be a business driver for Netflix, Ives said. It charges high subscription prices to access 4K content.RELATED:Netflix Subscribers Willing To Pay Higher Prices: SurveyTV Industry Tests Limits Of Consumer DemandComcast Readies Fox Bid; Investors Mull Debt, Dividend, Stock Buyback Impact

15,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA) made its $31 billion, all-cash offer for satellite TV broadcaster Sky official on Wednesday, but any notion that a bigger deal for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) is on the horizon may have been put to bed by a company executive.Judging from Comcast's stock movement Wednesday, investors seem to think comments by the cable TV giant's chief financial officer indicate that all the company wants at this point is Sky. Shares were up 4% earlier in the day and ended the regular session 2.7% higher to 34.26.The reason: While Comcast has structured the Sky bid as all cash, it would need to tap equity to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Further, it would have to outbid Walt Disney (DIS), which in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.When asked about Comcast's view of equity and debt to finance other possible acquisitions, CFO Michael Cavanagh said on the company's earnings call Wednesday: ""I don't see us using stock at these levels, period.""Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

16,FOXA,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start Here""While circumstances can always change, I think it is unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction,"" Cavanagh added later on the earnings call.Fox has made a competing bid for Sky and had been its only official suitor until Comcast confirmed it wanted the U.K.-based company on Wednesday. Comcast in February announced its intention to bid for Sky, sending shares of the cable TV firm down. Comcast has dropped nearly 15% this year.When Comcast targeted Sky, that spurred speculation that they would follow up by bidding for all of Fox, thus sparking a bidding war vs. Disney. Comcast may not be ready, at least for now, to bid for Fox using its equity at depressed levels.""People are taking that (Cavanagh's comments) to mean they won't pursue Fox any further,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""But that may not be the right reading,"" added Moffett. ""Sky makes a lot more sense with a studio acquisition than without one. Without using equity, Sky and Fox together would mean roughly $100 billion of debt. That's a staggeringly large number, so an all-cash offer is unlikely. But, mathematically, it isn't inconceivable.""An independent committee of the Sky board on Wednesday withdrew their recommendation to accept the Fox offer and terminated the cooperation agreement. Analysts expect Fox to increase its offer for Sky, possibly with Disney's help.Fox owns 39% of Sky and has offered to buy the rest of the company. A U.K. regulator in January advised that the government to block the Fox bid because of media ownership concentration. But regulators could be open to Disney or Comcast owning Sky, even though they're foreign companies.Comcast said adjusted first-quarter earnings were 62 cents a share, up 17% from a year ago, with revenue rising 11% to $22.79 billion, topping consensus estimates. Analysts expected Comcast to report earnings of 59 cents on sales of $22.74 billion for the period ended March 30.Comcast said it lost 96,000 video subscribers in the March quarter vs. 42,000 a year earlier.

17,FOXA,"A struggle for power for the No. 2 spot of a potentially combined company is muddying up merger talks between CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB), according to CNBC, citing sources.CBS COO Joe Ianniello and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish both want the job, says the outlet, which also reported sources saying that current CBS chief Les Moonves would be at the merged media company for at least two years.A special committee of five CBS board members formally submitted a below market-value bid for Viacom and called for CBS management, which would include Iannello, to lead the merged company, sources told Bloomberg.A final decision on the merger could be made as soon as this month, said the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.The outlet also said that 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, whose National Amusements controls about 80% of both CBS and Viacom, has only one vote on the board of the controlling company as his mental capacity comes under increasing scrutiny.National Amusements, which would have to sign off on any merger, reportedly has seven directors in total, including Sumner's daughter, Shari Redstone. She is said to be a driver behind current CBS-Viacom merger discussions.The elder Redstone is said to communicate via an iPad preloaded with recordings of his voice that are linked to ""yes,"" ""no"" and ""f*** you"" verbal commands, according to the Journal, citing people who have spoken with him.CBS shares finished 4.2% higher in the stock market today, while Viacom lost 3.7%.Fox News owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) has floated a possible sale of Sky News to Walt Disney (DIS) as part of a set of remedies to U.K. regulators who seek to limit Rupert Murdoch's control of media in that market.Addressing concerns surrounding the editorial independence of Sky News, Fox offered new ring-fencing policies that would establish Sky News as a distinct company within parent Sky Group, equipping it with a Sky News-managed independent board and 15 years of guaranteed funding from Fox.The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority had provisionally found in January that the Fox-Sky deal was ""not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns,"" as it would give the Murdoch family ""too much control over news providers in the U.K. across all media platforms ... and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.""As another option, Disney ""has expressed an interest in acquiring Sky News, with a view to adding it to Disney's existing portfolio of television channels, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of (21st Century Fox) proceeds,"" said Fox in a release. Disney said in December that it would acquire Fox's studio and entertainment assets for $66 billion.Fox announced back in December 2016 that it would acquire the portion of Sky it doesn't already own for 10.75 euros per share in cash. In February, Comcast (CMCSA) tossed its own bid into the ring with a $31 billion cash bid, a move that weighed on shares. Fox said then that it ""remains committed"" to its original cash offer for the company.Disney shares closed up 0.8%, while Fox shares ended flat.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Netflix Takes On Media Giants As Video Streaming War Goes GlobalComcast's Sky Bid Sends Cable-TV Firm's Stocks Down And Fox, DisneyThis Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media SectorChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityWhich Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest-Growing Companies?

The reworked bill would create the toughest rules in the U.S., state lawmakers said. California's bill prevents ISPs from exempting some services from customer data caps.

""The multiples are what they are because the businesses are very promising,"" Juenger noted.As for potential acquirers, the marriage of Disney and EA ""is almost too perfect,"" he said. ""What is Disney? 'Star Wars' and sports. What is EA?

In other M&A developments, Comcast reportedly explored an alliance with Amazon.com (AMZN) to jointly bid for Fox.An analyst at MoffettNathanson, however, says Amazon could have alternatives. Michael Nathanson in a report published on Tuesday said CBS (CBS) ""makes a logical fit"" for the e-commerce giant. He says Amazon prime, its web streaming service, will struggle vs. Netflix (NFLX) without an acquisition of a media firm.AT&T stock rose 1.7% to 32.32.19 on Thursday. AT&T closed its acquisition of Time Warner on June 15.

The media stocks have pulled back in the last few trading sessions. A bid for CBS may wait until its court battle with National Amusements, which controls former parent Viacom, is over in the fall, says Nathanson.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, in a June 21 report said that Verizon and Charter Communications (CHTR) do not need to rush into vertical mergers, such as AT&T and Time Warner. Charter, the No. 2 cable firm, and Verizon, hold strong positions in broadband and 5G wireless services, the report said.Rallies in telecom and media stocks are often driven by merger developments.

An existing offer from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) is for 10.75 pounds.""Though a deal of this size brings numerous merits, we believe it's also a slight shift in the thesis for the stock,"" said Amy Yong, a Macquarie Capital analyst in a report.

48,FOXA,"As the ""Avengers"" barrel along to the conclusion of their superfriend adventures and ""Star Wars"" mania shows signs of dulling, Walt Disney's (DIS) fresh new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Black Panther,"" is looking to reinforce its domination at the box office.X The Hollywood Reporter and USA Today each posted comprehensive roundups of early social-media takes, which lavish praise on the story, filmmaking and representation of a black superhero on the big screen.The movie, which hits theaters on Feb. 16, has enthralled reviewers like film critic ReBecca Theodore Vachon and the Los Angeles Times' Jen Yamato.BLACK PANTHER is incredible, kinetic, purposeful.

54,FOXA,"Wall Street believes AT&T's (T) chances of closing its acquisition of Time Warner (TWX) are less than a coin flip ahead of a court showdown with the Justice Department, an investment bank said Friday.X ""The market is pricing in a deal probability of 35% to 40%,"" Paul Young, a Wells Fargo risk arbitrage analyst, said in a note to clients.Recent events haven't worked in AT&T's favor. For one, AT&T was dealt a setback Feb. 20 when U.S. District Judge Richard Leon denied its request to see White House communications related to the deal. President Trump has often publicly criticized CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner. Leon said AT&T's arguments have ""fallen far short of establishing that this enforcement action was selective.""Also, the Time Warner acquisition marks the third time the telecom conglomerate has tried to push through a big deal under Chief Executive Randall Stephenson. AT&T walked away from its takeover of T-Mobile US (TMUS) in 2011 when the Justice Department signaled its opposition. AT&T's purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV sailed through in 2015, though the Justice Department derailed Comcast's (CMCSA) purchase of Time Warner Cable the same year.""AT&T's commitment to see this through seems very high,"" Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fitzsche said in a separate note to clients on Friday. ""While we appreciate history is against AT&T in this fight, based on our legal contacts' take, we still very much believe case law is on its side.""Justice officials aim to block AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, saying the merger would harm consumers.The AT&T-Justice Department trial is set to begin March 19. A federal judge is expected to issue a ruling in late April or early May. Neither the Justice Department nor AT&T have signaled any interest in settling the case with conditions placed on the merger.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersTelecom merger discussions have been put on the back burner until the outcome of the AT&T battle for Time Warner.Comcast could bid for assets of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) if AT&T wins.

55,FOXA,"The (spoiler-free) reviews are out, and people are — for the most part — raving about ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" (Which was not altogether surprising, given the near-hysterical early impressions from those who attended the Los Angeles premiere on Saturday night.)X That's no doubt good for Lucasfim parent Walt Disney (DIS), but also good for the U.S. box office, which according to Wedbush estimates is down 1% quarter to date and banking on ""Last Jedi"" to help bring comparable sales back to positive territory.So what are people saying?Earlier Tuesday, Rotten Tomatoes briefly heralded ""Last Jedi"" as the highest-rated ""Star Wars"" flick on the review site ever, with a 96% ""fresh"" rating, topping 1980's ""Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back.""But as more commentary trickles in, the eighth installment in the live-action canonical franchise (ninth if you include last year's stand-alone ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"") is now at 93%.That's back below ""Empire,"" which earned a 94% and is largely seen as A) the best ""Star Wars"" movie ever, and B) the middle-child parallel to ""Last Jedi,"" given that both are the second film in a Lucasfilm trilogy.Star Wars: #TheLastJedi is now #CertifiedFresh at 93% on the #Tomatometer, brought to you by @Verizon! https://t.co/AYXN4dyGMb pic.twitter.com/cliNcBTwmh— Rotten Tomatoes (@RottenTomatoes) December 12, 2017GQ says ""Last Jedi"" is ""even better"" than 2015's ""The Force Awakens,"" its predecessor, story wise. Rolling Stone describes the film as ""bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning."" And the Los Angeles Times says the latest in the series is ""easily its most exciting iteration in decades.""""Last Jedi"" also apparently features an excellent lightsaber fight, one to rival all lightsaber fights. Variety calls it ""hall-of-fame-worthy,"" while the Washington Post says it is ""arguably the most exciting lightsaber fight in the entire franchise, a scene that is even more striking for the way it emerges from a moment of genuine ambiguity and refuses to resolve in a way that would provide easy satisfaction.""Still, with expectations so high, the movie can't help but let down some viewers, however, as it did Variety's Peter Debruge.""As it turns out, although ""The Last Jedi"" meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson's effort is ultimately a disappointment,"" he wrote, giving it good marks for entertainment but a lukewarm reception for its ability to push the overall storyline forward.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Either way, ""Last Jedi,"" which hits theaters Thursday evening, should fare well at the box office this weekend — the question is how well. Per estimates, probably not well enough to outperform ""The Force Awakens,"" which according to Box Office Mojo data holds the record for best opening weekend ever, reeling in just shy of $248 million.Deadline says industry analysts are looking at a $200 million domestic opening for ""Last Jedi"" — which would make it No. 4, behind ""Jurassic World"" and ""The Avengers"" in the U.S. — and internationally, between $424 million to $440 million.On Wall Street, however, the main figures at the top of investors' minds will be just how much Disney is shelling out for 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets. CNBC reported Tuesday that a Disney-Fox deal, valued at around $60 billion, is expected to be announced on Thursday.RELATED:Some Mutual Funds Get A Boost From Value Stock TiltDisney-Fox Combination Would Create Formidable Rival For NetflixDisney-Fox Deal Means CEO Iger Will Likely Push Back Retirement ...

Viacom shares settled 9.6% higher at 33.76, with most of those gains coming just before the close. Viacom retreated 2% late.Shari Redstone, vice chair of the board at CBS and non-executive vice chair of the board at Viacom, was reportedly looking to reunite the two media giants, according to an initial report from entertainment outlet TheWrap, citing multiple inside sources.But soon after, CNBC  that said the two media companies are not in active merger talks, citing multiple reports.UPDATE: Viacom & CBS are not in active merger talks, 2 reports say. $VIAb shares now down 2% after hours following spike into the close on initial report. https://t.co/G1aKzuHiHQ pic.twitter.com/tDhd0zShfU— CNBC (@CNBC) January 12, 2018This would not have been the first time a Redstone has pushed for a CBS-Viacom merger since they split over a decade ago. In 2016, Sumner Redstone's National Amusements — of which daughter Shari is president — sent Viacom a letter asking for an all-stock merger with CBS. (National Amusements controls around 80% of both Viacom and CBS voting shares.)But Viacom shut down talks later that year, after the younger Redstone pulled the plug on the proposal, supporting then-new Viacom chief Bob Bakish and telling Recode last year that there was better value in CBS and Viacom remaining separate.But that was before Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to acquire 21st Century Fox (FOXA) entertainment assets. TheWrap said Redstone believes the companies need to have a bigger footprint to succeed.Viacom owns Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and more, with teen and children's programming heavily exposed to Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming options. CBS is the most-watched broadcast network by catering to an older audience that is most likely to watch traditional TV as opposed to Netflix or mobile viewing.A key person in any move to merge is CBS head Les Moonves, who in the past has been reluctant to combine the network with another entertainment entity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The 5 Biggest Ways The Disney-Fox Merger Could Affect YouThis Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media SectorDisney-Fox Deal Negative For Netflix, Positive For Roku: Analyst

58,FOXA,"More viewers are interested in watching other people play video games competitively on Twitch than are tuning in to the talking heads at cable news network CNN.That's according to Macquarie Research, which has been tracking esports viewership on Twitch.TV for over a year. Twitch is owned by e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).In January, Twitch attracted a record 962,000 average concurrent viewers, up 22% from the same month a year earlier and up 26% from December, Macquarie analyst Benjamin Schachter said in a report Tuesday.For comparison, total day viewership for Time Warner (TWX)-owned CNN was 783,000 last year. Comcast (CMCSA)-owned MSNBC averaged 885,000 during the period and 21st Century Fox (FOXA)-owned Fox News Channel and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ESPN each had about 1.5 million viewers.Twitch ranks ""squarely among the most-watched U.S. cable channels,"" Schachter said. And esports viewership continues to grow rapidly.Esports viewership patterns are in flux, he said. Less than half of the games ranked in the top 10 weekly rankings in January 2017 ranked in the top 10 from this past January, Schachter said. Most notably battle royale games ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" and ""Fortnite"" have surged in popularity in the past year.

59,FOXA,"Telecom mergers may be on the back-burner as regulators vow to block the nuptials of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), but talk during recent industry earnings calls are leading Wall Street analysts to believe there still are possible combinations to be had out there.X The prevailing view is that deals are on hold until AT&T either wins or loses in its battle with the Department of Justice, which is seeking to thwart the telecom giant's purchase of Time Warner. A trial is slated to start March 19, with a federal judge expected to rule on the case by late April or May.Referring to AT&T-DOJ court battle, T-Mobile US (TMUS) Chief Executive John Legere, on his company's earnings call Feb. 9, said there's ""a huge pent-up bubble of logical things that need to happen"" in the telecom industry.One wild card in merger speculation is an agreement forged by Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) in May 2017. The two cable TV firms agreed not to make a wireless acquisition for a year unless they obtained each other's approval. That pact expires in the spring.T-Mobile's Legere told analysts that cable TV firms are likely to be involved in a wireless merger at some stage.""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,"" he said. T-Mobile and Sprint (S) shelved their merger talks in early November.Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, continue to speculate over potential merger partners.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar says cable TV firm Charter could target Altice USA (ATUS). Both Charter and Altice operate in the New York City area, he noted in a report. Altice could be a seller rather than a buyer as its Europe-based parent company restructures, analysts say.Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet on Feb. 7 upgraded Dish Network (DISH) to buy on views that the satellite broadcaster could be purchased, though no deal seems imminent.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Verizon Communications (VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam, on its January earnings call, said ""there is nothing going on right now"" in terms of acquiring a media or other company. Verizon has been viewed as a buyer of Dish or CBS.CBS and Viacom (VIA), meanwhile, have confirmed talks over a possible recombination after splitting up in 2006.While reports resurfaced on Monday that Comcast could rebid for assets of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), the cable TV firm is likely to wait until the outcome of the AT&T-DOJ battle, analysts say. Walt Disney (DIS) in December agreed to buy Fox's film, television and international businesses.If the DOJ successfully blocks AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, that would make other telecom-media mergers less likely, analysts say. In that case, Comcast and Charter could try to merge to gain scale vs. a combined Disney/Fox.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

60,FOXA,"E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) looked like an underdog as bidding kicked off on Friday for England's Premier League soccer TV rights, with incumbents Sky and BT Group (BT) the favorites.If Amazon bids, it may target one of two smaller packages rather than the five biggest ones available, one report said. In all, 200 broadcast rights for 200 live games are up for grabs. Rupert Murdoch's Sky and BT, formerly British Telecom, paid $7.1 billion for rights in 2015.X U.K. media reports said Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) appeared to be on the sidelines when the Premier League auction began Friday.Facebook and Discovery (DISCA)-owned Eurosport, though, announced Friday that live and taped content from the ongoing Winter Olympics in South Korea will be streamed at the social media website in several European countries.The Premier League auction most likely will end early next week, with pay-TV firms Sky and BT expected to win the lion's share of broadcast rights to soccer games.The Premier League auction has been viewed as a test for Amazon's appetite for digital sports rights. Amazon paid $50 million to the National Football League for digital streaming rights to Thursday night games for the 2017 season. Amazon replaced Twitter (TWTR), which streamed Thursday night football games in 2016 and paid only $10 million.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Now, the digital streaming rights for Thursday night football games are being re-auctioned.The NFL in January awarded Murdoch's 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) a five-year deal for broadcast rights to Thursday night games.

62,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) are nearing a deal that would put a price tag of up to $29 a share for Fox's movie and TV studio, plus certain international and cable assets, sources told the Wall Street Journal.X The deal would value all of Fox at more than $40 a share, the Journal added. An agreement is expected on Thursday, CNBC reported earlier this week.Disney shares rose 0.4% after hours to 108.00 on the stock market today. Fox rose 1.7% late to 33.30, after closing down 4%.The news comes after Comcast abandoned its bid late Monday. Fox's cable and international assets in question are reportedly FX, National Geographic, its stake in Hulu, Star's India TV and a 39% stake in U.K.-based Sky.According to CNBC, Fox shareholders would be entitled to one share of what remains of the company after the sale — which the business network's sources say would be worth $10 a share — in addition to Disney shares in a fixed exchange ratio.And sources told Bloomberg Monday that under the terms of a deal, a small stake in Disney would wind up in the hands of a trust belonging to Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his family.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Should a deal come Thursday, also look for announcements regarding the tenure of Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, who is currently on track to retire in 2019.But reports point to a possible two- to three-year extension of his contract, pushing back his retirement date, to see through the integration of Fox and Disney assets.RELATED:FANG Stocks News & Quotes News And Analysis Of Dow Jones Industrial Average And Component StocksStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Disney would acquire Fox's movie and TV studio, networks including FX and National Geographic, and international assets including Star India's TV channels and a 39% stake in European satellite provider Sky.

Fox Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch is likely to be offered a senior position at Disney after the transaction closes, the person said. That would put him in the running as a candidate to eventually succeed Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger.The talks between Disney and Fox, which began more than two months ago, will unite two giants of the entertainment industry and mark a significant turning point for Rupert Murdoch, the mogul who has spent the past seven decades assembling a media empire.

The transaction includes the 20th Century Fox movie and TV studios, FX Networks, National Geographic, Fox's regional sports networks, Fox Networks Group International and Star India, as well as Fox's stakes in Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.Disney says the acquisition will help it ramp up its direct-to-consumer streaming services. Disney plans to launch an ESPN sports streaming service in 2018, a Disney-branded family-friendly streaming service in 2019, and use Hulu as a more adult-oriented streaming service. The Fox deal will increase Disney's ownership stake in Hulu to 60% from 30%. Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal owns 30% of Hulu and Time Warner (TWX) has a 10% stake in the streaming service.Before Disney acquires the Fox entertainment assets, 21st Century Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company that will be spun off to its shareholders.RELATED:This Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media SectorDisney-Fox Combination Would Create Formidable Rival For Netflix

69,FOXA,"Hollywood will never be the same after Thursday's mega-deal that gives Walt Disney (DIS) all of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) movie and TV operations, FX and National Geographic, regional sports properties, Fox's Hulu stake and international TV businesses.X The ink's still drying (and regulators will surely be examining the deal closely), but if it happens, here's what this could mean for you.In 2016, Disney's Buena Vista studio rang up the most box office monies with 26.3% domestic market share and just over $3 billion in gross ticket receipts. Twentieth Century Fox came in third with 12.9% and $1.47 billion, according to Box Office Mojo data.Together, they accounted for nearly 40% of the box office. A combined Buena Vista-20th Century Fox studio system would cement Disney's place at the No. 1 spot, making it a movie monster. No. 2 player Warner Bros. and its 16.7% share ($1.9 billion) last year would have a hard time catching up.(If you're curious, Universal and Sony/Columbia round out the top 5 players in American theaters.)All of this means that once the transaction closes, likely mid-next year, Disney might prove to be unavoidable at your local movie theater.The X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool are back in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now — heck, even Spidey's been on loan from Sony — which means that all of your favorite Marvel heroes have a greater chance of getting screen time together than ever before.Disney CEO Bob Iger, on a conference call Thursday, said he is ""looking forward"" to expanding the MCU to include these guys.Iron Man could hang out with Mister Fantastic! Thor could trade hair secrets with Rogue! Hulk could share anger management tools with Wolverine!Think about it. The possibilities are endless.Furthermore — listen close, ""Star Wars"" nerds — Iger is also eager to reunite the original Lucasfilm flick, 1977's ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" with its successors.This ""opens new opportunities for that iconic franchise,"" he said.Mashable hopes that means a ""proper restoration and re-release of Star Wars as it was seen in 1977, without the controversial retrofitting Lucas added in the 1997 Special Edition.""So hey, maybe Disney's new standalone streaming service could include all the ""Star Wars"" flicks your heart desires, including a high-def visual of Han shooting first.TV enthusiasts: If you've been mulling over whether it's worth it to tack on a Hulu subscription to your Netflix and Amazon memberships, consider that more movies and shows are coming down the pipe.Iger said he envisions Hulu being ""sort of a more adult-oriented product using Fox Television production and FX.""Fox pulling out of Hulu means that Disney has doubled its stake in the streaming entertainment platform from 30% to 60%, giving it a controlling interest in the company that is also jointly owned by Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal (30%) and Time Warner (10%).""Owning roughly a third of it was great, but having control of it will enable us to greatly accelerate Hulu into that (direct-to-consumer streaming) space and become an even more viable competitor to those that are already out there,"" said Iger, in a nod to Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.Basically, he plans to do that by ""flowing more content in Hulu's direction."" The service has noticeably lagged behind Netflix and Amazon in the original content space, pretty much all the way up until ""The Handmaid's Tale"" charged into the critics' circle earlier this spring.Iger also alluded to the Hulu's too-many-cooks problem that has plagued the company as a result of being partially owned by nearly every media giant in Hollywood.""Managing Hulu becomes just a little bit more clear, a little bit more efficient, a little bit more effective, with a controlling shareholder rather than with equal partners,"" he said.Disney is adding 22 regional sports networks (RSNs) to its stable — i.e. channels that carry games from 44 professional NBA, MLB and NHL teams.So if you heard about Disney's plans for a standalone ESPN streaming service, ESPN Plus, and thought, ""Nah, thanks,"" you might someday re-consider.While Iger doesn't see much of a place for RSNs in ESPN's direct-to-consumer platform in the short term, given that their distribution is already tied up under existing contracts, he appears ready to jump at the chance to add local games to ESPN's streaming offering when they become available.""If, as I mentioned earlier, there is an opportunity to bring their product more in the direct-to-consumer vein or the direct-to-consumer business, we'll take full advantage of that,"" he said.And ESPN's brand is going international.""Regional Sports Networks here in the United States, as well as a rich portfolio of sports rights and properties in Europe, India and Latin America, nicely complements ESPN's existing business and creates exciting new avenues to grow this brand far beyond the United States,"" said Iger on Thursday.Shares of Disney closed 0.6% higher at 111.27 on the stock market today after gaining 2.75% Thursday. Fox dipped 0.1%, after jumping 6.5% the day before. Netflix added 0.3%, and Amazon rose 0.4%.RELATED:Disney-Fox Deal Negative For Netflix, Positive For Roku: Analyst

While CBS chief Les Moonves has not been keen on the possibility of a CBS-Viacom reunion in recent years, Bloomberg is reporting that he is now open to the idea.The recent, swift changes to the media landscape may be changing minds at the studio level, as digital players such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon plow deeper into Hollywood, and Walt Disney (DIS) takes possession of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) TV and film assets.Lionsgate's class A shares shot up 6.9% to 34.50 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level in more than two years.

76,FOXA,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger stressed Thursday that in addition to beefing up an already-vast library of TV and movies, the $66 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets provides the opportunity to expand globally and ramp up its direct-to-consumer streaming.X The deal includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, FX Networks, National Geographic, Fox's regional sports networks, Fox Networks Group International and Star India, as well as Fox's stakes in Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.It comes as Disney plans to launch an ESPN streaming service in 2018, a Disney-branded family-friendly streaming service in 2019, and use Hulu as a more adult-oriented streaming service.""One of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, enabling us to better serve consumers around the world,"" said Iger, who will be extending his contract from 2019 through 2021 as part of the agreement, on a Thursday conference call. ""As I've said before, we believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it's our highest priority.""The cord-cutting trend, i.e. people shedding their cable subscriptions, has broadly pushed media companies to offset cable subscriber losses with more streaming options. The Disney-branded streaming service will already have original content in the form of the powerful ""Star Wars"" brand, as well as Pixar and Disney Animation movies, positioning the platform as a formidable competitor to Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).Now, Fox movies like ""Fantastic Four,"" ""Deadpool,"" and the ""X-Men"" series will round out Disney's Marvel properties, with major franchises such as ""Aliens"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" further padding out a rich trove of content.Disney will pay $52.4 billion in stock and assume $13.7 billion in debt under the deal, which works out to 0.2745 share for each Fox share, equal to $29.54 as of Disney's Wednesday close. The transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2018, and is seen providing at least $2 billion in cost synergies.If the transaction doesn't go through, Disney is on the hook for a $2.5 billion breakup fee.Shares of Disney were up 2.75% at 110.57 on the stock market today, after weeks of speculation that a deal was imminent. Fox surged 6.5% to 34.88. Comcast (CMCSA), which abandoned its own bid for Fox earlier this week, rose 1.4%, Viacom (VIAB) gained 0.6%, CBS (CBS) rallied 1.7%.Time Warner (TWX), which has a deal to be bought by AT&T (T), was off 0.4%. Netflix rose 0.9% and Amazon picked up 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Iger told ABC's  ""Good Morning America"" Thursday that he doesn't expect to reach the ""scale of Netflix quickly,"" but sees being a top competitor.Some analysts are already bullish on the prospects, though.""We view this as a 'home run deal' for Disney and while it's an aggressive acquisition with a high price tag, in our opinion this is the right move at the right time as the marriage of these assets creates a much more formidable Disney on both the content and streaming front for the coming years with its primary goal to invade Netflix's 'golden streaming sandbox' when it launches its competitive service in 2019,"" wrote GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives on Thursday.The deal also brings Disney's stake in Hulu to 60%, up from 30%. Comcast's NBCUniversal owns another 30% and Time Warner has a 10% stake in the streaming platform. Having a controlling interest in Hulu will help make management of the company more clear and efficient, said Iger on the call.By supersizing its library of intellectual property and annexing more of Hulu, Disney may be able to more easily brush off concerns surrounding subscriber losses at its media networks unit, in particular at premium sports cable network ESPN, which relies on being part of the traditional cable bundle.Iger is a firm believer in ESPN's power as a sports media brand. Now he is pointing to plans to take it international.""The addition of Fox's global sports platforms, which include 22 regional sports networks here in the United States, as well as a rich portfolio of sports rights and properties in Europe, India and Latin America, nicely complements ESPN's existing business and creates exciting new avenues to grow this brand far beyond the United States,"" said Iger on the call.Fox will spin off Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a separately traded firm before the Disney takeover. Disney will lease the Fox studio lot in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles for seven years, as part of the deal, reported Variety, citing an insider who attended the Fox town hall meeting Thursday.It's unclear how regulators may judge the Disney-Fox deal. Even if antitrust officials approve the merger, they could still impose significant concessions. The Justice Department recently moved to fight the AT&T-Time Warner deal in court.Another key question that remains is who might be next in line to fill the shoes of Iger after he is done seeing through the integration of Fox's assets.On ""Good Morning America,"" Iger said Fox CEO James Murdoch will assist in the transition, with the two chiefs also discussing over the coming months ""whether there is a role for him or not at our company,"" according to CNBC.RELATED:The Fox Likes The Mouse Better Than Comcast: ReportDisney's Parks Chief Emerges As Contender To Succeed IgerComcast, Verizon Reportedly Eyeing 21st Century Fox Assets'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix Subscribers

77,FOXA,"As a once-shocking idea edges toward a finish and Walt Disney (DIS) appears poised to acquire certain 21st Century Fox (FOXA) assets, CNBC is reporting Wednesday that Disney CEO Bob Iger is likely to push back his retirement yet again, and stay for two to three years after the finalization of a possible deal.X If that happens, that would mark the fourth time that Iger has extended his tenure at the House of Mouse. Most recently, in March, Disney announced that Iger had extended his contract in the top spot to July 2019, up from June 2018. He had told analysts and investors then that he would be ""open to"" prolonging his tenure if it was in the best interest of the company.One day prior, Financial Times sources said Fox CEO James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch, has been ""suggested"" during talks as a possible successor to Iger when he eventually retires.Since then-COO Tom Staggs left Disney in May of last year, the hunt has been on for someone to eventually step into Iger's high-profile role; 24-year Disney veteran and theme parks head Bob Chapek was the latest name to be bandied about as a top contender for the spot.If a Disney-Fox deal goes through, Murdoch would likely become a senior executive at Disney, said FT on Tuesday, although ""no promises have been made.""Reports of a possible transaction include the sale of Twentieth Century Fox, cable networks FX and National Geographic, plus Fox's stake in UK-based Sky and India's Star TV, to Disney. Fox would hold onto its sports, news and broadcast networks. CNBC sources put the enterprise value of those Fox assets at $60 billion.Official confirmation of a deal could be announced as soon as next week, said CNBC early Tuesday, citing sources.Indications came earlier in the week, via Bloomberg, that Fox was leaning toward Disney as a preferred buyer, given its position as a strategic fit and the possibility of less regulatory red tape.But NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have also been said to be suitors of Fox's assets. Comcast is interested in full control of pay-TV giant Sky as part of any deal for Fox's assets, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Disney fell 1.6% to 105.46 in the stock market today. Fox, meanwhile, gained 0.7% to 33.21 Wednesday after hitting a two-year intraday high Tuesday.Earlier in the week, Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers called the move ""a clear positive"" for Disney, particularly as it readies its stand-alone streaming platform that threatens to rival Netflix (NFLX).""Fox's extensive library would significantly improve the breadth of content available on Disney's direct to consumer platform, further transforming it into a must-have subscription,"" he wrote.The transaction would add to Disney's already-massive library of content, and bring ""X-Men"" back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Plus, it might nix some of the focus on Disney's plodding media networks segment, which includes ESPN.""Importantly, a deal would further diversify revenue streams away from the pay-TV ecosystem, a continued overhang on the stock,"" said Meyers.But Meyers conceded that regulatory risks might arise, as a Disney-Fox transaction ""would likely raise numerous antitrust and regulatory concerns, in our view, especially in the aftermath of the Time Warner-AT&T deal drawing greater scrutiny to Media consolidation.""The Justice Department last month objected to the planned AT&T (T) takeover of Time Warner (TWX) as anticompetitive.RELATED:The Fox Likes The Mouse Better Than Comcast: ReportDisney's Parks Chief Emerges As Contender To Succeed IgerComcast, Verizon Reportedly Eyeing 21st Century Fox Assets'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersStreaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?

Fox would keep its sports, news and broadcast networks, according to media reports.CNBC said Tuesday that a purchase agreement worth about $60 billion could be announced as soon as next week.""The acquisition of the Fox entertainment assets and a controlling stake of Hulu would make Disney a much more formidable and dangerous competitor down the road on streaming,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a report Thursday.The addition of the Fox assets would create a ""content rich competitor"" to Netflix as Disney prepares to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming video service in 2019, Ives said.""While there are clearly vast synergies around the box office/advertising by combining Fox's movie and television studio businesses with Disney's vast entertainment assets, the core underlying driver for this deal in our opinion is the impending battle royale for content and streaming services vs. the Netflix machine,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 85, meaning it has outperformed 85% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

79,FOXA,"The Department of Justice's antitrust battle with AT&T (T) likely will quash near-term megamergers involving media companies, such as 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), analysts say.XOn the other hand, if AT&T winds up acquiring Time Warner (TWX) as planned, more so-called vertical mergers involving media, telecom or internet companies might quickly follow in a new competitive landscape, they add.The Trump administration's crackdown on AT&T will make other companies leery of making media acquisitions, says Andy Hargreaves, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.""The DOJ's lawsuit significantly increases uncertainty around the application of antitrust law.

The DOJ says the megamerger would be harmful to consumers because the combined company might extract higher prices for Time Warner content from other video distributors such as Dish Network (DISH) or Charter Communications (CHTR).AT&T could also try to withhold content from emerging internet video rivals, such as Amazon.com (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL), asserts the DOJ.Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has reportedly engaged in talks with Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Amazon, and Verizon Communications (VZ), according to reports.John Hodulik, a UBS analyst says Fox is unlikely to made a deal until the AT&T case is resolved.""We expect the industry to be in a holding pattern pending final determination but continue to believe secular shifts will drive further M&A over the long-term,"" Hodulik said in his report.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion in October 2016. AT&T has raised significant debt to finance the deal, notes a Wells Fargo report. AT&T aims for an expedited trial, with a court decision in 4 to 6 months.The DOJ has asked AT&T to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T says no divestitures are required by law. The DOJ says it's not interested in placing conditions on AT&T as it did on Comcast in 2011, when the cable TV firm bought NBCUniversal. The conditions on Comcast expire in 2018.Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a report says the lawsuit's outcome will shape future M&A. If AT&T wins and no programming access conditions are placed on the deal, Moffett said: ""The only feasible alternative for distribution competitors would be to acquire their own content, either to differentiate their services from AT&T's or, alternatively, to threaten mutually assured destruction if AT&T's (Time Warner) content were to be withheld.""RELATED:AT&T Calls Out CNN Issue As DOJ Moves To Block Time Warner DealAT&T, Time Warner Deal In Distress?

80,FOXA,"November has been a month of merger talk. Chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy rival Cavium (CAVM) Monday for roughly $6 billion. Broadcom (AVGO) has tried to acquire fellow wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) for $130 billion, which would make it the largest tech takeover ever. Hasbro (HAS) has bid for rival toy maker Mattel (MAT). The media and telecom industries are basically in a speed-dating frenzy, with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) reportedly attracting many suitors for key assets.XWhy now? No one unifying catalyst appears to be behind the chatter or loosening the taps to facilitate the flow of deals. And M&A is on track to reach its lowest point in seven years.Still, while every company and industry has its own problems, cash, broadly, has not been not one of them.Companies across the S&P 500 Industrials — S&P 500 index members excluding financial, utilities and transportation companies — were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash or cash equivalents in the second quarter. That cash hoard likely hit another all-time high in the third quarter, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.""All the tools are there for M&A. The tools are there, the ability is there, the economy continues on,"" he said, adding: ""And every company has a list of other ones that they want to buy.""A mountain of cash also makes a company more attractive to investor holding groups, he said.But as GOP tax reform makes its way through Congress, nothing in the legislation pointed directly to a more M&A-friendly environment, he said. Despite the reports of corporate courtship, the numbers also don't exactly show any dramatic uptick in merger activity from years and quarters past.The tally of announced deals in the U.S. this year is on track to be at around 16,000. That would be the lowest since 2010, Richard Peterson, a principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, notes.Peterson said that buyers might be worried about stretched valuations. He added that foreign purchases of U.S. businesses have slowed, and that souring sentiment on weaker industries like retail and automobiles could be making big private-equity deals look less attractive.""With robust deal activity in recent years, buyers may be may finding it's taking longer to assimilate acquisitions into operations,"" he added.So far this year, some $1.2 trillion in deals have been announced, potentially down from around $1.65 trillion last year and nearly $2 trillion in 2015, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The total value of deals announced so far this quarter was at $287.5 billion, well below the roughly $521 billion announced during the quarter a year ago. Deals announced in the third quarter of this year amounted to $322.5 billion.And amid an economic recovery that, for many over recent years, has still like a recession, big companies have tried to snap up smaller ones because there have been fewer avenues to grow sales to Wall Street's liking.Consider the striking contrast between deals struck before the financial crisis and after. Since 2010, companies announced more than 140,000 deals, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. From 2000 to 2007, in the run-up to the financial crisis, there were around 77,000.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Some of the merger talks have also come in industries that have faced technological upheaval in recent years.Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ), have set their sights on 21st Century Fox in one way or another, while AT&T has struggled to win approval for its planned acquisition of Time Warner (TWX). The FCC has voted to ease rules surrounding media ownership, potentially making future tie-ups easier. But the cable industry is also dealing with cord-cutting. Questions remain about whether Disney can throw enough ""Star Wars"" movies and streaming content at analysts to keep them from fretting over ESPN.Meanwhile, Marvell's chip business has struggled. Apple (AAPL) may or may not keep putting Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, and the two companies have been tangled up in a patent dispute. Meanwhile, Hasbro snagged Mattel's license for Disney (DIS) toys last year, while Mattel suspended its dividend in October.At least if more companies decide to continue to get together, the cash will be there.""It all makes the stakes higher,"" Silverblatt said. ""If everybody has money, that means more people can get into the game.""Marvell jumped 6.4% in the stock market today, while Cavium leapt 10.8%.

81,FOXA,"Neither Google nor Hulu's owners have disclosed subscriber numbers for their live TV streaming services, but Morgan Stanley says their success is helping give media companies a lift amid cable TV ""cord-cutting.""XBenjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, estimates in a note to clients that Hulu Live has some 250,000 online subscribers while YouTube TV has 400,000. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google launched YouTube TV on April 5; Hulu Live started on May 3.But incumbent pay-TV companies AT&T (T) and Dish Network (DISH) have the most TV streaming subscribers and are adding to those numbers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that Dish's Sling-branded web streaming service has 1.68 million subscribers, including 240,000 added in the September quarter. AT&T's DirecTV Now service has 787,000 subscribers, including nearly 300,000 added in the third quarter.""At the margin, new virtual (streaming) adoption is a growing offset to traditional declines,"" Swinburne said in the report.AT&T has bundled its DirecTV Now streaming service with wireless products. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish also has not disclosed subscriber numbers.Cord-cutting, a term for consumers that cancel monthly pay-TV subscriptions, is still growing. LRG says the top six cable companies lost about 290,000 video subscribers in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of about 90,000 subscribers a year earlier. Satellite TV services lost 475,000 subscribers vs. a gain of about 5,000 subscribers a year earlier.That's bad news for providers of content. Media companies such as Walt Disney (DIS), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Time Warner (TWX) garner per-subscriber fees from pay-TV providers.Morgan Stanley's Swinburne, though, says media firms are getting a lift from the subscriber gains of Hulu Live, YouTube TV, Sling and DirecTV Now – even if per-subscriber revenue is lower than pay TV.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Google on Oct. 30 launched a new TV app for YouTube's streaming service, which could boost subscriber growth, analysts say.Hulu's parents are 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Disney, Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner.

82,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA) faces a tough regulatory climate if it acquires a sizable part of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), based on the trouble AT&T (T) has had in winning approval for its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition, says an analyst.Comcast owns NBCUniversal, and regulatory conditions placed on that deal expire in 2018. The Department of Justice, meanwhile, reportedly wants AT&T to divest Turner Broadcasting, including CNN, to win approval of the Time Warner deal.""It's hard to see how an attempt by Comcast to acquire more content assets wouldn't have a very tough row to hoe with the Department of Justice,"" Vijay Jayant, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients.Reports late Thursday said Comcast is in talks to buy some of the assets of Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Shares in Fox jumped 6.6% to close at 30.48 on the stock market today, while Comcast shares slipped 2.5% to 36.16.Walt Disney (DIS) also has reportedly been in talks to buy parts of Fox, including its movie and TV studio as well as some cable TV channels.Neither Disney nor Comcast can buy the Fox broadcast TV network because they already own ABC and NBC, respectively. Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004. The Mouse-Peacock rivalry has grown since Comcast bought NBCU from General Electric (GE) in 2011.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Comcast is most interested in Fox's stake in satellite TV broadcaster Sky and Star India, say some reports. But if Comcast also aims to acquire Fox's U.S. entertainment assets it could invite regulatory trouble, says Jayant.The DOJ's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said at the American Bar Association on Thursday that the agency is not interested in placing ""behavioral remedies"" on the AT&T-Time Warner deal and is seeking structural solutions to competition issues.""The AT&T and Time Warner deal is facing pushback due to concerns about vertical integration — an acquisition of material Fox assets by Comcast would face not only those concerns, but also horizontal merger concerns,"" added Jayant.Verizon Communications (VZ) has also approached Fox about some assets, but talks do not seem as serious as those involving Disney or Comcast, say reports.RELATED:Will iPhone X Promotions On Black Friday Renew Wireless Price War?Telecom Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsCable TV's Hail Mary: Hike Broadband Prices Amid Cord-Cutting

83,FOXA,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

84,FOXA,"""What great TV shows and movies are going to come out of the internet next year?"" isn't a question you might've asked even five years ago. But Hollywood's getting crowded with Silicon Valley types, and over-the-top platforms are all the rage these days, even in the critics' circle.X ""If you look at the landscape today, there's a — what I would call — a new and immense battle that is taking place in the entertainment industry, the likes of which we have never seen before,"" USC Marshall School of Business marketing professor Gene Del Vecchio told Investor's Business Daily.""It's going to be brutal, it's going to be nasty, and not everyone is going to survive.""So let's take a look at what Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and others (hi, Apple (AAPL)!) have in store for viewers and investors in 2018, as Walt Disney (DIS) prepares its own streaming arsenal for launch.Heads turned when the streaming entertainment platform said it would devote $7 billion to $8 billion to content in 2018, but it might still be shocking to hear that Netflix is going to release 80 (!) original movies in 2018. That's a 60% increase from the 50 films on its slate in 2017. (For comparison, box-office leader Disney has released eight original movies in theaters so far this year, and No. 2 Warner Bros. has released 17, according to Box Office Mojo.)A growing rival against traditional Hollywood studios, Netflix is also investing more in original kids programming and animated features, and executives have indicated that they'd like original content to make up 50% or more of Netflix's library by 2020.Previously Netflix has relied mostly on licensed content, an expensive endeavor. About $3 billion of that $7 billion-$8 billion budget will go toward originals, according to estimates from Loup Ventures, which sees Netflix's originals spending alone shooting up to $6.8 billion in 2022.Some of the shows and movies Netflix creative chief Ted Sarandos is most excited about releasing to its 109.3 million subscribers in the new year? Sci-fi TV series ""Altered Carbon"" and ""Lost in Space,"" Emma Stone comedy ""Maniac,"" and a ""Dark Crystal"" reboot, he said on UBS' annual media and communications call on Dec. 4.The strategy comes as its streaming programming costs rise relative to revenue growth, and as studios and networks look inward and try to strengthen their own streaming services. Disney notably made the choice to pull its movies off the service in 2019, choosing instead to build out its own stand-alone Disney-branded over-the-top streamer.Of course, burgeoning heavyweight Netflix is now armed with Shonda Rhimes, who until recently was a hit show creator for Disney's ABC Studios — though it's unclear when viewers can expect to put a new Shondaland production in their Netflix queues.One thing Netflix still doesn't care about, though? Live sports.""Is that the best use of the next billion dollars?"" Sarandos asked rhetorically. ""We've come to the conclusion so far to date that it isn't.""Prime Video is a player, and Prime Video is not going away.""I just want to be clear: We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018,"" said Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky on the e-commerce giant's third-quarter earnings call in October.""And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.""Estimates put Amazon's 2017 total content budget at around $4.5 billion, and that figure is likely to be higher in the new year. Loup Ventures Managing Partner and former Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster estimates that Amazon's video team spends about a third of that on originals now — and predicts that they'll drop a cool $8.3 billion on originals in 2022.Sure, online shopping and TV shows don't sound like they go hand in hand, but Amazon Studios is proving to be the piper that's leading viewers back to the virtual cash register.""Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon,"" said Amazon's Olsavsky, adding that he is ""very bullish on the video business.""The iPhone maker isn't a regular in conversations about streaming entertainment platforms, but it might be soon.In addition to talk of a billion-dollar budget for original content, Apple is reportedly beefing up the staff of WorldWide Video, its Los Angeles-based content initiative. So far the team includes former execs from Sony Pictures Television, Hulu, Amazon Studios and Legendary Entertainment, according to Variety.In the way of scripted television, the entertainment news outlet says a reboot of Steven Spielberg's ""Amazing Stories"" and a drama from Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are in the works.By Munster's estimate, the Cupertino, Calif., titan is likely to multiply next year's budget to $4.2 billion by 2022.Hulu's newly shuffled ownership makes the company's long-term strategy something of a question mark, given that Disney doubled its stake with its $66 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets.The Mouse will have a controlling interest (60%) in the platform, which ostensibly gives it the loudest voice in the room. Aside from Disney, Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal owns 30% of Hulu and Time Warner (TWX) has 10%; both are currently silent partners, but that won't be true for long.Comcast agreed to hands-off management of Hulu when it acquired NBCUniversal in 2011, but come September 2018 the media giant will be silent no more. No one is sure what will happen when Comcast gets to have a say — particularly since Disney will still be integrating the Fox team into its massive system. (The Disney-Fox deal is slated to close mid-2018.)Still, expect Hulu's path to crystallize soon enough, now that there's one fewer cook in the kitchen. In the wake of the merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger said he plans to send more content to Hulu's more than 12 million viewers and make it a ""more adult-oriented product,"" thanks to Fox Television and FX's content.That conceivably means more ""The Handsmaid's Tale""-style content to compete with Netflix and Amazon's original offerings, though Hulu's total 2017 budget of $2.5 billion was just a fraction of Netflix's. (Netflix spent about $6 billion this year overall, including licensed content.)Long known for being a service where viewers could watch the previous night's broadcast content, Hulu also has its relatively new live-TV bundle, which costs $40 a month and offers shows, news and sports from more than 50 channels.Loup Ventures' Munster remarked recently that while Amazon and Netflix are each spending twice as much as Hulu is on content, Hulu is not distributed internationally (Amazon and Netflix are), and the service is not looking to be a star in the originals space.""Hulu's approach is to offer as much quality content as possible, both originals and programming licensed from major networks,"" he wrote in late November, noting that the platform added 7,500 episodes of content in Q3.Speaking of Disney's over-the-top streamers: In the spring of 2018, ESPN Plus is supposed to get a firmer price and launch date. The stand-alone over-the-top platform stands to benefit from Fox's sports properties.If you're hoping to watch football games through the service, though, maybe dial down your expectations for now. ""Plus"" has been tapped to be a complementary service to the premium sports cable network, which means it will dig into ESPN's well of rights for games and sports that don't currently air on the flagship channel. (Notably, the streaming service will launch without the direction of John Skipper, who was until recently the head of ESPN. He stepped down last week due to substance-abuse issues.)And to quickly recap the streaming sports realm: Soon-to-be-Disney-controlled Hulu Live airs both pro and college football, as well as pro basketball, baseball games and Premier League soccer; Amazon has a deal with the NFL to exclusively air ""Thursday Night Football"" for the season; and Facebook has reportedly indicated interest in plunking down a fortune for streaming sports rights. Twitter is also expanding its live sports and news content.Separately, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu will all have to find a way to coexist with a Disney-branded stand-alone streaming service come 2019, one filled with Pixar, Marvel, and ""Star Wars"" shows and movies, on top of the already-vast library of Disney entertainment.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin In 2018: Can Futures, Mainstream Investors Tame The Hysteria?Here's Your Guide To The Stock Market In 2018Could These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?

96,FOXA,"Reports that federal regulators may file a lawsuit to block AT&T's (T) $85 billion purchase of media giant Time Warner (TWX) are likely tied to deadlocked talks over conditions — possibly involving the internet video market — that could be required for deal approval, analysts say.The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the Department of Justice could sue to block the deal. The DOJ could be trying to increase its negotiating leverage in setting conditions on the deal, says a Cowen & Co. report.""We would also observe that the last two times that DOJ actually challenged deals (AT&T/T-Mobile (TMUS), Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable), it did not let its litigation intentions be known,"" said the Cowen report.""AT&T could be pushing back hard with DOJ on the conditions,"" the Cowen report added. ""It could be that AT&T is frustrated because it hoped Makan Delrahim would arrive at DOJ and cut back or eliminate the conditions staff wants to impose.""The U.S. Senate recently confirmed President Trump's appointment of Makan Delrahim to head the DOJ's antitrust division.Experts have said, however, that DOJ officials may be looking at the video market's structure to set conditions on the deal. Regulators may be seeking deal parameters based on an economic analysis of emerging internet video services and the pay TV market.One condition for DOJ approval, for example, might be requiring AT&T to sell Time Warner content to internet video rivals, rather than keeping the content for itself. AT&T, which acquired satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV in 2015, is the biggest provider of pay TV services by number of subscribers.AT&T, in a statement, said ""vertical"" deals do not raise fundamental antitrust concerns.""For over 40 years, vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market,"" AT&T said in a news release. The company went on to say: ""While we won't comment on our discussions with DOJ, we see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception.""IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and The Big Picture (take a free trial) at the day's end for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail in October 2016 that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much ""power in the hands of too few.""

AT&T agreed to pay $107 per share, half in cash, to acquire Time Warner.Based on terms of the deal, though, Time Warner shareholders could get less than $107 per share depending on where AT&T stock is trading when the deal closes.RELATED:Could Softbank Take Sprint Private If T-Mobile Deal Is Dead?Three Reasons Why Telecom Merger Party On Hold: Goldman SachsTelecom Mergers: A 'Game Of Thrones' Without The Dragons

97,FOXA,"When Amazon.com (AMZN) began offering live Thursday Night Football streaming this fall, some wondered if it was the beginning of the end for traditional sports broadcasting.XSuddenly, the door cracked open for technology companies to buy the rights for more major sporting events. Now it seems possible that when the rights for NFL's Monday Night Football and Major League Baseball games go up for renewal in 2021-22, Amazon, Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and perhaps Apple (AAPL) could be in the mix.Don't expect a complete changing of the guard, though. Whether digital companies show up at auctions is a wild card for sports leagues as team valuations soar and player salaries continue to rise. The biggest swing factor pushing the future value of sports rights higher will be how serious new digital players are in winning deals, says BTIG Research.Further, incumbent broadcasters have good reason to bid aggressively, since live sports is one of the few tools they have left to maintain audience ratings and set high advertising prices. Some observers doubt digital platforms will gain exclusive rights to a major sports contract or championship event and push over-the-air broadcasters to the sidelines. Broadcasters offer national reach, something streaming services can't match.""People keep trying to bury broadcast,"" Les Moonves, chief executive at network icon CBS (CBS), said at a recent industry conference. ""It's still the best game in town if you want a mass audience.""To be sure, you can expect tech titans will battle the old guard of traditional media for contracts over the next decade. Moonves' CBS, Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN, AT&T (T), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC, and 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) will have to fend them off to keep streaming rights — just as live entertainment becomes vital for keeping young viewers.Already, digital companies have stepped up spending for sports streaming rights, including tennis, soccer, baseball and fringe events like surfing. Facebook recently raised eyebrows by bidding $610 million to stream cricket games in India, but lost out to a rival.In Amazon's case, it paid $50 million for the Thursday Night Football rights, five times more than Twitter (TWTR) paid a year earlier. Experts say there could be much more on the horizon for the e-commerce giant. There's speculation that Amazon may bid for U.K. Premier League soccer matches when an auction launches next year.""It could be like the Roaring Twenties from a sports rights standpoint, with a slew of competitors competing for a limited number of sports rights,"" said Lee Berke, head of consultancy LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media.Some observers, though, doubt digital platforms will gain exclusive rights to a major sports contract or championship event and push aside the likes of cable's ESPN and over-the-air broadcasters.Right now, digital companies' bidding still looks puny next to the roughly $11 billion a year that U.S. sports leagues rake in from broadcasters and ESPN.If anything, digital players are likely to ""coexist"" with the incumbents, CBS's Moonves said.The Thursday Night Football deal is an example of a peaceful coexistence for traditional and digital media, as Amazon has streaming rights and NBC and CBS share broadcast rights. Leagues could set up more deals like that, awarding broadcast and streaming rights separately.Complicating the issue is that sports salaries as well as team valuations continue to go up, partly on the expectation that revenue from broadcast and streaming rights will rise. Forbes says the Dallas Cowboys are worth $4.8 billion, up 14% from a year ago. The Houston Rockets basketball team recently sold for $2.2 billion.The average NBA salary in 2016 was $6.4 million, with the MLB average at $4.4 million and the NFL at $2.44 million, says Sporting Intelligence.""Some teams are going full blast, assuming that revenue levels will either sustain themselves or have some moderate growth going forward,"" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who specializes in the sports business.""(Leagues) could take a revenue hit,"" Zimbalist added. ""It's not going to be immediate because most deals aren't up for renewal over the next five years. So it's not going to be cataclysmic overnight.""One wrinkle is that tech companies may play a different ballgame with different goals. In Amazon's case, only members of its Prime loyalty program, which offers free deliveries and other perks, can watch the Thursday Night Football games.Amazon's streaming viewership has been higher than Twitter's for the first few games, though still a small fraction of the broadcast audience. Thursday NFL game ratings overall have dipped amid President Trump's recommendation that Americans not watch football games if players do not stand for the national anthem.But ""ratings aren't the story for Amazon,"" LHB's Berke said. ""The real story is their ability to develop additional subscribers to Amazon Prime, and the longer-term story of getting ready to bid for exclusive sports rights down the road.""Amazon has an estimated 69 million Prime members in the U.S. who pay $99 annually. If football brings in more Prime members, proves popular with existing ones and boosts Amazon advertising revenue, then the company would have more reason to spend megabucks on sports contracts.Berke adds that demographics need to change as well.Major League Baseball and tennis have the oldest average TV viewers at 57 and 61 years old, respectively. The National Basketball Association has the youngest at 42 years old, and the NFL is in the middle at 50 years old, according to a Sports Business Journal study. With digital platforms, sports leagues aim to engage millennials with social-media features that change the viewing experience.""There's a very large but shrinking pay-TV universe (and)  a small but growing OTT (internet) universe along with social media,"" Berke said.""No one wants to abandon large audiences and large (broadcast) revenue streams,"" he said. ""But more opportunities are going to digital platforms. It's a small but growing audience and it's young. Any sports property is looking for its next generation of fans.""Sports leagues fret that frozen screens could spark social-media storms. But despite video-streaming quality qualms, Smith College's Zimbalist says sports leagues will welcome internet players to the negotiating table.""Historically, they've always taken the richer offer; at one time, cable was the new (revenue) source,"" he said.If Amazon streams football games to a few million viewers without a hitch, it'll be a plus for Facebook, Google's YouTube and other digital players possibly in the hunt for big sports deals.Brian Rolapp, chief media and business officer for the NFL, says that's just the start.Rolapp recently told a conference that the technical challenges of streaming live sports with just 10 million or more concurrent viewers are formidable.For now, that rules out exclusive streaming deals for the Super Bowl, World Series or NBA championship, which can have viewership up to 10 times the viewers that streamers are capable of handling. But Monday Night Football, now shown by ESPN, has topped out at 10 or 11 million viewers, seemingly in the ballpark of what streaming services can deliver.And it may only be a matter of time before the numbers aren't so daunting for digital players. The sports industry's top spender, ESPN, has watched its pay-TV subscriber count fall. As profits dwindle, many analysts expect the cable sports behemoth to pare spending or refocus its priorities.If ESPN walks away from its Monday Night Football deal at renewal time, Amazon or another internet company could bid for rights, Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a recent report.""Will a digital company finally be willing to write a big enough check four to five years from now?"" he asked.And another question lurks: Will streaming rights necessarily go to Silicon Valley companies?CBS and ESPN, owing to its purchase of digital media firm BAM Tech, also figure in future streaming negotiations.BAM Tech's new chief executive, Michael Paull, is the former vice president of streaming video at Amazon. Founded by Major League Baseball, BAM Tech also handles back-end streaming for golf, hockey and wrestling.ESPN is readying a new stand-alone sports streaming service, due out in 2018. It will not stream the same live content it shows on pay TV. Major League Baseball says it will license some out-of-market games for ESPN's new service.Dan Rayburn, executive VP of StreamingMedia.com., adds that unlike broadcasters, internet companies do not control end-to-end delivery.""Google is not a last-mile provider. Neither is Facebook or Amazon,"" Rayburn said. ""Broadcast and streaming are very different in how they distribute content.""

98,FOXA,"Google's YouTube TV has 200,000 subscribers and could hit 2 million by the end of 2018, says one Wall Street analyst.Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital Markets says YouTube TV isn't yet profitable but that doesn't matter to Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Hargreaves says Google aims to build a brand that can take away advertising revenue from traditional TV.""The service is now rolled out to almost 50 cities, which should drive accelerating subscriber growth in the second half of 2017 and into 2018,"" he said in a note to clients.YouTube TV features live content from major broadcasters. It's priced at $35 monthly, or $40 as an app on Apple (AAPL) TV. YouTube TV's progress is being closely watched, because Google is a new entrant in video streaming. Other video streaming services are offered by incumbent pay-TV or media companies, with the exception of Sony.AT&T (T) sells DirecTV Now and Dish Network (DISH) offers Sling TV. Hulu launched a live TV service in May. Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) all have a stake in Hulu.Amazon.com (AMZN), similar to Google, is a newcomer to video streaming. Amazon Prime Video does not yet offer live TV from the big four broadcasters. Amazon Prime Video has stepped up investments in original content and is similar to Netflix (NFLX). Apple said in September that it expects to offer an Amazon Video Prime app on its TV platform later this year.Hargreaves has an overweight rating on Google stock, with a price target of 1,100. Alphabet shares ended trading Tuesday up 0.5% to 972.08.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.""We estimate content costs are $39.55 per sub, and expect operating expenses to be 17% of revenue,"" he said. ""This suggests YouTube TV will generate operating margins of minus 4%, with largely variable costs that are likely to prevent meaningful leverage in the medium term.""""Despite a likely lack of direct profits, YouTube TV provides Google with a portion of TV ad inventory on the service,"" Hargreaves went on to say.

"
99,FOXA,"Over the past six weeks, short sellers have been raising their bets that so-called ""FAANG"" stocks are due for a fall, according to a financial analytics firm.S3 Partners says growing short interest in what traditionally has been known as the FANG group — which includes four closely watched internet stocks: Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google — along with Apple (AAPL) indicates a bearish stance in those big-cap tech firms, which some collectively refer to as FAANG.""We're seeing a broad-based increase in short interest across the board,"" Brett Weiss, director of business development at S3 Partners, said Friday.Short selling involves the sale of a stock that has been borrowed by the seller. The seller believes that the stock's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back later at a lower price to make a profit.Bearish bets against the FAANGs have increased by 7.6% since mid-August, Weiss said. The total at risk in the short selling bets against those stocks is about $27.3 billion, S3 said.The largest increases in short investments have been in Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, S3 said.Short sellers have increased their positions in Netflix by $910.5 million since Aug. 15. They've upped their short positions in Facebook and Amazon by $494 million and $502 million, respectively.By contrast, they've lowered their short positions in Apple by $161.8 million over the past six weeks.Short sellers appear to be rotating out of Apple since its Sept. 12 fall product launch event, where it introduced the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series smartphones and the Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch.Apple stock has fallen about 5% since the company's new product unveiling. Investors reacted negatively to the later-than-expected launch of the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, and concerns about short supply due to manufacturing issues.Why the increased short interest in Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google lately? It could be related to negative news hammering those big names, Weiss said.""There's a lot of news on every one of these stocks,"" he said. ""The FANGs are a popular sector.""Facebook, Amazon and Google have been the subject of potential antitrust enforcement to limit their dominance in online advertising and e-commerce.Facebook also has been dragged into the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the social network ran some 3,000 politically themed advertisements that were bought by suspected Russian operatives. The disclosure could potentially lead to some government regulation on political ads and subject Facebook to more regulatory scrutiny.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.Zuckerberg, meanwhile, revealed plans around Sept. 22 that he considered creating a new class of company stock with no voting power — but abandoned the idea. He also plans to sell a big chunk of his own shares.Netflix is facing the prospect of more Hollywood studios pulling their content off the Internet TV network, following recent moves by Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Disney and Fox plan to focus on their own subscription video-on-demand services that would compete with Netflix.While Apple is down 4.6% since Aug. 15, Netflix is up 7.6% in that period. Netflix is approaching its all-time high of 191.50, reached on July 21.Netflix rose 0.4% to 181.35 on the stock market today. It has been forming a cup-with-handle base over the past 10 weeks with a buy point of 191.60.Netflix has mostly shaken off worries about losing traditional studio content because it has been aggressively ramping up production of original content, including hit shows like ""Stranger Things.""Netflix also is facing heightened competition from streaming rivals like Amazon Prime Video and Hulu.Facebook climbed 1.3% to 170.87 on Friday. That's just below its record high of 175.49, hit on July 27. Facebook stock has been forming a flat base for the past nine weeks with a buy point of 175.59.Amazon rose 0.5% to 961.35 on Friday. It has been forming a flat base over the past 10 weeks with a buy point of 1,083.41.Alphabet was up 0.9% to 973.72 on Friday. It is in a 17-week flat base with a buy point of 1,008.71.Critics of Facebook, Amazon and Google say those internet companies have become too dominant and are snuffing out competition, innovation and even freedom of expression. Pressure is mounting on U.S. regulators to scrutinize the impact those companies are having on competition, Wall Street analysts say.Amazon has been blamed for playing a big part in the ""retail apocalypse"" that has major chains shuttering stores nationwide, with some going bankrupt. On Sept. 19, toy seller Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy, with Amazon listed among the reasons for its woes.More recently Amazon has been taken aim at Grubhub (GRUB) in the online food ordering and delivery business and is rumored to be exploring an entry into the prescription drug dispensing industry.RELATED:Netflix Stock Gets Thumbs Up From Fresh Analyst ReportFacebook, Amazon, Google: Should They Now Fear Regulators?The Amazon Monopoly Problem: Prime Time For Antitrust Action Vs.

It starts Tuesday in New York.Some deals would create bigger wireless or cable TV companies while others might combine a wireless company with a cable TV firm.""As the industry landscape shifts, we believe that major operators are continually re-evaluating their strategic direction and options,"" added Feldman. 'It is not hard to understand why companies are not rushing into deals that may set their course for the next decade.""AT&T (T) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson kicks off the conference Tuesday morning. Europe-based Altice Group, possibly readying an offer for Charter, and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts also are slated for Tuesday.On Wednesday, media firms Viacom (VIA) CEO Robert Bakish and 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be on hand. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam is scheduled to appear Thursday morning.AT&T is awaiting Trump administration approval for its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), announced in October.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.""Under the Trump administration, we have seen a rapid pace of deregulation by the Federal Communications Commission,"" said Feldman. ""While this implies a potentially more favorable regulatory back drop for pursuing M&A, we have not yet seen the FCC or the Department of Justice weigh in on any major mergers under this administration.

101,FOXA,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger warned Thursday that profit will be weaker than expected this year and seemed to dash hopes that Netflix (NFLX) will retain Star Wars and Marvel content after the media conglomerate launches its own streaming service.XWhile speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, Iger put earnings per share this year ""roughly in line"" with Disney's fiscal 2016 EPS, according to CNBC.That fiscal year, which ended in September 2016, saw EPS of $5.72, and the consensus for this year has it rising to $5.87, according to Zacks Investment Research.The weaker fiscal 2017 outlook implies Q4 EPS of $1.09, well below consensus views for $1.25. Iger blamed the expected effects of Hurricane Irma in Disney's Florida resorts, higher costs for NBA broadcast rights, the investment in BAMTech, and the lack of a major Star Wars movie release (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will be released at the start of fiscal 2018).Disney shares closed down 4.4% at 97.06 on the stock market today. Viacom (VIAB) lost 3.6%, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) dropped 2.4% and CBS (CBS) fell 2.1%. Netflix edged down 0.1%. NBC Universal owner Comcast (CMCSA) sank 6% after it lowered its outlook.IBD'S TAKE: Silicon Valley and Hollywood's convergence continues, amid a growing battle to own and stream television shows and movies — and get people to pay for them in the process. Here's how the big media and tech players match up. Meanwhile, Disney's upcoming streaming app will have four to five original Disney series and three to four exclusive Disney movies, Iger said, adding that Star Wars and Marvel titles will be seen exclusively on the app.Last month, Disney announced its streaming app and said it would no longer provide content to Netflix. U.S. Netflix members will have access to Disney films on the service through the end of 2019.But just days after Disney said it would pull movie content from the streaming site, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Reuters that the company was ""still in active discussions"" to keep ""Star Wars"" and Marvel movies on the platform.Iger said on Disney's earnings call last month that it was ""possible"" that both Marvel and Lucasfilm theatrical titles will continue to be licensed to pay services such as Netflix.

107,FOXA,"A Republican-led FCC may give AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other pay TV providers more tools to counter the threat from Google TV, Hulu and other nascent internet video services, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.Ajit Pai, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Trump in January, has signaled that he'll scale back net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought more authority under utility-type regulations.Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says ""MVPDs"" a regulatory term for pay TV incumbents, could seek interconnection fees from YouTube TV or Hulu. Gallant warned that MVPDs like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon might tap other tools to counter the threat from internet video services, also called over-the-top, or OTT, services. Broadband caps on data usage are another possibility, Gallant says.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on Tuesday announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN.IBD'S TAKE: Quanta Services, Primerica and Nucor are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Google aims to set itself apart with unlimited cloud storage for users to record content. Google will seek advertising revenue from YouTube TV, say analysts, who contend that $35 monthly fees might not be enough to make the service profitable.Hulu — a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox-parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.""With the rising OTT threat and a newly Republican Washington, MVPDs may now have greater incentive and ability to employ tactics to manage the threat from OTT,"" Gallant said in a research report. ""Whether they take these steps — and whether it draws influential companies like Google, Facebook (FB), Walt Disney, Fox and others into the net neutrality debate — could be important for the longer-term balance of power within the internet ecosystem.""""We suspect the new FCC will be much more open to ISPs charging interconnection fees to high bandwidth services, mainly video providers,"" Gallant added.He says Google could respond by imposing a ""Cable Company X Tax"" on its subscribers.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. YouTube TV does not provide channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA) , AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).Alphabet stock slipped a small fraction in the stock market today to 849.08 and is about flat since the YouTube streaming announcement.RELATED:$35 DirecTV Now Live Streaming Deals Lives On After Promotion EndsAT&T Streaming Foray Hits Snag; Did Apple Avoid Black Eye?Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

One big question is how much Google-owned YouTube's advertising revenue will grow as it adds live TV and original content for paid subscription services.Google on Tuesday took the wraps off YouTube TV, which will be ""available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country,"" the company said in a blog.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling.

109,FOXA,"BAMTech is adding some serious muscle to the top of its masthead, as Amazon (AMZN) vet Michael Paull has been named CEO of the streaming platform jointly owned by MLB Advanced Media, Walt Disney (DIS) and the National Hockey League.Paull, who had been at Amazon since 2012, was most recently the vice president of Amazon's digital video operations and oversaw Amazon Channels' content, product, technology, operations and marketing.""In his new role, Paull will set the vision and guide this new venture, originally grown out of MLBAM, as he leads its transformation into an independent company driving sustainable high growth,"" according to the official statement from MLB Advanced Media.Disney shares fell 0.1% to 109.98 in the stock market today but still within buy range. Amazon, which is reportedly looking to add live sports to its own video lineup, climbed 1.35% to 856.44, rising further into its buy range.The BAMTech move comes amid a rapidly changing media landscape that has traditional players such as Disney, CBS (CBS) and others deploying a wide range of strategies in order to adapt.The House of Mouse acquired a 33% stake in BAMTech last year for $1 billion. It has articulated plans for the streamer to launch and distribute an ESPN-branded over-the-top subscription service. It is expected to launch this year.Disney is also a joint owner of streaming service Hulu, a Netflix (NFLX) rival, while Disney-owned Marvel has a four-show deal with Netflix.And the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Disney's yet-to-be-announced streaming bundle deal is with Google's YouTube, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL).IBD'S TAKE: Despite subscription declines at ESPN, Walt Disney head Bob Iger continues to sound bullish on the premium sports cable network. Here's why.Paull is no stranger to the traditional media world. His background includes stints at Sony (SNE) Pictures Entertainment, 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) Fox Entertainment Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Time Warner (TWX).RELATED:FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleForce Friday II Will Unveil 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' ToysDisney Chief's Confidence In ESPN Comes In Part From ...

111,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) was subject to mixed reviews Thursday, with one set of Wall Street analysts downgrading the stock and another raising its price target.Pivotal Research handed out a slew of downgrades in the media and tech sectors, as the firm updates its models to ""account for minor changes in earnings expectations and more significant changes to costs of capital associated with new political risks following the recent US elections.""While Disney's studio arm is performing ""spectacularly well,"" the company received a downgrade from Pivotal to sell from hold.""Once again, costs of capital are core to the price target change, which fall to a level that is more than -15% below current trading levels, obliging us to downgrade the stock,"" wrote Pivotal's Brian Wieser, noting that yields on 10-year Treasury notes have risen significantly.He said the firm wasn't making any ""meaningful"" changes to its view at an operating level, but noted ""soft TV audience trends, ongoing erosion of ESPN's subscriber base and mixed reports on Shanghai Disneyland from Asian press.""He also called out uncertainty surrounding Disney's succession plan. Current CEO Bob Iger said he will step down next year, and his heir apparent abruptly left the company last year.Pivotal, which cut its price target on Disney to 86 from 102, also downgraded Discovery Communications (DISCA) and CBS (CBS) from buy to hold. The firm maintained a hold on Viacom (VIAB) and buy ratings on 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX).Meanwhile, JPMorgan analyst Alexia Quadrani reiterated an overweight rating on Disney and raised her price target to 124 from 118, calling the media conglomerate's underlying business trends ""healthy, which we expect to translate into healthy longer-term earnings growth.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional networks have been trying to find balance in a modern TV-viewing environment plagued by the threat of cord-cutting. That has led some players, like CBS, to maintain its own streaming service while agreeing to join pure-play platforms like Hulu.The bank's confidence in the company is bolstered by ""stable"" affiliate revenue growth and solid advertising in its cable segment, a ""significant"" market share lead by its studio unit, and well-performing parks and consumer products segments.""We believe Disney is one of the best-positioned companies in our media universe with a diverse portfolio of assets and unparalleled intellectual property that the company is able to monetize across its divisions,"" she wrote.Disney shares were down 1.75% at 107.53 in the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Fox dropped 0.9%, Time Warner edged up 0.2%, CBS and Viacom slipped about 1%, while Discovery rose 2.6%.RELATED:Disney's 'Tide Is Turning' But GoPro, McDonald's Served Downgrades

112,FOXA,"AT&T's (T) promotional pricing for its DirecTV Now mobile video service will end on Monday, but it'll still have a $35-per-month offer on the table for consumers as Hulu revs up its live-TV service, which the company has said will be priced ""under $40.""Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Time Warner (TWX) has a 10% stake in Hulu. AT&T has agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion, though President-elect Trump has stated opposition to that merger, fearing too much media strength is being concentrated in too few hands.AT&T launched its video streaming service in late November. While AT&T's ""Go Big"" package of 100-plus channels will cost $60, up from the promotional $35, starting Jan. 9, DirecTV Now will also offer a 60-channel package called ""Live a Little"" for $35.AT&T's ""Live a Little"" package still lacks CBS — which announced a deal with Hulu on Wednesday — and regional sports, but it still could prove a popular offer, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.IBD'S TAKE: CBS is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Media-Diversified group. CBS stock has shot up since forming a cup-with-handle formation in September. Analysts say CBS content is coveted in video streaming packages. CBS could be a takeover target. Learn more about CBS at IBD Stock Checkup. ""Virtually all of the channels that anyone would really want, save for regional sports networks, are included in the $35 ""Live a Little"" package,"" said Moffett in a research report.""The step-up to $50 for the ""Just Right"" package is arguably a sensible one for a genuine sports fan, but the step-ups from there to the ""Go Big"" and ""Gotta Have It!"" packages, at $60 and $70 per month, respectively, are mostly for a bunch of filler,"" Moffett wrote.AT&T stock fell 2.1% in the stock market today to 41.26. CBS stock, which spiked to a nearly three-year high of 66.88 on Wednesday, fell 1.8% Friday to 64.30.AT&T sells Time Warner's HBO for $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee. AT&T on Thursday said Time Warner will not need to transfer any of its FCC licenses to AT&T in order to continue to conduct its business operations after the deal closes. If that's the case, analysts say, regulatory approval of the merger could be smoother.It's not clear that Hulu will get all of CBS' programming. CBS, meanwhile, has its own streaming service, CBS All Access, which has over 1.2 million subscribers.Analysts estimate that Dish Networks' (DISH)Sling-branded streaming service, which starts at $20 monthly but with no broadcast channels, has nearly 1 million subscribers.The DirecTV Now streaming service could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses. AT&T will not count DirecTV Now streaming toward the monthly data caps of its own wireless subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams.RELATED:CBS, Hulu Officially Ink Deal For New Live-TV ServiceAT&T Taps Apple TV In Launching DirecTV Now Streaming-Video Service

116,FOXA,"As AT&T (T) gets peppered with service-quality criticism for its new DirecTV Now video streaming service, any Apple (AAPL) live web TV service remains on the sidelines.Did Apple know something that other upstarts will learn the hard way?DirecTV Now, launched in late November with much fanfare, is sure to be a topic when AT&T reports its Q4 earnings on Jan. 25. Reports in the Wall Street Journal, Verge, Variety and elsewhere say DirecTV Now has been troubled with technical issues, with users encountering problems with live content in particular.AT&T's DirecTV Now service costs $35-and-up per month.Apple, with a corporate culture of perfectionism going back to co-founder Steve Jobs, shelved a streaming web TV service in 2015. Apple continues to sell video streaming hardware vs. Amazon.com (AMZN), Roku, Alphabet (GOOGL)-Google and others.While Apple was stymied in talks with content producers, Apple also was concerned about guaranteeing the delivery of top-quality live video, reports said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock remains in buy range after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 118.12 buy point, closing Friday at 119.04. Learn more about Apple at IBD Stock Checkup.It might have been the right call for the iPhone maker to let others forge ahead in streaming live broadcast content to homes and mobile devices in light of AT&T's woes. While Netflix (NFLX) has perfected the delivery of on-demand TV shows and movies to homes, live content poses many more challenges, analysts say.Next up to test the waters will be Hulu, a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS)and Comcast (CMCSA). Time Warner (TWX), which has agreed to be acquired by AT&T, owns a 10% stake in Hulu, which plans to launch a live TV service in early 2017. Hulu will also offer video-on-demand and DVR.CBS (CBS) recently signed a deal with Hulu, giving it all four broadcast networks, including ABC, NBC and Fox. Local channels on DirecTV Now are available in select markets from ABC, NBC, Fox, where the broadcasters have owned-and-operated stations.AT&T, however, lacks CBS. Still, that's not the main consumer complaint about the service. Users instead have reported problems with reduced video quality, loading content and frequent buffering, as well as error messages.AT&T isn't alone in early technical hiccups. Dish Networks' Sling OTT (over-the-top) service encountered streaming issues during college basketball's March Madness tournament in 2015. Dish's Sling now has about 1 million subscribers, analysts estimate.Sling service starts at $20 a month but doesn't provide programming from the four major broadcast networks.

118,FOXA,"Apple's (AAPL) strategy to take a smaller cut from app developers that sell music and video subscriptions through its online store appears to have paid off.Billings from popular subscription-based apps such as Netflix (NFLX), HBO Now and MLB.com At Bat jumped 74% to $2.7 billion in 2016. Apple highlighted the increase in its annual release on App Store sales.Apple shares revenue with app developers. Apple normally splits app revenue 70-30 with developers, keeping 30% of the purchase price for itself. Apple last year agreed to take 15% instead from app developers that sell subscription-based apps, as opposed to one-time purchases.The policy change made it more attractive for the likes of Netflix, Pandora (P), Spotify, Time Warner's (TWX) HBO, Hulu and others to develop or upgrade iOS apps. Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Apple stock rose 0.53% in the stock market today to 116.63. Apple stock has formed a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 118.12.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix and Broadcom, and nontechs such as Goldman Sachs, Freeport McMoRan, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta, are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Apple says that overall in 2016 developers earned more than $20 billion, an increase of 40% from 2015. Apple said Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run were drivers of 2016 growth, with Match Group's (MTCH) Tinder also a popular downloaded app.""2016 was a record-shattering year for the App Store, generating $20 billion for developers, and 2017 is off to a great start with Jan. 1 as the single biggest day ever on the App Store,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in the company's press release.Apple doesn't break out its revenue share. Revenue includes in-app purchases, paid downloads, and fees for subscriptions.UBS in August estimated that Apple's App Store revenue would grow 24% in fiscal 2016, ended Sept. 30, to $5.73 billion. In the current year, UBS estimated 18% growth to $6.76 billion.Credit Suisse, in a research note Thursday, reiterated its outperform rating and 150 price target on Apple stock, saying Q4 likely marked the sixth quarter in a row of accelerating Apple App Store growth.RELATED:Apple Invests $1 Billion In SoftBank Vision FundApple, Comcast, Intel Stocks Climb Even As Buybacks Slow

120,FOXA,"Examples abound about how internet, media and telecom companies are accelerating their push into mobile video:Why the rush?As more consumers watch video on mobile phones, the U.S. advertising market hit a milestone in 2016: Digital ad spending surpassed TV ad spending for the first time, projected market tracker eMarketer.Desktop PC display and search ads are still the biggest categories of digital spending. But mobile ad spending has emerged as the main driver of digital revenue, jumping 45% to $46 billion in 2016, forecasts eMarketer.By 2019, mobile ad spending is expected to represent one-third of total media ad spending in the U.S., mainly driven by video ads.Oft-called the third screen after broadcast TV and PCs, mobile ranking must be adjusted, says Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics.""Mobile is eating the internet,"" said Entner, coining a phrase similar to venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's ""Why Software Is Eating the World"" essay five years ago.""Seventy percent of mobile traffic is video,"" Entner added. ""The mobile device is turning into the first screen to entertain and inform yourself. It was the third screen, now it's becoming the first screen, overtaking television and the desktop.""John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile US (TMUS), has a mantra of his own: ""All content is going to the internet, and the internet is going mobile.""T-Mobile in 2016 shook up the wireless market with free video streaming for many popular apps.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix's success adding subscribers outside the U.S. is just one reason it makes the IBD Leaderboard, a listing of top stocks poised to possibly bring the biggest gains. See what other companies make the current list.So how does a stock investor play the mobile video trend? Let's imagine a word association game. What companies come to mind first for ""mobile video""?Probably not Apple (AAPL) — yet. Probably not Netflix (NFLX), for that matter.Apple's huge base of iPhone users represent a lot of mobile screens, but Apple apparently has shelved plans for its own web TV service, unable to forge a deal with broadcasters. Apple, though, reportedly has lowered the amount it charges to sell video services through its widely used App Store, which should increase the movies and TV shows offered to iPhone users from other parties. Apple reportedly cut its fee to 15% from 30% of monthly subscription billings.Netflix, the top provider of subscription video-on-demand services, doesn't sell advertising. Netflix has invested in long-form, original content rather than shorter video clips. Netflix in early 2016 accounted for only 3.7% of mobile data traffic but 35% of fixed-line broadband traffic, said a report from networking gear maker Sandvine. Its study doesn't measure Wi-Fi network usage, where Netflix traffic might be high.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) make a match for mobile video investing plays. Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2016 and has agreed to buy Yahoo (YHOO). Verizon aims to build a digital ad platform rivaling those of Google and Facebook.And in late 2015, Verizon launched its G090 mobile video service, which targets millennials. The free, ad-supported Go90 service offers a mix of original web TV series, live sports, concert streaming and more. While Go90 has been off to a rocky start (Verizon has not disclosed any operating metrics), the telecom firm has brought in new executives to reboot content and build a bigger audience for ads.AT&T , meanwhile, in late November launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service, which starts at $35 per month. The linchpin to AT&T's mobile video strategy is allowing its wireless subscribers to stream DirecTV Now without eating into their monthly data caps.Entner says AT&T will pressure other new entrants in live TV streaming — such as Hulu, Amazon and Google's YouTube — to develop ""mobile-first"" strategies. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), and Comcast.AT&T in late October agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. Its assets include HBO, sports-oriented Turner Broadcasting, and a stake in Hulu.The Time Warner deal is designed to ""get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices, delivered on any screen, particularly mobile,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts.If AT&T's DirecTV Now succeeds, it could pressure Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) to acquire a wireless firm, perhaps T-Mobile, some analysts speculate.The conundrum for AT&T and traditional media companies pushing into mobile video is that the younger age groups advertisers covet tend to watch shorter pieces, not long-form content. User-generated and social-media-shared content is still the biggest part of mobile video consumption. And live streaming via Facebook, YouTube and Twitter's (TWTR) Periscope compete for millennial attention against streaming pay-TV services such as CBS (CBS) All Access, which recently disclosed it has 1.2 million subscribers.On Facebook's Q3 earnings call Nov. 2, CEO Mark Zuckerberg trumpeted plans to become a ""video-first"" company. Zuckerberg says that within five years most of what people consume online will be video. Analysts speculate Facebook could develop a stand-alone app that competes directly with YouTube.Then, there's the Facebook-Instagram rival Snapchat, which has some 400 million users. Snapchat claims that it has some 10 billion daily video views. It limits videos to 10 seconds in length. Snapchat also offers its ""Discover"" portal of short-clip web videos. Owner Snap has filed for a confidential IPO and is expected to debut on the stock market early in 2017.While Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising, one question is whether another top digital publisher will emerge, such as Snapchat or Verizon, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a recent research report.As for the question near the top of this story: Asked what comes to his mind first when he hears the term ""mobile video,"" Entner quickly replied ""YouTube.""""Mobile video is still dominated by YouTube,"" he said. ""There is tremendous innovation. People you've never heard of start their own video channel and suddenly have more followers than people who watch episodes of 'The Big Bang Theory.'""RELATED:Alphabet, Facebook Dominate Mobile App Downloads

121,FOXA,"CBS (CBS) and Hulu have officially made an agreement to offer CBS sports and entertainment programming on Hulu's yet-to-debut live-TV service, according to a statement from Hulu.The new service will be priced under $40 and include its on-demand library and cloud DVR capability, said Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins separately at the Citi Internet, Media & Telecoms conference. It will also include a ""brand new, easy to use, more personalized user experience across both its live TV and SVOD services.""CBS has its own streaming service, CBS All Access, and was until now a notable entertainment heavyweight that had not yet joined Hulu's new package. Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX) — which all have a stake in Hulu, along with Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal — have struck deals to live-stream shows on Hulu.Hopkins said in the release that CBS is ""vital"" to a successful live-TV offering.""With 21st Century Fox, Disney, Turner and now CBS on board, our new live service will offer one of the most valuable sports, news and entertainment lineups anywhere – from ESPN, Fox Sports, CBS Sports and TNT to ABC, CBS, FOX and The Disney Channel,"" he said in the statement.Getting all the major broadcasters on board with a single streaming TV option has proved to be a challenge.The major players have each adopted different approaches to a modern entertainment field that includes younger viewers who avoid traditional cable bundles and online pure-plays Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).CBS reportedly plans to keep some of its popular content for itself, according to an earlier Wall Street Journal story Wednesday.The network will not offer full seasons of current shows such as ""NCIS"" to Hulu live-streaming subscribers, and will instead only provide ""a few recent episodes of such shows"" on demand, said the Journal. Much of Hulu's early appeal was in its offering of current-season shows, the day after they aired.CBS will also offer up programming from CBS Sports Network and cable channel Pop. The deal is said to give Hulu the option to include the Smithsonian Channel and teen-focused CW Network down the road, as well as offer Showtime as an add-on, according to the Journal. CBS will make more than $3 per monthly subscription, said Journal sources, with ""increases over the multiyear deal that could get to more than $4.""CBS shares finished trading up 2.1% to 65.74 on the stock market today. Netflix added 1.5% to 129.41, while Walt Disney climbed 1.3% to 107.44. Comcast tacked on 1.2% to 69.87. Fox and Amazon were up fractionally to 28.25 and 757.18, respectively.

Defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT), which is not on the Dow but is an S&P 500 stalwart, also broke out of a consolidation on Friday but was under pressure early Monday.Apple rose 1.5% to 176.52 in morning trade in Friday's stock market trading, clearing 176.34 buy point and hitting a record high. On Friday, Apple carved out a flat base with the minimum five weeks.Apple now has a 96 Composite Rating, which is important. All-time winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of big runs.Microsoft cleared its own short flat base on Friday, rallying 2.55% to 86.85, just above its 86.30 entry.

124,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) fell notably short of revenue forecasts, posting a surprise decline, as Sports Illustrated reported that over 100 more layoffs are set to take place at ESPN after Thanksgiving.XBut a slew of breaking news on the conference call helped reverse the stock's late laggard action on Thursday, as Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the launch of a brand new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, said the new Disney-only streaming platform would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix (NFLX), and gave the new ESPN direct-to-consumer service a name: ESPN Plus.Though analysts no doubt had some major questions, chief among them, ""What's going on with the reported talks to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA)?"", Disney management would only say that it does not comment on press speculation.The Mouse disappointed analyst forecasts for growth to $1.12 in per-share earnings on revenue of $13.15 billion, unexpectedly reporting 3% declines on both the top and bottom lines to $1.07 in earnings per share, excluding items, on $12.78 billion in revenue.Shares initially sank, then reversed higher for a 0.8% gain in late trading in the stock market today, after ending the regular session up 1.5% to 102.68. Disney had logged a solid rise going into earnings, prompted by a CNBC report Monday that 21st Century Fox had held now-inactive talks to sell most of itself to its larger media peer.Iger offhandedly unloaded a number of juicy bits of breaking news, telling those on the call that Disney had struck an agreement with ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" director Rian Johnson for a new three-picture deal. Johnson will write and direct the first of the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, said Lucasfilm.The new Disney-only streaming platform, which is set to rival Netflix when it rolls out in 2019, will feature Disney, Pixar and Marvel content for a total of ""thousands"" of hours of content, he said.Netflix shares dipped slightly late after closing down 1.3% to 193.90. Fox, which had reportedly held talks to sell most of itself to the House of Mouse, rose 2.2% Thursday, adding to its big weekly gain after reporting solid quarterly results late Wednesday.The upcoming ad-supported ESPN Plus service will launch in the spring, announced Iger, adding that Disney will discuss pricing at a later date.Some analysts have argued that Disney's studio hits and theme parks are enough to offset weakness at ESPN. Operating income from Disney's Media Networks segment, which houses ESPN, dropped 12% to $1.475 billion as subscribers and average viewership declined.But Studio Entertainment Q4 operating income skid even more sharply, dropping 43% year over year. Consumer Products & Interactive Media fell 12%, while Parks and Resorts rose 7%.Only the theme parks segment topped operating income expectations, according to CNBC, citing StreetAccount estimates.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Disney took some heat this week for its decision — then reversal — to ban Los Angeles Times film critics from press screenings after the outlet's investigative unit published an expose on Disney's contributions to the city of Anaheim, where Disneyland is located.

AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation.

Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative.""

Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency.

Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs.

136,FOXA,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) cheered Wall Street bulls and confounded bears late Monday after it smashed expectations for new subscriber additions in the third quarter and guided higher for the current quarter.XNetflix stock fell 1.6% to close at 199.48 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, Netflix notched a record high of 204.38.Netflix late Monday said it signed up 5.3 million net new streaming subscribers in the third quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations for 4.5 million. For the December quarter, Netflix expects to add 6.3 million new subscribers, edging analysts' consensus view of 6.25 million.Netflix ended the September quarter with 109.25 million streaming subscribers worldwide, including 52.77 million in the U.S. and 56.48 million in international markets.While its subscriber numbers were a positive surprise, Netflix delivered mixed financial results in the third quarter. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company reported earnings per share of 29 cents, up 142% year over year, on revenue of $2.99 billion, up 30%, in the third quarter. Analysts expected 32 cents and $2.97 billion.In the fourth quarter, Netflix expects to earn 41 cents a share, up 173%, on sales of $3.27 billion, up 32%. Analysts were modeling for 33 cents and $3.15 billion.Netflix stock received price-target hikes from at least eight Wall Street firms that rate it as buy: KeyBanc Capital Markets, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer, Piper Jaffray, Pivotal Research Group, RBC Capital Markets and UBS.Pivotal is the most bullish of the group. It upped its target to 270 from 200.Netflix is benefiting from a ""very powerful combination"" of original programming that generates strong subscriber growth plus demonstrated pricing power, Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock surged above its buy range in Monday trading after the company's shares hit a buy point Oct. 5, coming out of a cup with handle. With a Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99, Netflix leads IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related group.""Netflix offers consumers an increasingly compelling entertainment experience on virtually any device, without commercials at a relatively low cost,"" Wlodarczak said. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous circle, as the larger their subscriber base grows (and their average revenue per user increases) the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service (and reduces existing subscriber churn and increases the ability to take future price increases) and dramatically increases barriers to entry.""Netflix also has been helped by continued increases in broadband availability and speeds globally and the fact that in most of the world net neutrality regulations allow Netflix to piggyback for nearly free on the substantial investment made by cable and telecom companies, he said.Netflix's stock rise has left bears scratching their heads.Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said investors need to consider Netflix's ""cringe-worthy cash burn"" and growing competition.""We don't expect Netflix to become meaningfully profitable on a cash basis for several years, and we don't expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of this decade; even then, we think that positive free cash flow will remain elusive unless the company decides to materially increase price and sacrifice growth,"" Pachter said in a note to clients. ""We think that Netflix is destined to be a cash-burning high-growth company until it changes its strategy and accepts its fate as a highly profitable slow-growth company.""Netflix increased its 2018 content spending guidance to $7 billion to $8 billion, up from $7 billion. That compares with more than $6 billion in content spending in 2017 and $5 billion in 2016.Pachter reiterated his underperform rating on Netflix, but upped his price target to 93 from 88.In a letter to investors, Netflix addressed concerns about media companies like Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) pulling their content from Netflix.""Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies,"" Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in the letter. ""While we have multiyear deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.""This quarter, Netflix is releasing the crime drama series ""Mindhunter"" from director David Fincher, the Will Smith movie ""Bright,"" and new seasons of ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown.""Netflix faces many competitors in the streaming video space, but has a ""good head start,"" Hastings said. Rivals include Amazon.com (AMZN), Hulu and CBS (CBS) now and soon Apple (AAPL) and Disney will join the fray.On an investor call Monday, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos noted the company's progress in making hit original films.Last quarter, Netflix released three movies that would have been ""sizable successes"" at movie theaters if they had been released theatrically: ""Death Note,"" ""Naked"" and ""To the Bone,"" he said.""We will wrap up this year with our biggest original film project 'Bright,' which is Will Smith starring with Joel Edgerton and directed by David Ayer,"" he said. ""It's a big-budget event movie"" that will show people the potential for Netflix's original movie initiative.

142,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) and a bevy of major Hollywood studios have teamed up in the launch of a free app and site that serves as a hub for viewers' digital movie libraries. Heads up, Netflix (NFLX).XMovies Anywhere is kicking off with more than 7,300 films from Walt Disney Studios; Sony (SNE)-owned Sony Pictures; 20th Century Fox, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA); Comcast (CMCSA)-owned Universal Pictures; and Warner Bros. Entertainment, owned by Time Warner (TWX). The service can be viewed using Amazon (AMZN) Video, Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Play, Apple (AAPL) iTunes or Vudu.Unlike Netflix, Movies Anywhere is not a subscription service but a digital locker for movies that users have purchased.Movies Anywhere is not the first attempt by studios to create such a service. It follows UltraViolet, which didn't take off, and Disney Movies Anywhere. Movies Anywhere is built upon the same digital-rights system architecture as Disney's version of the service, according to The Verge.Viewers will ""never have to remember where they purchased a film or which device they can watch it on, because all of their eligible movies will be centralized"" on the service's library and made available across platforms, said Movies Anywhere General Manager Karin Gilford in a statement through Disney.The service can be accessed through a variety of devices, including Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Roku, and Android and iOS devices. And users can get digital copy codes from Movies Anywhere for Blu-rays and DVDs they've bought.To sweeten the launch and lure in new users, the service is offering viewers five free movies when they connect to two digital retailer accounts.Separately, Disney is planning to launch a stand-alone streaming service.Disney shares fell 1.6% in the stock market today, as Guggenheim downgraded the House of Mouse and cut its price target.

143,FOXA,"Cable TV companies and media stocks sold off on renewed worries that pay TV cord-cutting is accelerating after AT&T (T) preannounced Q3 financial numbers, including the loss of 90,000 video subscribers.X""We believe cord-cutting continues to gain steam as streaming builds momentum,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a report. He estimated that the pay TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year, based on recent management commentary.AT&T plunged 6.1% to close at 35.86 on the stock market today. AT&T also blamed recent hurricanes for video subscriber losses. Comcast (CMCSA), which in early September warned of video subscriber losses, shed 3.3% to 36.19.Comcast had attributed some of its video subscriber weakness to aggressive promotions launched by AT&T's landline ""U-verse""-branded TV service. Analysts say AT&T's DirecTV satellite TV service likely suffered the bulk of its subscriber losses in the third quarter.Shares in satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) fell 5.1% to 49.03 on Thursday. While AT&T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2016, analysts say Dish has had trouble finding a suitor amid continued subscriber losses.Both AT&T and Dish have launched internet video services. AT&T said it added 300,000 online DirecTV Now subscribers in the third quarter, offsetting some of the traditional pay TV losses. However, both AT&T and Dish garner less profit from internet services than traditional pay TV, analysts say.While AT&T is losing a net 90,000 video subscribers, it's traditional pay TV customer losses in third quarter are higher — 390,000 — partially offset by the addition of 300,000 internet video subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.UBS estimates that Dish's Sling service has 1.8 million subscribers and DirecTV Now 760,000.

144,FOXA,"Saturday's matchup between boxing legend Floyd Mayweather and UFC lightweight champ Conor McGregor is promising to be epic, if the hype is to be believed, with Showtime parent CBS (CBS) poised to reap the rewards.XBut the shift toward digital-heavy entertainment consumption has changed the way pay-per-view is offered. CNET notes that cordcutters can watch the fight without a cable or satellite subscription, and instead watch it on Showtime's iOS and Apple TV apps or funnel UFC's stream through Apple TV, Amazon Fire TX, Xbox One and other devices.The Aug. 26 fight, which is expected to reel in an estimated five million pay-per-view buyers, costs a hefty $99.95 on UFC's or Showtime's PPV stream. That would translate to about $500 million, more than the reported $460 million made from 2015's Mayweather-Pacquiao pay-per-view sales.(Despite the steep streaming price, that's still lot cheaper than trying to secure ringside seats: Single tickets to see the fight in-person at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas start at $2,500 in the nosebleeds and go up to $10,000 closer to the ring.)Even with the massive expected pay-per-view numbers, the fight may not be as big of a win for CBS as some may think.Barclays noted on Aug. 8 that Showtime's streaming service potentially helped drive its better-than-expected margins in the second quarter, but its Q3 margins ""will be impacted by the Mayweather/McGregor pay per view event which tends to have low margins.""The bout won't stream anywhere else besides directly on UFC and Showtime (and Sky Sports in the U.K.), but 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) Fox Sports — a broadcast partner of Ultimate Fighting Championship and Premier Boxing Champions — also stands to benefit from the buzz, with Fox, FS1, FS2 and Fox Deportes airing pre-fight coverage starting the night before. Fox and Fox Deportes are set to air the opening acts: Two hours of preliminary boxing matches are slated to kick off at 7 p.m. Eastern on Saturday.When does the Mayweather-McGregor fight start? The main card begins at 9 p.m. ET.For the uninitiated, the matchup is a crossover brawl for the ages, pitting a 40-year-old boxing champion against a 29-year-old UFC star, with plenty of trash talk leading up to the main event.And McGregor, though younger, heavier and taller, will be on Mayweather's turf in the boxing ring. Since McGregor will not be able to kick, grapple or use his mixed martial arts know-how on his opponent, it's hard to tell whether this crossover will be more of a curiosity, a la Steve Urkel on ""Full House,"" or more of a ""Batman vs. Superman""-style showdown between equals.Even ringside doctors are worried. They do not condone the fight and have voiced concerns over serious injuries, given McGregor's inexperience in the ring. He has never boxed professionally before.RELATED:Big Media Just Gave Sports Fans Another Reason To Cut The Cord8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix Subscribers

149,FOXA,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review.

After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success.

It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

150,FOXA,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) has reached a tentative deal to gain full control of British broadcaster Sky for 18.5 billion pounds ($23.2 billion).Independent directors from both companies have agreed to a tentative deal, but it's not clear if an actual, complete offer will be made and accepted.Fox will pay 10.75 pounds ($13.55) per Sky share in cash, a 36% premium to Sky's Thursday close. Sky shares soared 26.7% to 10 pounds in London trading. Fox shares initially rose, but reversed to trade down 1.5% at 28.21 on the stock market today.Fox already is Sky's top shareholder with a 39% stake. There has been speculation for years that Fox and Sky would merge, giving Fox a much bigger platform for its content in Europe. The weaker pound following the Brexit vote makes the deal cheaper.The Fox-Sky deal comes as CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) mull a merger after a split several years ago. Meanwhile, AT&T (T) is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), in another content-distribution deal.CBS shares fell 1.6%, while Viacom lost 0.5%. AT&T dipped 0.1%, while Time Warner edged up 0.7%.

151,FOXA,"As competition mounts with AT&T (T) and others, Dish Network (DISH) is readying a new streaming device for its Sling internet video service that combines web TV with free over-the-air broadcast channels as well as Netflix (NFLX) programming.Dish Network's AirTV Player could debut at the CES trade show in January, analysts say.Analysts expect video-streaming competition to intensify in 2017, with Hulu, Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube and possibly Amazon.com (AMZN) launching new products, some with live TV programming. AT&T launched DirecTV Now, a mobile-first product in late November. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner (TWX).Dish Network in November said its Sling service would be available on Comcast's X1 digital set-top boxes. Analysts say Sling may appeal to Comcast customers who want more international channels. Comcast's X1 platform also recently added a Netflix app.Dish Network stock edged up 2.1% to 59.58 on the stock market today. That's just above a 59.57 buy point, retaking that key level as it consolidates near that key level in recent days.Netflix rose 1.1% to 126.50, moving toward a buy point in a long base.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a member of IBD's Leaderboard, with shares up 11% in 2016. Netflix stock has formed a large handle in a cup base going back a year, with a buy point of 129.39. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Dish Network has not disclosed subscriber totals for the Sling service, launched in early 2015. Some analysts estimate Sling is nearing the 1 million mark for paying subscribers.The Sling service starts at $20 per month for about 30 channels, but several broadcast networks are missing from the basic package. Add-on packages cost $10. Netflix's service would also cost extra if consumers buy the AirTV Player device.AT&T's new DirecTV Now service starts at $35 a month. CBS (CBS) is missing from AT&T's broadcaster lineup.Dish Network's satellite TV subscriber base has been slowly shrinking. Dish Network had 13.64 million pay TV subscribers as of Sept. 30, including Sling customers, down from 13.91 million a year earlier. Dish Network has been looking for a wireless partner to launch mobile video services.RELATED:Will The Launch Of AT&T DirecTV Now Herald Net Neutrality's End?Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU

152,FOXA,"Amazon (AMZN) has launched Amazon Prime Video in 200 countries, including India but not China, ratcheting up the competition with Netflix (NFLX) in online streaming.Amazon Prime Video had been in just five countries. Netflix airs in some 190 countries, with China the only major holdout. Amazon focused on India with its announcement.""India has one of the richest and most vibrant entertainment industries in the world,"" Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios, said in the company's press release. ""It's no secret that Amazon is making a big investment in India and is happy to take original content, created by Indian talent, to audiences worldwide.""Amazon — which originally billed itself as ""the world's biggest bookstore"" — is moving full throttle into video services, as well as delivery services, online video and music services, tablets, personal digital assistants, and no doubt more arenas besides e-commerce and cloud services. Even physical stores are now part of the plan.Just on Wednesday alone, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tweeted out the company's first delivery via drone, and Wynn Las Vegas announced it would equip each of its rooms with an Amazon Echo smart speaker.IBD'S TAKE: For much of 2016, you would have found Amazon on the IBD Leaderboard. Only the best stocks at or near buy points make this exclusive list. See which of the FANG stocks currently makes the list.Amazon stock fell 0.69% to 768.96 in the stock market today, and has been trading below its 50-day moving average for nearly six weeks. The stock is consolidating, with an 847.31 buy point.Amazon Prime Video will be bundled with Amazon Prime subscribers in 19 countries and is available at no additional cost to subscribers in India, France, Canada, Belgium and Italy and Spain. Customers in the other new Prime Video territories can sign up at an introductory price of $2.99 per month for the first six months, starting with a free seven-day trial at PrimeVideo.com, the company said.Amazon does not say how many customers it has to Amazon Prime, which is available in the U.S. for $99 per year and gets them access to Amazon Prime Video, as well as streaming music, free delivery of goods ordered on Amazon, access to special deals and more. Analysts estimate there are currently about 55 million Amazon Prime customers.Netflix reported having 86.7 million customers worldwide in its third quarter earnings statement, of which 36 million are outside the U.S. Netflix, in addition to the increased competition from Amazon is confronting a more aggressive Hulu, which plans to launch a live streaming TV service in 2017, in addition to its original and third-party content. Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS) NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWC)Also, this month, Amazon announced it added HBO and Cinemax to Amazon Channels for a monthly fee, upping its battle with Disney, AT&T (T) and other providers of video streaming services, in addition to Netflix.Amazon's new offerings follow AT&T's launch of DirecTV Now, the latest contender to enter the over-the-top streaming service arena.RELATED:Amazon's Threat To Netflix Grows As Video Content Spending Booms Amazon In Talks For Live Sports Package Available To Prime MembersAmazon Set To Disrupt Retailers In Apparel, Groceries, ServicesAmazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be ApparelBoost In Technology Budgets Benefits Amazon, Microsoft, SalesforceAmazon Stock Hits Another High As Amazon Prime Users Keep 'Ramping'

153,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) is in talks with other Hollywood studios about joining its Disney Movies Anywhere service, which lets people watch and store their online movie purchases at a single site, Bloomberg reported.Disney Movies Anywhere has movies from all its brands, including Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Anywhere users can store and rewatch digital films whether they are bought at Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) iTunes, Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Play or Wal-Mart (WMT).It's a way for Disney to continue to generate revenue from movie after the theater run with DVD sales plunging in the era of Netflix (NFLX) and streaming media.But offering a one-stop digital film locker and library would be a lot more attractive with other major studios. Disney Movies Anywhere competes with a similar service, UltraViolet has films from Warner Bros. (Time Warner (TWX)), Universal Pictures (Comcast (CMCSA)), Sony (SNE), Paramount (Viacom (VIAB)) and 20th Century Fox (21st Century Fox (FOXA)), along with many other smaller players.To form a digital media locker agreement, Disney may have to agree to change its service's name, Bloomberg reported.Many of the same parent companies already are allied in streaming media via Hulu. Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast each own 30% of Hulu, with Time Warner recently acquiring a 10% stake. Hulu, which like rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video is beefing up original content, plans to introduce live streaming TV in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: With ESPN subscribers falling, Disney is relying on its Star Wars and Marvel franchises more than ever. Here are early 'Rogue One' reviews ahead of the movie's weekend premiere. 
"
154,FOXA,"Viacom (VIAB) said it is no longer exploring a possible merger with CBS (CBS) after Shari Redstone, vice chairwoman of both companies pulled a proposal to reunite the media giants, while Verizon Communications (VZ) has reportedly expressed interest in CBS.Such a move from the telecom giant would follow AT&T's (T) $85.4 billion bid to buy Time Warner (TWX), in another content-distribution deal.Shares of CBS closed down 0.6% on the stock market today, after falling as much as 5.2% earlier and reversing higher on the Verizon interest, which was reported by CNBC and the New York Post. Verizon stock rose 0.5%.Viacom, which has seen its ratings plunge for cable channels such as Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, tumbled 9.4%. Viacom also named Bob Bakish as its permanents president and CEO. AT&T rose 1.8%, and Time Warner edged down 0.6%.Earlier, National Amusements sent a letter to both boards backing interim Viacom CEO Bob Bakish as permanent chief and stating that it wants Viacom to remain independent. Shari Redstone and her father, Sumner Redstone, control Viacom and CBS via National Amusements, their privately held movie theater company.""Over the past few months, after careful assessment and meetings with the leadership of both companies, we have concluded that this is not the right time to merge the companies.,"" the Redstones wrote in the National Amusements letter. ""Following the management changes that the Viacom Board put in place, we have been very impressed with the forward‐looking thinking and strategic plan being pursued under Bob Bakish's leadership.""In September, the Redstones proposed a merger. Last month, Redstone said she and her father never supported the Viacom-CBS split 10 years ago.CBS investors had been lukewarm about uniting the No. 1 TV broadcaster with a sagging cable operator focused on children, teens and young adults.CBS CEO Les Moonves wanted a Viacom merger only if got control over the Redstone family's voting shares, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.On Friday, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) announced a tentative deal to buy British broadcaster Sky. Fox already owns 39% of Sky. A cheaper pound post-Brexit vote made it cheaper for a long-rumored merger. 21st Century Fox sank 6.6% Monday, dropping below its 50- and 200-day lines.RELATED:21st Century Fox Reaches Preliminary Deal To Buy U.K. Sister Firm Sky

156,FOXA,"Media baron John Malone says Walt Disney (DIS) would be more attractive to Apple (AAPL) as an acquisition if Disney spun off sports channel ESPN.In an interview with CNBC, Malone praised AT&T's (T) move to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX), saying it gives the telecom conglomerate much-needed diversification. AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in cash and stock on Oct. 24.Apple reportedly has passed on making a counter bid for Time Warner, despite the urging of Goldman Sachs bankers.Malone says Apple could be interested in Disney, if it shed ESPN along with billions of dollars in contracts for sports-programming rights. Disney reports earnings late Thursday. Apple stock fell 2.8% while Disney stock rose a fraction in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Disney stock has been a laggard and has a Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing, of only 62 out of a possible 99. Disney stock has edged up since the AT&T-Time Warner deal was announced but is still down about 9% in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""If I had to guess what you will see is a split of Disney, with ESPN spun off,"" Malone told CNBC. ""And probably ESPN could be owned and protected by a distributor in the U.S. And Apple would be more interested in (the rest of Disney — movie studio, broadcaster ABC, theme parks).""They would have a lot more in common in terms of international branding, because fundamentally (Apple CEO) Tim Cook's a global player.""Disney's CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. Unlike 21st Century Fox (FOXA) or Viacom (VIA), Disney is not family-controlled.Malone could himself have an angle, depending on what Disney does. In addition to his voting control of Liberty Media (LMCA), Liberty Global and other parts of the Liberty empire, Malone is the biggest shareholder in Discovery (DISCA) and owns stakes in Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).Malone's Liberty Broadband owns about 18% of Charter Communications (CHTR). Charter is the No. 2 cable firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).""If somebody went after Disney, my guess is Apple would have to finally make a decision,"" Malone said. ""Somehow or another there's going to be some solution, because, you know, otherwise Disney should be trading at a substantially higher multiple. … They went long (sports-rights contract renewals) and at the moment that looks adverse.""RELATED:Walt Disney Reports Q4 Earnings Late: What To WatchAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?

157,FOXA,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average. Is that much cash normal?Macauley: We've averaged about 8% over the past seven years. We've had a lot of inflows. We're patient about deploying new capital.IBD: How long does it normally take you to build a full position in a stock?Macauley: Every situation is different. It may take two weeks on average.As a winner in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards, it outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Managers Brian Macauley, David Rainey and Ira Rothberg have been at the helm since 2009.Hennessy Focus is  up 6% this year, in line with its midcap growth peers but trailing the S&P 500. Among the fund's top-performing holdings this year are Marlin business Services, Aon and IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 member Charles Schwab.The fund's assets were focused on just 21 names as of Sept. 30, with about 40% of assets alloted to the top biggest holdings.

158,FOXA,"As President-elect Donald Trump uses Twitter (TWTR) and online video to bypass the major media, perhaps this is the next logical step: Even the media are bypassing the media.Amazon.com (AMZN) and top execs from the big four networks will join Netflix (NFLX) in skipping the Television Critics Association's semiannual press event in January, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday, citing sources.Amazon will join web-streaming rival Netflix, which had previously said it would not attend the event in any capacity, according to the Reporter. Meanwhile, executives from Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC, Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC, CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) will not take part in panels. CW execs will take part.Several shows will participate, though the exec events have tended to make the bigger headlines over the years.The networks reportedly are worried about the time and effort involved in taking part, especially for shows in production. Executives may not want to face a grilling from industry experts that can make or break their careers.And in an age of constant media coverage, with actors, producers and others on TV and social media frequently, content providers may feel they don't need the TCA as much to promote their shows.

159,FOXA,"When Walt Disney (DIS) reports fourth-quarter and year-end earnings late Thursday, it wouldn't be a stretch to expect more of the same: horn-tooting about the studio's hits, some nice words about the new theme park in Shanghai, and a vigorous defense of ESPN's health.Earnings are expected to dip 3% to $1.16 a share on flattish revenue growth to $13.52 billion.But expect ESPN to be in focus in the wake of Disney's data fight with Nielsen last week, in which the ratings company estimated that the sports network lost 621,000 subscribers in just one month. ESPN disputed the figures, but after pulling and double-checking its data, Nielsen reaffirmed Friday that its ""estimates were accurate as originally released.""ESPN reportedly called the figures a ""historic anomaly.""Either way, that will likely bring ESPN back to the forefront of Thursday's conference call, more than a year after CEO Bob Iger's comments about a modest subscriber decline at the cable network spurred a nervous breakdown across the media sector.Disney shares have yet to retake their all-time high of 122.08, reached on Aug. 4, 2015, the day Iger made those remarks during an earnings call.Separately, Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil estimates that ESPN  is ""at least 3 to 4 (million) subscribers lower than expectations heading into the new NBA contract from the time they signed it"" two years ago.Shares of Disney closed up 2.1% to 94.43 on the stock market today amid a broad market rally. Peer Time Warner (TWX) — which recently agreed to be acquired by AT&T (T) — rose 1.5% to finish at 87.74, and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), which reported an increase in cable subscribers last week, added 1.7% to 27.39.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, bandied about as a potential — but unlikely — acquiree of Disney, has been plunking down a pretty penny for original content. Here's how that is impacting its perception on Wall Street: ""Netflix: Still A Hot Tech Play Or A Media Stock That Acts Like Tech?""While the media-networks segment has traditionally been Disney's biggest moneymaker, the studio arm continues to blaze a hot trail, led by a string of Marvel successes and a seemingly never-ending pipeline of ""Star Wars"" films.Marvel's ""Doctor Strange"" brought in $84.9 million at the domestic box office on opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo, with a global gross of over $325 million so far. That, along with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" should make for a solid start to Disney's new fiscal year, although some analysts see a tough comparison to ""The Force Awakens""' epic box-office haul last year.In focus for Thursday's Q4 report, however, should be ""Finding Dory,"" the Pixar sequel to ""Finding Nemo."" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers expects the movie to help drive studio revenue up 10% for the quarter.In contrast to the analysts concerned about ESPN, Cowen's Doug Creutz offers up a different worry: that the House of Mouse is ""earning an unsustainable portion of film industry profits (over 60% of the total in the first half of 2016), at a time when industry profits are under pressure.""RELATED:Election, Nvidia, Disney, Acacia Dominate Investing Action PlanTime Warner Shrugs Off Low AT&T Breakup Fee, Merger NaysayersMedia Chatter: Tronc Dumped, N.Y.

160,FOXA,"Aiming to make video streaming a big driver of its mobile business, AT&T (T) laid out the nitty-gritty details of its DirecTV Now service, which will start at $35 a month for 100 channels but will go up to $60 after a promotional period ends.AT&T, after the introductory period, also will offer 60 channels for $35 monthly and 80 channels for $50 monthly. While AT&T's promotional price is aggressive, the longer-term pricing for various packages is in line with or above analyst expectations.But users that sign up for the $35 promotion has that rate for as long as they subscribe to the service.If DirecTV Now customers sign up for three months, they qualify for an Apple (AAPL) TV streaming device that normally retails for $150. Customers that commit to one month can get an Amazon.com (AMZN) Fire TV stick that starts at $40.The DirecTV Now streaming service will launch on Wednesday. AT&T did not say when the promotional period will end. AT&T will offer new customers a free, 7-day trial.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock, along with Verizon Communications, were top performers in the first half of 2016 owing to their dividends. Apple and Cisco Systems are other companies that are increasing shareholder returns. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor. AT&T stock was flat in after-hours trading Monday, after it revealed the details of its mobile streaming-video service.""The prices are more reasonable than they had hinted at a few weeks ago,"" Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email. ""But by definition, that means that demand for the product will be lower as well.""I'm sure they'll get some existing customers to trade down, but it will take some time to find out whether cord cutters are willing to pay that much for an OTT service.""AT&T says it's targeting 20 million homes that do not have a pay-TV subscription currently, but the wireless video offering could attract customers of cable TV firms like Comcast (CMCSA), analysts say. With DirecTV satellite and its U-Verse service, AT&T has 25 million pay-TV customers of its own that it does not want to see switch to the lower-cost streaming package, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a research report.""AT&T can't undermine the economics of traditional pay-TV; they would have the most to lose if they did,"" Chaplin said.The DirecTV Now streaming service, though, could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses.AT&T aims to get a jump on Hulu Live, a new offering expected from the joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast's NBC Universal. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) might also launch new streaming services with live content in 2017, analysts say.AT&T will not charge its own wireless subscribers for consuming data tied to the DirecTV Now service, a practice similar to what Verizon Communications (VZ) does with its millennial-focused Go90 service. T-Mobile US (TMUS), meanwhile, provides free streaming of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling service to its subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams. Dish's Sling on Monday said its customers will soon be able to record TV shows and store them online for later viewing.AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, gaining negotiating leverage with content providers. While Fox, Disney and NBCU have joined AT&T's programming lineup, CBS (CBS) is not part of the lineup. CBS has its own stand-alone streaming service.AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services. Like other providers of so-called OTT (over-the-top) services, AT&T will not bear costs for network transport, installation or set-top boxes.Sling last week forged a deal to make its app available on Comcast set-top boxes. Analysts estimate Sling has 800,000 to 1 million subscribers.If AT&T's DirecTV Now is a big success, it could pressure Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) to acquire a wireless firm, perhaps T-Mobile U.S., some analysts have speculated.AT&T is seeking regulatory approval to acquire Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. Time Warner and its HBO, as well as content from Viacom (VIA), A&E, Discovery and Starz, are part of DirecTV Now's channel package. HBO will cost $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee.RELATED:AT&T Swallows Razor-Thin Margins On $35 Video Streaming DealHulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCUJohn Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T Strategy

162,FOXA,"Weak cable ad revenue at 21st Century Fox (FOXA) added to the media sector's woes late Wednesday, after ESPN found itself back in the spotlight during Walt Disney's (DIS) earnings call late Tuesday, thanks to recent prominent job cuts at the sports cable network, a growing over-the-top market and reports of subscriber bleeding across the industry.Fox's adjusted Q1 earnings rose 15% to 54 cents a share, beating views by 6 cents. Revenue grew 5% to $7.56 billion, missing estimates for $7.63 billion as the film division saw 2.8% lower revenue. Cable network revenue ticked up 2.1% to $4.02 billion but domestic ad revenue was flat.Fox shares fell 1.4% after the report, paring earlier late-trading losses, after closing 1.2% lower at 27.90. Disney closed down 2.15% at 109.66 in the stock market today, following its revenue miss and scrutiny over ESPN. Disney, which hit its lowest level since late January, last week undercut a buy point and a 50-day line as media stocks sold off on cable advertising and pay-TV subscription declines.But how investors should play the House of Mouse might be a matter of perspective.On the call, Disney chief Bob Iger was forced, yet again, to vigorously defend the cable channel — perhaps not without reason, as CFO Christine McCarthy noted during the call ""a slight change"" in the rate of cable subscription losses.""The magnitude of the change was less than half a point compared to what we experienced during the first quarter,"" she said.In other words: subscriber losses accelerated slightly from the previous quarter.ESPN gets put under the microscope because its broader segment, media networks, accounts for well over 40% of Disney's revenue, more than the company's studio, theme parks or consumer products units, and the network has long been seen as a cash cow. Meanwhile, the movie business can be risky.But things have changed. A slow-growth ESPN and high-power studio and theme parks segments might be the new normal, argues one analyst. And that's OK.IBD'S TAKE: Missed the call? Here are the highlights: Disney CEO Iger On ESPN: 'We're Not Sitting On Our Hands'Historically, Disney has been viewed as a ""high-multiple Media Networks business and a lower multiple, less predictable Studio + Parks business,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets' Steven Cahall. The current iteration of the media conglomerate ""turns this on its head with much better predictability (and upside) from Parks + Studio and a recognition that ESPN is good for cash, but not a growth driver.""Indeed, Disney's studio arm seems unstoppable, with its combination of Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, all of which seem to consistently churn out hits. Two movies in fiscal 2017 have already raked in over $1 billion at the box office (""Rogue One"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""), and Iger told analysts on the call that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2"" is the 15th straight Marvel title to open at No. 1.RBC has an outperform rating and 130 price target on the stock.""Liking (Disney) in spite of ESPN is still a relatively new concept, but we think the assets and growth justify our view,"" said Cahall.Piper Jaffray's Stan Meyers offered up a similar sentiment.""We continue to believe Disney's (intellectual property) will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN,"" wrote Meyers, adding that Disney is in a plum spot in a fragmented media industry.He has an overweight rating and 130 price target on Disney as well.And according to Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar, who has an equal weight rating on Disney: ""Over the course of the next year, while it is tough to believe that underlying trends at ESPN would inflect in any way, we believe the upcoming affiliate renewal cycle, the company's box office slate and continued margin expansion at theme parks could provide a good floor to the stock.""Still, not everyone was an optimist. BMO Capital's Daniel Salmon reaffirmed his underperform rating, despite the studios and theme parks' performance, highlighting ESPN's challenges in the digital age.

163,FOXA,"X Not long after the Federal Communications Commission loosened its cap on how many stations one company can own, Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) announced early Monday that it is acquiring Tribune Media (TRCO) for $43.50 a share for an aggregate purchase price of about $3.9 billion, in addition to the assumption of $2.7 billion in net debt, said the companies in a statement.That brings into the Sinclair fold Tribune Media's 42 television stations across 33 markets, WGN America and other properties.Calling the Tribune stations ""highly complementary"" to Sinclair's current properties, the acquisition ""will enable Sinclair to build ATSC 3.0 (Next Generation Broadcast Platform) advanced services, scale emerging networks and national sales, and integrate content verticals,"" said Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley in a statement.""The acquisition will also create substantial synergistic value through operating efficiencies, revenue streams, programming strategies and digital platforms.""The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.Sinclair shares initially spiked to 41.15, but reversed to trade down 2.2% at 36.13 in the stock market today. Tribune Media shares rose 5.2% to 42.38.This follow's last week's reports that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Blackstone (BX) were considering a joint bid to acquire Tribune Media.

164,FOXA,"X Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIAB), Comcast (CMCSA) and other big companies sold off on cable advertising concerns. Meanwhile, Hulu, the streaming platform jointly backed by four major media conglomerates, has officially entered the live-television fray with a more-than-50-channel bundle, priced at $39.99 a month.Time Warner (TWX) said Wednesday that advertising revenue fell 2% in the first quarter vs. a year earlier, with declines continuing the quarter. Comcast said last week that its NBCUniversal ad revenue fell in Q1. Pay-TV operators suffered big subscriber losses in Q1 as well.CBS tumbled 3.35% on the stock market today. Disney lost 2.4%, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Viacom reversed sharply to sink 7.5%, below its 200-day line. Fox sold off 5.1%. Comcast sank 2%, closing just below a buy point cleared after reporting earnings. Dish Network (DISH) fell 4.4% and Charter Communications (CHTR) 3.9%, both undercutting their 50-day lines. Time Warner, which is being acquired by AT&T (T), dipped 0.3%. AT&T slid 1.4% to a five-month low.Meanwhile, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins announced the live-TV service's beta launch at its annual upfronts presentation Wednesday, calling it a ""natural extension of our business.""Disney, Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner all have a stake in Hulu, which explains its fairly comprehensive channel offerings, such as ABC, NBC, Fox, E!, Bravo, USA, TBS, CNN and CNBC. The service also includes access to the platform's streaming library.Live sports stations are also part of the basket. The live service includes NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports channels, TNT and a number of different ESPN stations.Like rival products from Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's Sling TV, Hulu's package isn't all-encompassing, although it does include CBS (CBS), which has been building out its own over-the-top streaming presence through CBS All Access.As Vulture points out, the Hulu bundle lacks AMC Networks (AMCX) channels and Viacom-owned MTV, Comedy Central and VH1.For comparison, Vue's comparably priced $39.99-a-month Access tier, the most basic of four levels, offers around 45 channels. (Its high-end $74.99-a-month Ultra level includes 90 channels, including HBO and Showtime.) Sling's $25 monthly Blue-level subscription includes 45 channels but no CBS or ESPN.Hulu's service includes 50 hours of recorded storage, but 200 more hours in ""enhanced cloud DVR"" will run subscribers an extra $14.99 a month. Vue offers unlimited cloud DVR storage for 28 days. YouTube TV, from Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, has launched a $35-a-month service in several major cities with no cloud storage limits either.Both CBS and Viacom report quarterly results Thursday.

166,FOXA,"It's business as usual on Wall Street, with big media stocks unfazed Tuesday, but writers and studios narrowly came to a contract agreement in the wee hours, preventing a major work stoppage in Hollywood that would've impacted the industry that Walt Disney (DIS), CBS (CBS) and others call home.Both sides came to a truce shortly after midnight, when the current contract expired, reported Variety.According to a statement posted on the Writers Guild of America site, negotiators were ""pleased to report that we have reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP that we can recommend for ratification.""Disney shares dipped 0.3% in the stock market today. CBS sank 1.5%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) rose 0.1%. Viacom (VIAB) fell 0.3%.Among the gains were health plan contributions ""that should ensure its solvency for years to come,"" and job protection for parental leave, it said. Pay-TV residuals were bumped up by 15% and options and exclusivity protections were expanded.The agreement, according to the memo, also help put to bed an issue spurred by the trend toward shorter seasons, such as those favored by Netflix (NFLX): now, episodic fees are worth 2.4 weeks of work, and overtime must be paid. A key TV writers' complaint going into the talks was that shorter seasons translated to less pay for the same amount of work, since Guild members are paid per episode.The last strike, which lasted 100 days in 2007 through early 2008, punished the industry to the tune of $2.1 billion, according to the Milken Institute.This time around, the addition of Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) to the mix means that a work stoppage could have accelerated a shift to digital platforms, said Barclays analysts last month.""While Netflix and Amazon's pipelines are also likely to be affected by the writers' strike, their library of original content could realize much wider viewership in the absence of competition from legacy TV,"" wrote Barclays analysts Ross Sandler and Kannan Venkateshwar on April 12. ""These companies also have the ability to source content globally, as evidenced by the number of British shows on Netflix.""Netflix edged up 0.&% while Amazon dipped 0.1% after both surged to record highs on Monday.Moody's said Monday that a strike would have weighed on media companies that need studio content to survive.""Most at risk if there is a protracted strike would be movie theater companies, followed by broadcast television networks and premium pay-TV channels, especially companies that are highly leveraged or weakly positioned relative to their existing credit ratings,"" said Moody's Senior Vice President Neil Begley in a Monday note.""Least at risk would be major studios and broadcasters that are well-diversified and have relatively strong balance sheets.""RELATED:Who Is Most At Risk If Hollywood's Writers Strike Tuesday?Why Netflix, Facebook, Amazon Could Flourish If Hollywood's Writers Strike

167,FOXA,"XJust hours remain before a writers' strike could begin, shutting down the TV and film industry, traditional media stocks weren't reacting much so far Monday. Given the forecasts for long-term repercussions, however, should investors be taking more notice?The Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios left talks on Sunday with ""cautious optimism,"" according to Variety, as both sides edge closer to agreement on key points. The current contract expires at midnight, meaning that a work stoppage would begin on Tuesday.The last strike, which lasted for 100 days from November 2007 through February 2008, slammed the entertainment industry by $2.1 billion, according to a Milken Institute report.Moody's analysts said that in the event of another three-month-or-longer stoppage, ""weaker media companies with limited financial flexibility could see their credit standing suffer.""A shorter strike would not ""seriously"" impact revenue and cash flow, wrote Moody's Senior Vice President Neil Begley in a Monday note. But a five-month strike or longer, could be ""bothersome — and even dire, in some cases"" for media companies that need studio content to survive.""Most at risk if there is a protracted strike would be movie theater companies, followed by broadcast television networks and premium pay-TV channels, especially companies that are highly leveraged or weakly positioned relative to their existing credit ratings,"" said Begley.""Least at risk would be major studios and broadcasters that are well-diversified and have relatively strong balance sheets.""Walt Disney (DIS) shares dipped 0.7% in the stock market today. CBS (CBS) rose 0.1%. NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) was unchanged 21st Century Fox (FOXA) retreated 0.5%. Disney and Comcast are in buy range, while CBS is just below a proper entry area.At the heart of negotiations are the funding of the WGA health plan, as well as writers' residuals and compensation structure. Writers say that shorter seasons, a la those favored by the likes of Netflix (NFLX), have meant less pay for the same work time frames, since they are compensated per episode.""Residuals formulas are also different across windows and writers are getting a lower share with the decline of traditional syndication and the rise of (video on demand) and (subscription video on demand) services like Netflix,"" wrote Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar, who spoke on Friday with the WGA's Chris Keyser and Charles Slocum.Netflix shares rose 2.1% to 155.35, hitting a new all-time high. Amazon (AMZN), another streaming video contender that has shaken up the entertainment landscape since the last WGA strike in 2007-2008, rallied 2.5% to 948.43, rising intraday above Friday's record best.IBD's TAKE: Here's a more in-depth look at why Netflix, Amazon and even Facebook could flourish, should Hollywood's writers go on strike Tuesday.The availability of on-demand content online could mean that a strike — which would hobble the fall TV season — would push even more viewers to platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and others, said Barclays in April. The timing of a possible strike would also muck up the May upfronts season, a key period for media networks and advertisers.""While it is likely premature to determine the impact, we believe given the proliferation of content and (over-the-top) platform and online advertising alternatives, the impact of a drawn-out strike this time around could last longer than the 2007 strike,"" said Venkateshwar in Monday's note.RELATED:If You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, Facebook

169,FOXA,"X Maybe honesty isn't always the best policy? Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger slogged through an array of ESPN-related questions on late Tuesday's earnings call after the sports cable giant logged another quarter of subscriber declines. His bullish reaffirmations hearkened back to calls of earnings past, after he first disclosed in August 2015 that ESPN had sustained subscriber losses.""Give us a little bit of credit for being very candid with you on an earnings call two summers ago,"" he told analysts, asserting that ""we had our eyes wide open"" about ESPN's issues, which allowed the company to deal with them head-on.Disney shares fell in late trade after ending Tuesday's regular session up 0.6% to 112.07 on the stock market today.Overall, Disney turned in a mixed quarter, falling short of second-quarter revenue forecasts late Tuesday with 3% growth to $13.34 billion. Profit of $1.50 per share marked a 10% year-over-year gain, ahead of estimates for 4% EPS growth.The entertainment heavyweight's media networks revenue, which includes both broadcast and cable TV, rose 3%, while operating income fell 3%. Programming costs also weighed on ESPN; cable networks' operating income fell 3%. The Disney Channels and Freeform, which appeal to children, teens and young adults, also lost subscribers during that period.Iger has his eyes on the future, as more people get their sports scores and highlights from mobile devices.While ""there's nothing we can really do to slow that down,"" he said it's important for the network to participate in the new wave of technology. That's translated to development of ESPN's apps, its upcoming streaming platform powered by BAMTech and the network's presence on over-the-top ""skinny"" bundles, which Iger says benefit from the inclusion of ESPN.""They've concluded that launching without ESPN is very challenged,"" he said on the call, adding, however, that despite ""really nice growth,"" subscriber growth on streaming platforms has not made up for traditional cable-package subscriber losses.ESPN found itself in the headlines late last month when it laid off around 100 on-air personalities, another reminder of the troubles facing the traditional pay TV landscape.""We're not sitting on our hands,"" said Iger.Disney's TV woes aside, Iger predictably lauded the studio's many box office successes, calling attention to ""Rogue One"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" each of which have brought in at least $1 billion globally.Still, theatrical results were only ""comparable"" to the prior-year quarter due to the strength of ""The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" in 2016, according to the earnings release. Studio revenue dipped 1%, while operating income grew 21%.The theme parks segment logged the greatest revenue growth, up 9%. Operating income grew 20%, thanks to higher attendance and more spending on food and drink.Lastly, revenue at Disney's consumer products and interactive media unit dropped 11%, as strong ""Frozen"" and ""Star Wars"" sales last year provided tough comparisons. Operating income grew 3%.Up until last week, shares had been on a fairly steady upward march, making their way back up to 2015 highs. But Disney tumbled last week, falling below a buy point and its 50-day moving average.That was part of a broader media stock sell-off, spurred by sector jitters about ad revenue and subscriber losses following quarterly results from Viacom (VIAB), Time Warner (TWX) and others, plus the introduction of Hulu's live-TV beta service. (Disney is a joint owner of Hulu.)Broadly, investors appear to remain nervous about the power of cord-cutting and the state of the traditional pay TV system.During the session, Viacom fell 0.5%, while Time Warner sank 0.3%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA), which will report earnings on Wednesday, dipped 0.6%.Discovery Communications' (DISCA) results Tuesday revealed a ""slight decline"" in subscribers in its U.S. networks segment. Discovery shares retreated 2.2%.RELATED:Disney Earnings Preview: Movie Magic Vs. TV Static
"
170,FOXA,"Ahead of its earnings report, Walt Disney's (DIS) quarterly story remains something of a split personality, as its studio segment boasts more hits but its media networks unit — notably ESPN — encounters obstacles.Questions over its recent talent bloodletting at the sports cable network will now likely add to by-now-routine scrutiny over its subscriber figures when the media conglomerate reports after the close Tuesday.For Disney's fiscal second quarter, Street analysts are looking for profit and revenue growth of 4% to $1.41 a share and $13.45 billion, respectively.Late last month, ESPN laid off about 100 of its on-air talent, as network chief John Skipper said that the network navigates ""changes in technology and fan behavior."" Subscriber loss concerns continue to dog the network.A shift in viewership habits and the proliferation of online platforms have, over the years, hit media companies where it hurts: paid subscriptions and advertising revenue.Last week, HBO and Warner Bros. parent Time Warner (TWX) reported a decline in advertising revenue at its Turner network, while Viacom (VIAB) shares dove, despite a beat, amid concerns that its flagships channels were losing ground in distribution.Notably, ""three of four biggest weekly sell-offs in media in the last decade have happened in the last three years, which shows the degree of uncertainty that has crept into the sector,"" wrote Barclays media analyst Kannan Venkateshwar.Additionally: Hulu, of which Disney is a joint owner, launched on Wednesday a live-TV beta service that promises around 50 channels for $39.99 a month, adding to the fray of over-the-top ""skinny"" bundle providers that includes Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue.21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.Disney shares fell 0.5% to 111.42 on Monday, still below a 112.09 buy point after undercutting that level last week. Viacom slipped 1.1% after diving 13.5% last week. Fox dropped 2.5% Monday, on top of its 4.6% weekly loss.IBD's TAKE: It's not all doom and gloom for media companies in the subscriber wars. There's one — perhaps surprising — media company that is still adding accounts while others bleed subscriptions.Disney's media networks unit makes up the bulk of total revenue — over 42% in the December-ended quarter — which is why ESPN alone receives so much attention. And the strength of the legacy sports news brand may not carry as much weight in the future.""In every evolution of OTT, the number of clicks needs to get to a program guide or a network viewing option is actually increasing,"" said Venkateshwar in his broad note on U.S. media. ""Given the importance of consumer inertia in usage patterns, this is not a trivial shift.""The interface of streaming platforms also means that coverage is divvied up by content and not by network, he added.""Instead, the default interface is organized by sport and/or teams... . As a result, it is tough to see the brands of individual networks retaining any value in the coming years,"" wrote Venkateshwar.But Disney still has some tricks up its sleeve.ESPN and BAMTech are slated to launch a direct-to-consumer sports streaming service ""probably"" this calendar year, said CEO Bob Iger in the company's most recent earnings call, though it is designed to be a supplement — and not a replacement — to the main ESPN network. Disney has a one-third stake in streaming technology firm BAMTech.And massive hits for Disney's studio segment as well as optimistic projections for its movie pipeline, which is packed with ""Star Wars,"" Marvel and Pixar films, have some analysts staying bullish.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has so far earned over $427.6 million globally, debuting domestically this past weekend with a $145 million haul, according to Box Office Mojo. And Disney's March release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" remains the U.S. box office leader in 2017 with $487.6 million domestically, for a total of $1.19 billion worldwide.""We continue to be buyers of Disney as we believe the robust film slate will continue to broaden the company's moat and drive significant value across key segments,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers on Sunday. He has an overweight rating on the stock.RELATED:Viacom Tries To Calm Fears Its Channels Are Losing DistributionBig Media Stocks Unfazed Even As Hollywood Came To Brink Of StoppageIf You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, FacebookESPN On-Air-Talent Layoffs Double What Was Expected

AT&T could not be reached for comment.It's not clear if AT&T would offer free Apple TV hardware with full functionality that would enable users to get programming from other sources, says Joel Espelien, an analyst at the Diffusion Group.""To Apple, this is just another app running on their box, it does not really help their TV ecosystem,"" Espelien said. ""It's not at all clear to me that AT&T will support the Apple 'TV app' search functionality.""IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock, along with Verizon Communications, were top performers in the first half of 2016 owing to their dividends. Apple, IBM and Cisco Systems are other companies that are increasing shareholder returns. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor. Fire TV sticks start at $40 while Apple TV costs around $150.AT&T has teased a $35 price point for the DirecTV service. It's not clear, however, if that's a discounted price for customers that buy both the online video service and wireless services.While 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and NBC Universal have joined AT&T's programming line-up, there are other unknowns that will determine how big a threat DirecTV Now could be to cable firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), said Bryan Kraft, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a research report.""We don't yet know if the $35 tier is an entry-level 100-plus channel tier with lots of filler channels, or if it is the flagship tier with 100-plus real channels,"" said Kraft. ""If it is the former, then it's probably not that big a deal. However, if it is the latter, then it would appear that AT&T is using the service to show regulators its pro-consumer side, which is not good for cable.""That said, we think this is a manageable headwind.""If AT&T's DirecTV Now is a big success, it could pressure Comcast and Charter to acquire a wireless firm such as T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS), some analysts have speculated.CBS, which offers its own stand-alone streaming service, has not announced a deal with AT&T.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), though, in October signed CBS as a partner for its ""Unplugged""-branded service.

173,FOXA,"When Walt Disney (DIS) reports fourth-quarter and year-end earnings late Thursday, it wouldn't be a stretch to expect more of the same: horn-tooting about the studio's hits, some nice words about the new theme park in Shanghai, and a vigorous defense of ESPN's health.Earnings are expected to dip 3% to $1.16 a share on flattish revenue growth to $13.52 billion.But expect ESPN to be in focus in the wake of Disney's data fight with Nielsen last week, in which the ratings company estimated that the sports network lost 621,000 subscribers in just one month. ESPN disputed the figures, but after pulling and double-checking its data, Nielsen reaffirmed Friday that its ""estimates were accurate as originally released.""ESPN reportedly called the figures a ""historic anomaly.""Either way, that will likely bring ESPN back to the forefront of Thursday's conference call, more than a year after CEO Bob Iger's comments about a modest subscriber decline at the cable network spurred a nervous breakdown across the media sector.Disney shares have yet to retake their all-time high of 122.08, reached on Aug. 4, 2015, the day Iger made those remarks during an earnings call.Separately, Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil estimates that ESPN  is ""at least 3 to 4 (million) subscribers lower than expectations heading into the new NBA contract from the time they signed it"" two years ago.Shares of Disney closed up 2.1% to 94.43 on the stock market today amid a broad market rally. Peer Time Warner (TWX) — which recently agreed to be acquired by AT&T (T) — rose 1.5% to finish at 87.74, and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), which reported an increase in cable subscribers last week, added 1.7% to 27.39.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, bandied about as a potential — but unlikely — acquiree of Disney, has been plunking down a pretty penny for original content. Here's how that is impacting its perception on Wall Street: ""Netflix: Still A Hot Tech Play Or A Media Stock That Acts Like Tech?""While the media-networks segment has traditionally been Disney's biggest moneymaker, the studio arm continues to blaze a hot trail, led by a string of Marvel successes and a seemingly never-ending pipeline of ""Star Wars"" films.Marvel's ""Doctor Strange"" brought in $84.9 million at the domestic box office on opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo, with a global gross of over $325 million so far. That, along with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" should make for a solid start to Disney's new fiscal year, although some analysts see a tough comparison to ""The Force Awakens""' epic box-office haul last year.In focus for Thursday's Q4 report, however, should be ""Finding Dory,"" the Pixar sequel to ""Finding Nemo."" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers expects the movie to help drive studio revenue up 10% for the quarter.In contrast to the analysts concerned about ESPN, Cowen's Doug Creutz offers up a different worry: that the House of Mouse is ""earning an unsustainable portion of film industry profits (over 60% of the total in the first half of 2016), at a time when industry profits are under pressure.""RELATED:Election, Nvidia, Disney, Acacia Dominate Investing Action PlanTime Warner Shrugs Off Low AT&T Breakup Fee, Merger NaysayersMedia Chatter: Tronc Dumped, N.Y.

Amazon said it will launch ""The Grand Tour,"" an Amazon original series, worldwide in December. Starting Friday, the series will launch in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia and Japan.Netflix airs in some 190 countries, with China the only major holdout.Amazon did not issue a press release announcing the global expansion, leaving that role to CEO Jeff Bezos in a tweet.Long wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald in a research note estimated that the launch of a global video streaming service by Amazon would require an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in video content spending in 2017. That would bring Amazon's annual content expenditure in line with Netflix, at about $6 billion for 2017, Fitzgerald wrote. The $6 billion is up from an estimated $4.5 billion Amazon will spend this year, he estimates.""Three weeks ago Amazon reported a mixed quarter with solid top line performance and soft margins; margin guidance disappointed too. Now we know where a major piece of incremental investment might be going to — digital content for Amazon Video,"" Fitzgerald wrote.Amazon missed the consensus estimate on earnings per share by a wide margin when it reported third quarter earnings Oct. 27, while its profit guidance for Q4 also fell short. The main reason for the earnings miss was larger-than-expected investments in video content, Amazon Web Services and an expansion of fulfillment centers.""Considering the fact that in general Amazon makes announcements of strategic initiatives only after the bulk of the necessary assets are already in place, we believe that the company has more or less secured the global rights for a core streaming video offering,"" Fitzgerald wrote.Amazon's global rollout begins with ""The Grand Tour"" and is expected to expand rapidly into new markets.Netflix, in addition to the increased competition from Amazon is confronting a more aggressive Hulu, which plans to launch a live streaming TV service in 2017, in addition to its original and third-party content. Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS), NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX).Jefferies analyst John Janedis, in a research note on Netflix, said Amazon appears to be aggressively securing digital rights for content in India, much more so than Netflix. In India,  Amazon has been developing relationships with local talent and has started making investments in high quality content, je wrote. Janedis has an underperform rating on Amazon and price target of 80. Fitzgerald has a buy rating on Amazon and price target of 950.Amazon stock rose 0.50% to 760.16 in the stock market today. Netflix stock rose a small fraction to 115.21.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon fell past its 50-day moving average in big volume on Oct. 28, a sell signal, in reaction to a disappointing third-quarter earnings report. With a big jump over the past two years, Amazon shares took up residence on IBD Leaderboard, an exclusive list of the very top stocks near or at buy points. But the stock Leaders can change fast.

He then told the Post that he remained focused on ""win(ning) the presidency.""But the most recent polls have shown Hillary Clinton to have anywhere from a 4-point to 11-point lead in the wake of the sexual assault allegations against Trump, an issue that has prompted numerous GOP lawmakers to withdraw their support for the Republican presidential nominee.It is unclear exactly when Kushner's conversation with Bourkoff took place.A theoretical Trump network could potentially siphon away viewers of Fox News, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Fox News also has a sister channel, Fox Business Channel.While the Financial Times points out that squeezing another channel into a cable package would be difficult, Recode imagines it as an over-the-top service, calling a Trump channel ""one that could rival or even supplant Fox News.""For better or for worse, the Trump campaign has easily dominated the daily and weekly news cycle, without the help of the right-leaning cable news network.Fox News' recent problems have not been a secret: Ailes was ousted in July following sexual harassment accusations from women at the network.Perhaps more pressingly, Megyn Kelly — Fox News' star — is reportedly waffling on whether she will choose to renew her network contract, which expires in July 2017. Then there's the well-publicized talk of rivalries between Kelly and Sean Hannity, as well as between her and Bill O'Reilly.Trump, meanwhile, has been steadily welcoming high-profile populist conservative media into the fold throughout the summer.

179,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX) countersued 21st Century Fox (FOXA) in an employment dispute on Wednesday, accusing the media giant of imposing a ""involuntary servitude"" on its workers.Fox on Sept. 16 had sued streaming giant Netflix after the streaming giant hired away two key executives. Fox claimed Netflix willfully disregarded contractual agreements with its employees.Netflix is aggressively expanding into creating its own content and grabbing key talent from media entertainment companies. Media giants such Fox, Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner (TWX) and Comcast (CMCSA) are struggling to adapt to streaming media. That includes uneasy cooperation and conflict with Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video. Hulu is owned by Disney, Time Warner, Comcast and Fox.At the time, Netflix said it would fight back hard. On Wednesday, Netflix said it would look to hire more Fox employees and urged courts to declare Fox employment contracts unenforceable.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix has soared following its late Monday earnings report. But two other FANG stocks have also retaken buy points.Netflix noted in its California Superior Court filing that the state prizes employee mobility and enshrines it in public policy, statute, and case law.""It added that Fox is bullying its workers with ""take it or leave it"" deals that unlawfully restrict employees and rivals.""Through its widespread use of unlawful restrictive fixed-term employment agreements, Fox is facilitating and enforcing a system that restrains employee mobility, depresses compensation levels, and creates unlawful barriers to entry for Netflix and others competing in the film and television production business,"" Netflix said.Netflix shares rose 2.6% to 121.87 on the stock market today after surging 19% Tuesday following its strong Q3 earnings and subscriber gains announced late Monday.21st Century Fox shares rose 16 cents to 25.12, after retaking its 50-day line for the first time in four months on Monday.RELATED:5 Takeaways From Netflix Earnings Surprise, Stock SurgeNetflix Sued For Nicking Fox Execs But Claims 'Employee Mobility'

The NBA extended its deals with ESPN (owned by Disney (DIS)) and TNT, giving Turner Sports a dozen extra games in the regular season.Martin said Turner is launching a Monday night NBA franchise as a result of the extra games.""In the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started, with what ratings look like, and inventory has been extremely tight and there's been huge demand for our NBA properties, so I feel really good about advertising going into next year,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T is acquiring Time Warner to the tune of $85.4 billion. Despite investor doubts about the regulatory hurdles it will have to face, Time Warner execs expressed confidence Wednesday that the deal is going to get done.Meanwhile, the NFL is making a good-faith effort to reach more eyeballs, namely through its partnership with Twitter (TWTR) to stream Thursday night games on the social network.Shares of Time Warner fell 1.1% to 87.28 in the stock market today.

181,FOXA,"The Obama administration's Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit Wednesday against AT&T (T), charging that its DirecTV business engaged in unlawful information-sharing with other pay TV operators amid former Time Warner Cable's efforts to seek carriage fees for a Los Angles-area sports network carrying Dodgers baseball games.The DOJ filing comes 10 days after AT&T announced its proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), which analysts say faces regulatory hurdles. AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV in 2015.""We respect the DOJ's important role in protecting consumers, but in this case, which occurred before AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV, we see the facts differently,"" said David McAtee, AT&T general counsel, in a statement.  ""The reason why no other major TV provider chose to carry this content was that no one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that Time Warner Cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to L.A. Dodgers baseball.""We make our carriage decisions independently, legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner.""Charter Communications (CHTR) acquired Time Warner Cable in 2015. TWC spent over $7 billion in 2013 to acquire rights to Dodger games, beating out Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (FOXA).IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock has shed 16% since Oct. 1 amid speculation over rising interest rates and reaction to the Time Warner takeover bid. Look for news about other dividend paying stocks at The Income Investor.In 2011, Time Warner Cable had doled out an estimated $3 billion for rights to L.A. Lakers basketball games.Time Warner launched a L.A. sports network in 2014. Many pay TV providers claimed carriage fees sought by Time Warner Cable were too high, and did not carry the Dodgers channel.The Justice Department lawsuit alleges that DirecTV was the ""ringleader"" of an effort involving then rival AT&T as well as Cox Communications and Charter to undermine negotiations with Time Warner Cable.Federal regulators blocked Comcast's (CMCSA) proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable in 2015.AT&T stock edged down a fraction in the stock market today to 36.37.RELATED:AT&T CEO On Time Warner Deal: Aiming To Set Pace In Innovation

182,FOXA,"The deal is going to get done. At least, that's the sentiment over at Time Warner (TWX), which, unlike many on Wall Street and elsewhere, doesn't believe its acquisition by AT&T (T) is going to succumb to regulatory troubles.In response to an analyst who pointed out that AT&T's share of the breakup fee -- $500 million — seems low, CEO Jeff Bewkes dismissed the concern.""We want to get this done,"" he said Wednesday morning, after the HBO and Warner Bros. Studios parents reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and bumped up its full-year guidance.""We think the combined company (is going to have) competition-spurring advantages and more choice,"" said Bewkes in a call with analysts. Both companies have made ""significant commitments"" to pass regulatory muster and therefore ""don't think it's very important what the size of the fee is.""Time Warner's general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, called the merger ""plainly pro-competitive,"" adding that there's still competition at both levels of the vertical deal.The $107.50-a-share cash-and-stock deal is worth $85.4 billion, bringing HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. Studios under the wing of the telecommunications heavyweight. It is expected to close by the end of 2017.Despite the size of the transaction, Time Warner didn't allude to any major changes happening anytime soon.For instance, Bewkes said he anticipates ""no change"" to its involvement with Hulu, in which it has a passive 10% investment. Hulu is jointly owned by Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Time Warner.""We don't think the merger here changes anything,"" he said, adding that is generally true of all of its deals with other distribution packages.Time Warner also noted that the Tencent (TCEHY) video service that it is a part of is now the No. 2 subscription video on demand service in China.Q3 EPS jumped 46% to $1.83, easily topping forecasts for $1.37, as revenue grew 9% to $7.17 billion, above views for $6.98 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $5.45-$5.55, above consensus views for $5.43 and up from a prior outlook of $5.35-$5.45.Shares were down 1.1% to close at 87.28 on the stock market today, as market skepticism that the merger will be realized continues to keep the stock below AT&T's bid price.IBD'S TAKE: Is Netflix still a tech company or a media company? The answer to that question may affect any price tag for Netflix as the two sectors converge.Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox is slated to disclose results later in the day. Analysts see EPS up 16% to 44 cents on 7% revenue growth to $6.49 billion.M&A is on the brain across the board in media, and Stifel continues to expect that Fox will be less focused on near-term capital return in favor of M&A and organic investments such as Hulu.""While a less targeted capital return policy has weighed on the stock, given earlier tight capital return targets, we believe there is increased interest on the part of the company for a buyout of the share they don't own of BSkyB both because of its accretion, but also the diversification away from US advertising,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil on Oct. 13.RELATED:Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCUApple Encouraged To Bid For Time Warner As TV Strategy FaltersDisney-Netflix Deal?

192,FOXA,"AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have more incentive to launch or expand nationwide internet TV services in the wake of Congress's repeal of data privacy rules, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.Lawmakers voted March 30 to overturn Federal Communication Commission rules that would have required Internet service providers to get customers permission before collecting data on web-browsing and app usage. A Democratic-led FCC had approved tougher data privacy rules in mid-2016.Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR), AT&T and Verizon are the biggest internet providers. Pacific Crest Securities says internet providers will be better-positioned for targeted advertising, much like internet companies.""The ability to collect data could compel (internet providers), particularly AT&T and Verizon, to more aggressively push their (video streaming) efforts in the hope of capturing more consumer share, which would create more opportunities to sell targeted 30-second video ads,"" Andy Hargreaves, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a note to clients.Verizon is readying a new video streaming service, Bloomberg reported last week. Comcast has reportedly acquired rights from cable network owners to offer their channels nationwide.

195,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms are becoming broadband-first companies as they take away internet customers of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).The top cable companies added 3.3 million broadband subscribers in 2016 — similar to the gains in 2015, and the most net additions in any year since 2007, says Leichtman Research Group. Cable TV firms, meanwhile, lost 278,000 pay-TV video subscribers in 2016, although Comcast added 161,000.Comcast had 24.7 million broadband subscribers vs. 22.5 million video customers at the end of 2016. The broadband gap is wider at Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable. Charter had 22.59 million broadband subscribers vs. 17.2 million video subscribers as of Dec. 31.The top cable TV firms followed by LRG had 58.4 million broadband subscribers vs. 48.6 million video subscribers at the end of 2016. Top telephone companies — including AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink (CTL) — had 34.5 million broadband subscribers, down 599,000 from a year earlier. In 2015, phone companies lost 185,000 broadband subscribers, says LRG.With more internet video services rolling out in 2017 and next year, pay-TV industry subscribers could fall further, analysts say. As cord-cutting goes on and the traditional video business for cable providers shrinks, their No. 1 product will be broadband and internet access. So even if internet video takes off, they still have broadband dominance.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

196,FOXA,"AT&T (T) will sell a 100 channel-plus video-streaming service branded ""DirecTV Now"" starting at $35 monthly, its CEO Randall Stephenson said at a conference on Tuesday. Programming may not include much content from CBS (CBS) or 21st Century Fox (FOXA), based on earlier reports.AT&T's $35 price-tag is about $15 below estimates by Wall Street analysts.AT&T's pricing could impact the strategies of Hulu, which is expected to launch a live-streaming TV service in early 2017, as well as Amazon.com (AMZN). Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA).AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services. Like other providers of so-called OTT (over-the-top) services, AT&T will not bear distribution costs, including network transport or set-top boxes.At $35 a month, AT&T's package might not include sports channels such as Disney's ESPN.IBD's TAKE: AT&T stock has dropped nearly 7% since reports of the Time Warner deal surfaced and subsequently announced. Time Warner stock is trading at near 87, roughly 20 below AT&T's cash and stock offer of 107.50 per share. Analysts say TWX shareholders may be unsure of regulatory approval. Analysts do not expect another bidder such as Walt Disney or Apple to swoop in for TWX. Media stocks have cooled off since Friday. Learn more about CBS and other media stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.Stephenson, while announcing AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner (TWX) on Monday, disclosed that DirecTV Now would be launched in November. Time Warner owns a 10% stake in Hulu.AT&T acquired satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group in 2015.""We estimate monthly programming costs for DirecTV Now in the low $30 range, similar to the price AT&T will charge, meaning the company will not make much on this service,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research report. ""However, it will avoid costs for satellites, set-top boxes and installations/trouble-shooting, while also reaching customers who have left the pay TV market or never joined.""Strong growth in this product would support AT&T's vision for the TWX transaction and likely sit well with regulators concerned about the OTT ecosystem.""

198,FOXA,"AT&T (T) has reached a deal to acquire Time Warner (TWX) for $107.50 a share, with an equity value of $85.4 billion, the two companies announced Saturday evening. But the merger faces major regulatory and political hurdles.The equal parts cash-and-stock acquisition, worth $108.7 billion including assumed debt, brings the parent company of HBO, CNN and Warner Bro. Studios under the umbrella of the telecommunications giant.""Premium content always wins. It has been true on the big screen, the TV screen and now it's proving true on the mobile screen,"" AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson said in a statement. ""We'll have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen.""The big merger is not the first in recent memory for AT&T, which acquired satellite provider DirecTV last year for nearly $50 billion.Nor is it an unusual trend: Comcast (CMCSA) fully acquired NBCUniversal three years ago, and Verizon Communications (VZ) -Yahoo (YHOO) deal is currently in the works. Sumner Redstone's National Amusements is pushing CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) to reunite.Even Apple (AAPL) reportedly approached Time Warner about a merger several months ago, said the Wall Street Journal.IBD'S TAKE: As internet giants such Alphabet's Google add video content and launch services, AT&T and others are being pushed to gain more content.Time Warner turned down an $85-per-share offer from 21st Century Fox (FOXA) two years ago.But in a stump speech on Saturday, Donald Trump opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger, saying that if he wins the White House, the deal will not be approved. ""Deals like this destroy democracy,"" the Republican nominee said, who vowed to go after the media ""power structure"" that he claims is opposing his presidential run.Whoever is in the White House, antitrust regulators likely would take a long look at the deal, with approval not certain.A combined AT&T-Time Warner would have a market cap around $300 billion. That's roughly equal to Comcast ($154 billion) and Walt Disney (DIS) ($150 billion) together.Separately, AT&T announced third-quarter results, ahead of Tuesday's scheduled release. AT&T earned 74 cents a share excluding various items, flat vs. a year earlier and meeting analyst estimates. Revenue, including DirecTV, climbed 4.6% to $40.9 billion, slightly below views.AT&T added 212,000 monthly wireless customers, slightly better than some forecasts.DirecTV added 323,000 customers, while AT&T added a net 171,000 broadband subscribers.AT&T said it's on track to meet or beat full-year targets. It also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents a share.It'll hold a webcast on Monday morning to discuss the Time Warner deal and its Q3 earnings.Shares of Time Warner closed up 7.8% on Friday to 89.48. AT&T shares fell 3% to 37.49.

199,FOXA,"What's behind AT&T's (T) apparent pursuit of media giant Time Warner (TWX)? AT&T craves rights to more content, as internet giants such as Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and possibly Apple (AAPL) push into web TV and entertainment services, analysts say.Telecom conglomerate AT&T reportedly is nearing a cash-and-stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner, with an announcement possible as soon as this weekend or Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported. Media and entertainment stocks jumped Friday on views that internet, telecom and media companies will scramble to acquire content.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN. Time Warner owns a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu, a joint venture of Comcast (CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS).AT&T stock fell 3% to 37.49 in the stock market today on the WSJ report, the lowest since the end of February. Time Warner stock jumped 7.8% to 89.48.But after the close, AT&T fell about 1% while Time Warner popped 4%. Bloomberg reported that AT&T is near a deal to buy Time Warner for $110 a share.During the regular session,  Discovery Communications (DISCA), controlled by media baron John Malone, popped 3.6%, while CBS stock rose 1.9% and Walt Disney 1.1%.Shares of 21st Century Fox, which bid for Time Warner in 2014, rose 2.2%, Viacom (VIA) 2.7%, Scripps Interactive (SNI) 5.6% and AMC Networks (AMCX) 3.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Media consolidation has been expected, with CBS and Viacom possibly recombining and John Malone positioned to roll up smaller companies, analysts say. IBD's Media-Diversified group ranks No. 58 out of 197 industry groups, but should move up on M&A speculation. CBS has been the top-ranked stock, and you can find out why at Stock Checkup. Structuring a deal might be challenging for AT&T. Time Warner had a market cap of over $70 billion, and AT&T had just over $7 billion in cash on its books as of June 30. AT&T has about $120 billion in debt, while Time Warner has $24 billion in debt.Any AT&T offer for Time Warner would be mostly stock, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.""AT&T is much more levered than what it appears,"" Moffett told IBD. ""You have to wonder what Time Warner's appetite would be if a large component of the deal is AT&T equity.""Moffett adds that chances of regulatory approval would only be 50-50.Bloomberg reported that AT&T is in a rush because of other possible bidders. Apple raised the idea of buying Time Warner at a meeting between the two companies in late 2015, but talks never advanced, the Financial Times said in May.Speculation over AT&T's interest in Time Warner follows reports that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google has signed up CBS as its first broadcasting partner for a web TV service.""We believe that hyperscale internet companies will be looking to sell a full suite of communications/cloud services to customers to achieve maximum economies of scale,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a research report. ""As they directly connect content with end users, the carriers will respond. Time Warner should fit in fairly well with AT&T's wireless and (internet video) services.""AT&T's launch of DirecTVNow, an internet video service, might be a factor, analysts say.""The upcoming launch of the DirecTV OTT/mobile product certainly provides a reason for AT&T to want to acquire quality content assets,"" said Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a research report. ""However, the price paid for any deal could be overkill and exclusivity is not necessary and in fact may not be a good use of Time Warner's valuable content.""Federal regulators placed tough conditions on Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE). Most of those conditions sunset in 2018.Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital, says AT&T would face regulatory scrutiny.""The big strategic question is what sort of operating synergies could the combined company achieve? We presume regulators would require AT&T to maintain arms-length transactions with Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. Industry logic would say AT&T would want or need other networks' content on its pay TV offerings,"" Yong said in a report.While Apple has shelved a web TV service amid stalled talks with media companies, many analysts believe cash-rich Apple could re-emerge as a player.

200,FOXA,"Netflix's (NFLX) whopping $6 billion content budget for 2017 may resemble a young tech company's strategy for growth before profit.But its Hollywood spending spree — like a reported $120 million budget for ""The Get Down"" and a $40 million price tag for two Chris Rock specials — has trained a glaring soundstage Klieg light on what could be Netflix's emerging identity crisis.""This is just idiotic,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Investor's Business Daily. ""What's the replay-ability of Chris Rock? I mean, he's funny, but come on. I think Netflix's spending is out of control. I think they're doing really dumb things, like a four-picture deal with Adam Sandler.""Netflix's stock is nearing its record high, but concerns over costs — and plans for 1,000 hours of original content next fiscal year — are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media, or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup?The distinction between being considered a tech vs. a media stock isn't just a philosophical one. As the media and tech sectors converge, it may affect any takeover price for Netflix, and there's been chatter it could become a target for Walt Disney (DIS). While the pairing has been seen as unlikely, reports that AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) are near a megamerger lifted shares of Netflix (3.3%), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) (2.2%), CBS (CBS) (2.1%) and Viacom (VIAB) (2.7%) as well as Time Warner's (7.8%) on the stock market today.Categorizing Netflix as a media stock vs. a tech stock would also prompt Wall Street to view its financials with a different lens.Tech hotshots can shell out big bucks, and investors hardly blink. Facebook's (FB) $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014 knocked down shares for a bit, but even then analysts appeared to go easy on the Mark Zuckerberg-helmed Silicon Valley darling as they looked far into the future.Netflix has gotten ""a lot of free passes"" over the last few years, said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie media analyst.""I think internet companies are given a lot of credit for just growing viewership figures, or in this case subscriber numbers, without much regards to the cost,"" he said, adding that ""the cost is viewed as the driver of those subscriber figures, and 'We'll worry about earnings later on,' seems to be the attitude.""Not so with media companies, whose near-term and longer-term earnings figures get more scrutiny.""Costs are a major, major element here,"" said Nollen.Netflix's budget is already bigger than comparable ones at most entertainment conglomerates. The streaming company is expected to spend $4.93 billion on content this year, outdoing nonsports cable and broadcast programming expenses at Time Warner ($4.89 billion), Disney ($4.5 billion) and Viacom ($3.7 billion), according to MoffettNathanson's estimates.Indeed, Netflix's free-spending ways have caused friction with the incumbent companies by outbidding them for coveted new shows and films or often pushing up the price tags on deals they do secure.But rather than a tech company like Apple (AAPL), whose iTunes store helped transform the music industry, Silicon Valley-based Netflix has pointed to a media superstar when signaling its aspirations: Content Chief Ted Sarandos memorably told GQ three years ago that the company's goal was to ""become HBO faster than HBO can become us.""Wedbush's Pachter points out that HBO owns its originals, unlike Netflix, which could only count summer hit ""Stranger Things"" as a completely in-house effort during its conference call. And to label Netflix a media company like Disney, he said, would be ""unflattering to Disney.""But it was licensed shows like ""Orange Is The New Black"" and ""House of Cards"" that put Netflix on Hollywood's map, figuratively and literally. The company is leasing the 14-story, 323,000-square-foot Icon tower and several stages at Sunset Bronson Studios in Los Angeles.Now, like an actor-turned-director, Netflix appears to be yearning for more creative control, and is increasing investments in original programming.The step up from licensing other people's content to creating its own is a ""natural progression"" from its early days of being a content-licensing pure-play, said BTIG Research analyst Rich Greenfield.In his view, however, Netflix ""doesn't want just to be HBO; it wants to be HBO, FX, Nickelodeon, ABC, CBS."" (Time Warner owns HBO, 21st Century Fox owns FX, Viacom owns Nickelodeon and Disney owns ABC).But that evolution arguably nudges Netflix into the more traditional territory of being a hit-driven business, which is a risky business.""That helps when it's good,"" said Nollen. ""But all studios go through winning and losing streaks. And they could have high expectations for a show that maybe doesn't work so well and doesn't attract subscribers, and they're definitely exposing themselves to more of that.""In the near term, Netflix's growth-first strategy could be tested as Amazon (AMZN), the original tech disrupter that keeps disrupting new sectors, ramps up its video offerings and threatens to do to Netflix what it has done to Big Media.Like Netflix, Amazon spends aggressively to grow in new markets. Unlike Netflix, Amazon has pockets that are even deeper than those of the media conglomerates that dominate Hollywood. Netflix's projected 2016 revenue is $8.8 billion, while Amazon's is $136.8 billion.And Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said in July that the company is ""nearly doubling"" its content spend in the second half of 2016 vs. the latter half of last year. (It spent $1.3 billion on content in 2014.)Netflix's current share price ""fails to address the potential for meaningful competition from Amazon"" and its paid Amazon Prime Video-only offering, even if Netflix currently has the stronger brand as a subscription video-on-demand service, said Pachter in a recent note.""(W)e are confident that with its new stand-alone service, Amazon declared war on Netflix,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, investors largely overlooked Netflix's ""unacceptably high"" negative $1.5 billion in projected 2016 free cash flow, he added.For now, Netflix's stock looks to continue taking investors on a wild ride, especially around earnings season. The last three quarterly reports sent the stock soaring 19%, diving 13% and plunging 13% the following day.""I think we can all see that it's time for me to apologize for the volatility again,"" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in response to an analyst question during the earnings call. ""This time it's in a good direction. But I think more and more investors are able to look at the multiyear picture and they see the patterns emerging, and so then it will be less and less about our guidance.""That doesn't bother BTIG's Greenfield: ""The reality is, as the world shifts to (internet protocol) television, the legacy TV industry isn't equipped to meet the changing landscape and Netflix is taking advantage of that.""RELATED: Is Netflix Back On The Road To Prosperity, Or A Trail Of Tears?

201,FOXA,"Speculation that telecom conglomerate AT&T (T) and media giant Time Warner (TWX) are in merger talks is back.Senior executives at AT&T and Time Warner have met in recent weeks to discuss various business strategies, including a possible merger, according to a Bloomberg report posted just before the close of regular trading Thursday. Time Warner stock jumped more than 4% on the news but was flat in after-hours trading, as was AT&T stock.CNBC in September said AT&T was exploring a jump into the media business following its 2015 acquisition of satellite broadcaster DirecTV Group. The New York Post first reported in January that AT&T had been kicking the tires at Time Warner.AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook on Thursday declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.""We view a merger scenario as unlikely,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report. ""AT&T has publicly stated that its 'plate is full' integrating the DirecTV asset, leading us to believe another large transaction isn't in the offing near term.""We wouldn't be surprised if the two parties were discussing strategy, particularly as Time Warner content is being offered as part of the pending launch of DirecTV Now, and AT&T is looking to develop innovative video services.""A Barclays analyst, though, says AT&T could be interested.""TWX is one of the few media companies without super voting shares and has the potential to provide immediate industry scale,"" said Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar in a recent research note.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) acquired NBCUniversal in 2011 from General Electric (GE).""Though there could be some industrial logic to the speculated TWX-T combination (similar to CMCSA-NBCU in hindsight), we believe the upfront financial benefits do not seem as readily apparent,"" the Barclays analyst added. ""It is difficult for us to see the positive financial benefits on a stand-alone financial basis. Therefore, the logic for the transaction would largely have to be predicated on competitive necessities, opportunity costs and revenue synergies with benefits unlikely to accrue immediately.""AT&T rival Verizon Communications (VZ) acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015. It agreed to buy Yahoo (YHOO) for $4.83 billion in July, although that deal may be renegotiated or scuttled because of an email breach at the internet firm.Time Warner rejected a takeover bid by 21st Century Fox (FOXA) in 2014.

205,FOXA,"Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) chief executives tried to shrug off the summer superhero doldrums at Goldman Sachs' annual Communacopia conference Wednesday, a stark contrast to Walt Disney's (DIS) Hollywood bullishness.The critics were unkind to this summer's DC Comics-based movies, but Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes said that the studio's DC superhero movies -- i.e. ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" -- were ""very successful"" in their strategic and financial aims.""Every panel ... requires talking out of both sides of their mouths,"" he said. ""This is the part where we say, 'Pay no attention to the critics.' ""Unlike Disney's Marvel movies, 2016's DC flicks received thumbs down.""Suicide Squad"" earned but a 26% on movie-review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, while ""Batman v Superman"" did little better at 27%. Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War,"" by contrast, boasts a 90%.But Bewkes isn't wrong that the movies, while not critics' favorites, are far from box office failures. ""Batman v Superman"" grossed $873.3 million worldwide and ""Suicide Squad"" has brought in $720.1 million, according to Box Office Mojo.That's not as much as ""Civil War,"" which raked in nearly $1.2 billion, but it is better than 2013's ""Thor: The Dark World"" ($644.6 million) and 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" ($623.9 million).Still, out of the top 10 grossing movies ever on a global basis, three of them are Marvel properties: ""The Avengers,"" ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Iron Man 3.""Bewkes maintains that the studio's ""strategy worked ... execution did deliver,"" but also acknowledged moments before that DC Comics characters have ""a little more lightness in them"" than what was represented in the summer's movies.""We can do a little better on the creative,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.Time Warner shares closed up 1.7% at 76.66 in the stock market today.Not long after that, 21st Century Fox head James Murdoch said on Goldman's stage that when it comes to the company's film studio, ""we have not been as consistent as we want to be.""February release ""Deadpool"" was a surprise hit with moviegoers, making $782.6 million at the global box office, but ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was ill-received by critics, with a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes. It made $543.5 million.But Murdoch said that he is ""really excited about the future slate.""""I feel better creatively today than we have for a while,"" he said.Among the remaining films in 20th Century Fox's 2016 studio pipeline are ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" and ""Assassin's Creed,"" the latter of which is based on the video game of the same name.Disney, meanwhile, is already looking ahead to 2021 to figure out how to continue to tap its ""Star Wars"" gold mine.

206,FOXA,"The drum roll goes on for AT&T's (T) launch of ""DirecTV Now,"" an 100-plus-channel Internet video service, as the industry waits for AT&T to announce its pricing for the service.AT&T is expected to launch DirecTV Now this quarter.How much cable TV rivals such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) need to worry about the DirecTV Now launch depends a lot on its pricing.And AT&T's pricing also could impact the strategies of Hulu, which is expected to launch a new live streaming TV service in early 2017; Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and other new entrants in the so-called OTT, or over-the-top, video market.""If they price too aggressively, there is an obvious risk of cannibalization,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said via email. ""They make very attractive margins on their legacy DTV business today.""Offering an internet-based alternative will mean lower costs, particularly for equipment, so they can justify a lower price. But that doesn't mean they can justify pricing at razor thin margins. That would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.""Nomura Securities weighed in on Friday, saying AT&T might bite the bullet on mid-single-digit profit margins and sell DirecTV Now for $55 monthly. UBS analyst John Hodulik earlier estimated that AT&T could sell DirecTV Now for $50 a month.""We view DirecTV Now as a potential game-changer, but with two caveats: The customer is not locked into a contract and Hulu is expected to launch a competing OTT product in early 2017,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research report Friday.Hulu's live streaming service is expected to cost around $40 a month.IBD'S TAKE: High-dividend paying stocks such as AT&T and Verizon have cooled off amid talk that interest rates may rise. Some large cap companies, such as Facebook or Edwards Lifesciences, offer faster growth. Check out the IBD Big Cap 20.Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS)and Comcast. Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.At a Goldman Sachs conference in September, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said DirecTV Now will roll out at a ""very, very aggressive price point. Stephenson said AT&T will accept thinner margins than usual in the pay TV business.Still, there's wiggle room in AT&T's comments because DirecTV Now has been described at a fat bundle, with a lot of content, not a skinny bundle with fewer channels. AT&T announced plans for DirecTV Now in January.Programming will be AT&T's biggest cost. AT&T has lined up content from most media firms, with the exception of CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment, analysts say. But there may be other costs.William Power, an analyst at William Blair, says AT&T might use Akamai Technologies' (AKAM) content delivery network to whisk Internet video to homes.Akamai's services might be needed because AT&T's DirecTV Now will stream live TV, including sports. AT&T will provide one or two data streams per household. For wireless customers, DirecTV Now usage will not count toward monthly data caps.UBS estimates DirecTV Now could have 2.5 million customers by 2020. Hodulik is cautious on forecasts because OTT competition will likely heat up.""We believe Amazon is well underway with developing a linear TV service, and we doubt that Apple (AAPL) has permanently shelved its plans,"" he said in a research report.AT&T stock fell 0.6% to 38.87 in the stock market today.RELATED:AT&T Downgraded On Apple iPhone Competition, Comcast Wireless EntryIPhone 7 Bottom Line: 'Apple's Gain, Carriers' Pain'

A Han Solo movie is planned for 2018, ""Episode IX"" is slated for 2019, and another film is due in 2020, rumored to be focused on bounty hunter Boba Fett.Iger said at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia media conference Wednesday that Disney is now looking at 2021 and beyond, as he also heralded the strategy that's been in place to produce fewer but bigger films.Disney shares were down 0.6% to close the regular session at 92.39 on the stock market today, continuing to crawl at the low end of a flat base with a 106.85 buy point. Rival 21st Century Fox (FOXA) ticked up 0.5% to 24, Time Warner (TWX) climbed 1.7% to 76.66, and NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) gained 1.4% to 67.16.

212,FOXA,"Dish Network (DISH) will make some Viacom (VIA) cable networks available on its Sling Web TV service as part of a programming deal that sent shares of both the satellite TV broadcaster and the media company up on Thursday.Viacom stock was up nearly 11% in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Dish Network stock was up 1.5%.Terms of the programming contract renewal, announced Thursday morning, were not disclosed. The deal averted a blackout of 18 Viacom channels on Dish Network’s satellite TV service.A protracted battle might have hurt both companies, analysts say. Viacom stock is down more than 35% in the past 12 months, while Dish stock has shed about 30%.“We view the overhang removal (for Viacom) as significant and believe the deal allows the company more flexibility and time regarding options for a Paramount partial sale stake,” said Benjamin Mogil, an analyst at Stifel, in a research report.Dish stock has dropped amid investor concern over its wireless strategy. Dish has been unable to find a buyer for its wireless radio spectrum or a wireless partner to offer mobile video services.Its online video service Sling, which starts at $20 monthly, has been growing. UBS analyst John Hodulik on Thursday upped his year-end Sling subscriber estimate to 1.5 million from 1.2 million.Dish recently added a separate Sling package featuring add-on channels from 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Sling will offer Comedy Central, Spike, MTV, Nick Jr. and other channels later this year under the new programming deal.

213,FOXA,"Drone racing is now going mainstream, with ESPN agreeing to a multiyear distribution deal with the International Drone Racing Association on Wednesday.The first event that the ""worldwide leader in sports"" will showcase is the U.S. National Drone Racing Championship this August in New York.Some say the sport is poised to become the next Nascar or Formula 1, with the same high-speed rush and potential for corporate sponsorships. The only difference is the driver, or pilot, is controlling the exhilarating experience through goggles displaying live video from the point-of-view of the drone.The IDRA says drone racing is seeing an ""unprecedented rise in popularity,"" and ESPN says the fans are ""a growing and passionate audience.""IBD attended a drone racing event earlier this year to find out firsthand what the quadcopter sport is all about.""It's like video games on steroids,"" said a pilot at the event, who goes by the nickname ""Bapu.""The deal includes live streaming on ESPN3 and follow-up one-hour specials of the events on an ESPN network.The pact comes as the Walt Disney (DIS)-owned sports network is looking for new audiences as it loses subscribers at a concerning pace, alongside the rise of video-streaming services.ESPN has also experimented with broadcasting video-game championship events to get more viewers.Though ESPN seems to be struggling, live sports content has not yet been tackled by Netflix (NFLX) or  Amazon (AMZN) Video -- or by Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Disney shares rose 2.2% on the stock market today. Netflix climbed 2.5%, Amazon.com 1.9%, Fox 1.7% and Comcast 0.4%.
"
214,FOXA,"Get ready to grab your popcorn -- we’re now less than a week away from Netflix’s (NFLX) Q1 earnings report next Monday, April 18.In Tuesday's session, the stock was able to retake a critical level -- the 200-day line -- that it has been struggling to recapture. Can it hold above that level Wednesday?The video-streaming powerhouse’s bottom line is projected to drop 73% to three cents a share as amid rising costs for its global rollout. Netflix hasn’t seen that large an earnings decline since Q4 2012.Analysts expect revenue for the quarter to jump 25% to $1.97 billion, which would be Netflix’s fastest growth in the last four quarters.And maybe even more so than those figures, Wall Street will be looking closely at subscriber growth -- a key metric for Netflix.In Q4, Netflix's earnings and revenue beat estimates. So did its overall subscriber additions of 5.6 million, boosted by international markets. But its U.S. subscriber additions of 1.56 million missed expectations for 1.65 million new subscribers. The miss represented a slowdown in U.S. growth and sent shares tumbling over the next several weeks.Netflix may be able to redeem itself. A Baird survey out late last month points to “solid” U.S. additions in Q1, fueled by the recent launches of new seasons of original shows like “House of Cards” and “Daredevil.”Netflix itself has projected 6.1 million net additions for Q1 vs. 4.9 million a year earlier.Look for positive results to be a catalyst for the stock, which is currently trading 20% below its all-time high, reached in early December. Netflix has struggled to retake the 200-day line but finally climbed above that level Tuesday as it rallied 4.2%. Shares have risen more than 30% from their February low, hit in the wake of Netflix’s last quarterly report. (Netflix stock rose 1.5% in afternoon trade Wednesday after bigger gains in the morning.)In May, “grandfathered-in” subscribers will see a $2 price increase to $9.99 a month. One analyst sees the price increase creating a churn of just 3% to 4%, which is relatively low.One big reason why cord cutters may be unlikely to cut their Netflix subscriptions is the content. Morgan Stanley says that Netflix’s original content is now No. 1, putting it above Time Warner (TWX)-owned HBO for the first time in the six years that Morgan Stanley has been tracking the video services.Still, the company faces stiff competition from a growing list of competitors besides HBO, including Hulu -- co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- and Amazon (AMZN) Video.Netflix’s leadership in video streaming could make it a good acquisition target for Disney -- or so said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield in a report last week. He says that the buy would help the House of Mouse with succession planning and the erosion of its ABC and ESPN broadcast businesses.But whether or not Disney is actually interested in the move remains to be seen.Image provided by Shutterstock.

215,FOXA,"Stock markets struggled for a second straight week as Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year closing low. Tesla Motors (TSLA) stock skidded as skeptics doubted production plans, Under Armour (UA) lost key execs, while shale producers topped low-ball output targets, and Alibaba (BABA) reported strong revenue growth.With the market uptrend already under pressure, stocks continued to slide. The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, dropping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting its 200-day line in the prior week. Apple fell to the lowest since mid-2014, and Tesla Motors tumbled. But Facebook (FB) held on to the prior week's big earnings-related gain. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% for the week, but on Friday found support at the 50-day moving average after briefly undercutting that key area for the first time in two months.The U.S. economy added just 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months. Earlier in the week, ISM's manufacturing index signaled activity barely increased last month, while productivity fell for a second straight quarter. Those headline figures suggested the U.S. is resolving the contradiction -- solid labor market gains but sputtering economic growth -- in favor of weaker hiring. But wage gains accelerated, and the workweek picked up.The week's economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates at its June meeting.The luxury electric carmaker’s 57-cent Q1 loss was a penny smaller than estimates, while its 70% surge in revenue to $1.6 billion met views. Tesla bumped up its 500,000 unit build plan by two years to 2018, due to Model 3 demand.The stock dropped 5% on Thursday, as analysts said the projection is too optimistic. For the week, Tesla sank 10.8%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Tesla partner Mobileye (MBLY) said Q1 adjusted EPS jumped 88% to 15 cents on a 65% hike in revenue to $75.2 million. Both beat expectations but marked a second straight quarter of decelerating growth. The maker of advanced driver assistance systems is working with big-name automakers on their self-driving technology. Mobileye shares fell 8.3% for the week.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is a Tesla supplier, is due to report earnings next week.Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) confirmed a self-driving technology alliance, with Alphabet buying 100 plug-in hybrid minivans from the automaker to more than double its fleet of test vehicles. It is still yet to be determined who will have the first fully autonomous car ready for the consumer market and when regulators will approve their use.General Motors (GM) and ride-hailing service Lyft also plan to test self-driving electric Chevy Bolt taxis on public roads within a year, the Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of the popular athletic apparel maker tumbled nearly 12% for the week, past their 50-day moving average, as Under Armour announced the July departures of its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer. The exits prompted a downgrade to hold from buy from Brean Capital, which nevertheless remains positive on the stock's long-term outlook. Meanwhile, comeback kid Adidas reported 22% currency-neutral sales growth in North America.Alleviating worries of a slowdown amid a lethargic local economy, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth reported a view-topping 39% Q4 sales leap to $3.75 billion -- the highest growth rate in four quarters. EPS jumped 88% to 33 cents excluding various items, but that fell short. Now Alibaba is gunning for $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume in about four years. Alibaba shares rose 2.9% for the week. Rival JD.com reports Monday.Next year is shaping up as the so-called “inflection point” for cord-cutters -- consumers that cancel pay TV subscriptions.Alphabet's Google YouTube is reportedly ramping up a subscription-based online video streaming service called ""Unplugged"" that would feature live TV channels. Hulu -- a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- also reportedly plans to expand beyond on-demand content and stream live TV.By 2017, Verizon Communications (VZ) will likely expand its ad-supported Go90 mobile video service to multiple video streaming platforms.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Networks' (DISH) “Sling” Web TV service, meanwhile, seems to be gaining traction.Wild cards? Netflix (NFLX) says it’ll stick to its business model. Apple’s negotiations with TV broadcasters have stalled but could be rekindled. Amazon.com (AMZN) also figures to be a player at some point.Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their 2016 production targets as costs came down in Q1. But shale firms are hesitant to resume drilling until prices hit at least $50 for a sustained period of time, and not just a uptick from OPEC meetings or supply disruptions from the Middle East. ""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" Continental CEO Harold Hamm said on the company's conference call. Even as crude prices rebound, E&Ps will be looking to first use cash flow for capital spending and to reduce debt, then complete drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), before considering drilling again.Oil prices finished the week near $45 a barrel.After missing analyst estimates in March, the Big Three U.S. automakers -- GM, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler -- showed only marginal improvement in April U.S. sales, seeming to confirm predictions by some analysts and industry executives that domestic demand could plateau this year. GM sales fell 3.5% vs. April 2015 to 259,447, in large part due to a drop in low-margin sales to rental fleets. Ford sales rose 4% to 231,316, but both GM and Ford were below forecasts. Fiat Chrysler rose 6% to 199,631 units, beating Edmunds.com’s 5% estimate.Meanwhile, Ford sales in China fell 11% in April, while GM’s sales there rose 7.5%, partly on a 13% pop in Cadillac sales.GM shares fell 2.6%, Ford 0.9% and Fiat Chrysler 4.6% for the week, trading near their 50-day lines.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) on Monday handily beat first-quarter forecasts and boosted its quarterly dividend by 37%, following similarly strong results in March from rival Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Both companies have benefited from an increasingly diverse crowd of shooting enthusiasts. Regulatory concerns and widening fears following mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Europe have also made guns more popular in the U.S.On Wednesday, the FBI reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April. That’s the best April on record for the system but lower than recent months, in keeping with similar patterns in previous years. The background checks are used as an indicator of gun demand, and stocks of both companies have been sensitive over the years to signs of demand topping out.Sturm Ruger rallied 5.5% Monday ahead of results and climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but the stock found resistance at the 50-day line and ended the week up 2.6%. Smith & Wesson also wrapped the week with pared gains.

219,FOXA,"As Comcast (CMCSA) nears the launch of a Netflix (NFLX) app on its cable set-top boxes, whether it'll provide the same support for Hulu's upcoming live TV service looms as a big question.Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast. Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.Hulu in early 2017 is expected to launch a new live streaming TV service, priced at around $40 monthly. Hulu's live service might pose more of a threat to Comcast's  cable TV business than Netflix's on-demand service, some analysts say.Netflix is more akin to HBO, which also is available on Comcast's X1 set-top boxes.Comcast CEO Brian Roberts showcased how Netflix programming will be presented on Comcast's X1 cable platform at a Goldman Sachs conference on Tuesday.Roberts also signaled that Comcast might offer other streaming video services, aside from Netflix. ""Our organization has made a conscious decision that we are going to aggregate other people's content, some of which we sell directly, some of which we don't,"" Roberts said.""Netflix, as we know, is wildly successful, and it has pretty much got content that you don't get with your (Comcast) X1 existing subscription,"" added Roberts.Shares of Comcast ticked up 0.6% to 66.23, while Netflix added 0.2% to 98.25 at the close on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock is down about 13% in 2016 and has been trading in a tight range in lower volume amid higher investments.

220,FOXA,"Sumner Redstone's National Amusements is officially pushing for CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) to get back together, a decade after the two entertainment conglomerates split. But how that could happen remains a puzzle, leaving some investors wondering what to do with shares.Viacom said Thursday that it had received a letter from National Amusements asking the company to consider an all-stock merger with CBS. National Amusements, of which Redstone is the CEO and his daughter Shari Redstone is president, controls about 80% of both Viacom and CBS' voting shares.""This has been a source of enormous confusion among investors, based on our conversations, given the diverse outcomes that are possible,"" Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a note Thursday.The general sentiment among Wall Street analysts is that Viacom and its struggling cable channels, which include Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1 and BET, would benefit from a merger, but that CBS is doing just fine on its own, given the success of its stand-alone broadcast network, premium cable channel Showtime and other CBS-branded properties.Here are three stock scenarios for any CBS-Viacom merger that Barclays lay out:Barclays advocates having exposure to both CBS and Viacom.""We believe this not only provides a hedge against a take-under scenario for Viacom and a premium deal for CBS, it also allows a more attractive payoff ratio relative to a stake in either company,"" Venkateshwar wrote.CBS shares rose 0.8% to 54.57 in the stock market today, adding to the 4% spike Wednesday, when reports of a merger proposal emerged. Viacom shares rallied 3.3% to 37.77 Thursday, after rising 3.1% the day before.Shares of other media giants also little changed in late-afternoon action. Disney (DIS) fell 0.4% while Time Warner (TWX) edged up 0.1%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) fell 1.1% and NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.Any CBS-Viacom deal would have to be attractive enough overcome the reluctance of CBS CEO Les Moonves, who just two weeks ago downplayed the idea of a merger at Bank of America Merrill Lynch's annual media conference.""Truth of the matter is that we are a stand-alone public company. We are really happy with the hand we are playing. We're doing extraordinarily well on our own with our own assets,"" he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ""We're never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders or employees. We're not in active discussions for anything like that.""The two companies' different approaches to distribution and channel concentration depth are behind CBS' reluctance to make a deal, wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil on Sept. 6.""Further concerning CBS is not only the number of cable channels which need to be supported in carriage discussions but the eroding ratings at the core channels and programming underinvestment that continues to be a headwind for ratings growth,"" he said.Mogil also asserts that ""one of the major stumbling blocks for CBS"" in a merger scenario would be doing a deal that includes Paramount Pictures, Viacom's ailing studio arm. A partial sale of Paramount might make CBS view a combination more favorably.RELATED:Netflix 'Star Trek' Deal Helps CBS Chief Les Moonves Sleep At Night Twitter Stock Reverses Up As Disney Reportedly Weighs Bid

223,FOXA,"At this summer's DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam, a vast, sun-baked plane of concrete, drones the size of overgrown insects carved wide cursive loops through the dam's broad archways. They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race. ""We're creating this massive furnace for innovation.""The sport has grown big enough that Disney's (DIS) ESPN will air races and started with an introductory program Thursday. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

226,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX), watch out: The big boys are banding together. Time Warner said it is joining peers Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal in becoming a joint owner in streaming service Hulu.The HBO and TNT parent is acquiring a 10% stake. The deal is worth $583 million, according to Wall Street Journal sources, and values Hulu at $5.8 billion. Disney, Fox and Comcast had previously been equal 33% stakeholders in Hulu, with the Journal reporting last fall that Time Warner had been mulling an equal 25% stake.Time Warner turned in mixed results early Wednesday, topping Q2 earnings views but falling short on revenue. The company hiked 2016 EPS guidance by a nickel to $5.35-$5.45 vs. current Wall Street estimates for $5.39.Time Warner rose 2.7% to 77.83 at Wednesday's close in the stock market today. Netflix shares fell 0.5% to 93.10.The move comes after about a year of hand-wringing over the health of the pay-TV and cable environment, which has weighed on media stocks and put even heavyweights like Disney under the microscope.IBD'S TAKE: Media heavies are looking for new ways to engage younger audiences, and virtual reality is the latest investment that they are hoping will resonate with a digital savvy crowd. Check out our recent report, ""Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.""Furthermore, Time Warner said Wednesday that it will be adding a number of its networks to Hulu's live-streaming service, including CNN, Cartoon Network, TNT, TBS and others.

229,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) reports third-quarter results after the close Tuesday. Between its studios, networks, theme parks and products, there's a lot going on at the House of Mouse.Read on for what to expect, and come back later for the results.Wall Street is expecting 11% third-quarter profit growth to $1.61 per share on 8% in revenue gains to $14.15 billion.The entertainment conglomerate has been disappointing analysts in recent quarters, missing earnings estimates in the second quarter and falling short of revenue expectations for three out of the last four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters.Shares shaved 8 cents off their price to 95.75 at the close Monday, ahead of earnings, and are trading up about 0.3% to 96.02 in the pre-market hours Tuesday.As it builds a flat base, the stock has been trading below its 200-day line since early May. And since mid-May, shares have infrequently come up for air above their 50-day moving average.Is Disney still a Hollywood sweetheart? The mega-success of the seventh ""Star Wars"" was a high point for Disney's theatrical arm. But some worried that Han Solo would be a solo studio-revenue spike.Even outside of the Lucasfilm franchise, however, Marvel and Pixar have been pumping out hits, feeding the public's appetite for superhero movies and adorable animation.Flicks like ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Finding Dory"" performed well during the quarter.Per Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil: ""We continue to be of the view that the Studio and corresponding Consumer Products segments continue to deserve a strong multiple reflecting the very strong pipeline which the Studio continues to have and which we believe no longer justifies an asterisk or a one-off and instead is more reflective of a strong cycle from not just from Marvel and Pixar, but increasingly from Disney Animation and Disney live action.""Is ESPN experiencing more subscriber losses? Ever since Bob Iger's year-ago comments on ""modest"" ESPN subscriber losses that prompted investors to take a light saber to media stocks, it's practically become a staple on earnings calls now for the Disney chief to field questions about the state of the company's cable moneymaker.Why all the pearl-clutching over how many people pay to get ESPN? For reference, Disney's cable networks segment alone made up over 30% of revenue in the previously announced quarter, and its broader media networks unit -- which includes cable -- accounted for about 45% of total revenue.And in the age of cord cutting, every eyeball matters.IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.The panic has subsided to a nervous whisper. In May, Iger told analysts on the call that Disney's inclusion on bundles from Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue had contributed to ""incremental subs"" for ESPN during the quarter.Still, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich expects ""slower growth than in the past as competition for consumer time and entertainment dollars increases,"" according to a July 29 note.What's going on with Hulu? Hulu -- the streaming service jointly owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, and now Time Warner (TWX) -- is launching a live-streaming TV package next year. (Yahoo (YHOO) and Hulu just struck a licensing deal for its free content, by the way.)Iger said last quarter that Hulu has ""become an important investment for us,"" not just as a distributor, but also as a buyer of original content and distributor of Disney's channels.He added that the company ""feel(s) really good about the opportunity.""Expect more commentary on Disney's new Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened to praise and good reviews.

232,FOXA,"After amassing a portfolio of critically acclaimed original TV series, Amazon.com (AMZN) has decided the time is right for its subscription streaming video service to go head-to-head with industry leader Netflix (NFLX).The Seattle-based e-commerce giant late Sunday revealed that it will offer its Amazon Prime Video as a stand-alone service for $8.99 a month, a dollar less than Netflix's standard streaming plan.Amazon Prime Video was launched five years ago as an extra for subscribers of Amazon Prime, a program that offers free two-day shipping on millions of items. Amazon Prime costs $99 a year. In addition to the stand-alone video service, Amazon also is offering full Prime membership on a monthly basis. Customers can pay $10.99 a month with no annual commitment or save 25% by paying for the full-year plan.Like Netflix, Amazon has been investing in original content as well as signing exclusive licensing deals for cable and broadcast shows. Amazon original series include “Transparent,” “Mozart in the Jungle,” “Catastrophe,” “Bosch,” “The Man in the High Castle” and “Red Oaks.”Other competitors in the Internet video sector include Hulu and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO. Hulu is co-owned by Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS) and Fox (FOXA).Amazon's move comes as many long-time Netflix customers will see the price of their service jump from $7.99 to $9.99 a month starting next month. Netflix boosted its pricing starting two years ago, but it provided grace periods for existing customers.Netflix stock was down about 3% to near 108 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings after the market close today.Amazon stock was up almost 1% to about 631. Amazon gets an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out of a possible 99, and Netflix a 51.For when to buy, hold or sell off Amazon and other top stocks, sign up for a free trial of IBD LeaderboardAmazon is offering the stand-alone video service only in the U.S. for now, but it is likely to take it to international markets soon, CCS Insight analyst Paolo Pescatore said in a research note Monday.Amazon’s new video offer will limit Netflix’s ability to grow its domestic subscriber base, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a research note Sunday.“The monthly video offering reflects Amazon’s determination to capture an increased share of Netflix’s addressable market,” he said. “While we don’t expect a significant number of current Netflix customers to defect to Amazon Instant Video, it is likely that Amazon and Netflix will divide the remaining uncommitted market on a roughly equal basis, severely impacting Netflix’s continued domestic growth.”Pachter believes Amazon timed the offer to take advantage of the impending price increase at Netflix.An estimated 30 million domestic Netflix subscribers will see their monthly subscription fees go up starting May 9, he said.Pachter rates Amazon stock as outperform with a price target of 700 and Netflix as underperform with a price target of 45.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said Monday that the Amazon offer “creates a negative headwind for Netflix.”However, Mahaney reiterated his outperform rating on Netflix with a price target of 140.“We view this move by Amazon as a significant negative development for Netflix,” he said in a report. “Amazon certainly has the brand name, the customer relationships and the focus on high-quality consumer experiences to impact the growth in Netflix’s U.S. subscriber base, and perhaps eventually its global subscriber base.”Netflix is facing growth challenges in the U.S. market. In the fourth quarter last year, it missed its own target for new domestic subscribers. But its international growth easily beat expectations and offset U.S. weakness.In a survey released last week, consumers ranked Netflix as No. 1 for original programming. It topped HBO for the first time in the six years that Morgan Stanley has tracked consumer preferences in premium video services.Some 29% of survey respondents said Netflix was best in original programming, up from 23% last year, while HBO came in second place at 18% (compared with 31% last year), Morgan Stanley said. Amazon.com, Hulu and CBS (CBS)-owned Showtime were each near 5%.Netflix original shows include “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “Narcos” and Marvel comic-book hero shows “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones.”

235,FOXA,"Streaming service Hulu debuted a virtual reality app Thursday, just months after Netflix (NFLX) introduced its own app for fans of 3D content.The Hulu VR app, like its Netflix peer, is supported on the Samsung Gear VR headset and powered by Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus. Viewers will be able to watch original 3D content as well as the existing Hulu library in ""immersive 360-degree environments,"" said Hulu's Head of Experience Ben Smith in a release.The Hulu announcement comes as Facebook prepares to start shipping its Oculus Rift headsets on Monday.Some of those new VR films include titles from Discovery Communications (DISCA), National Geographic, Viacom (VIAB) and Showtime Sports. Then there's the meteor-shower-filled short film ""The Big One,"" which Hulu made in partnership with Lions Gate (LGF).Non-Hulu subscribers can also access the site's 3D movies, Smith said. While the app is available only for Samsung Galaxy users, more supported devices and platforms are on the horizon.Hulu is co-owned by Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Disney shares rose 0.4%. Comcast added 1.3%. Fox dipped 0.2%, and Netflix lost 1.25%.Ahead of the Oculus Rift debut on Monday, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian tempered those expectations, warning that virtual-reality gear makers like Oculus, HTC and Sony (SNE) might initially face a ""trough of disappointment"" in adoption and consumer reaction.Facebook shares edged 0.45% higher.RELATED:Virtual Reality Could Disappoint Initially, Baird SaysContent Is King In The War For First Generation Virtual RealityThese Activision, Disney Alums Are Making VR Shows For Oculus, Vive.

236,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal is turning up the heat on satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) amid contract renewal talks for programming.Dish Network already is facing tough negotiations with Viacom (VIA). Comcast, on the other side as a pay-TV provider, has been in a dispute with sports channel YES Network over programming fees.NBCU has launched a marketing campaign warning viewers they could be blacked out on Dish Network by March 20, says Broadcasting & Cable. NBCU owns cable channels USA Network, Syfy, Bravo, CNBC and  MSNBC.Dish on Tuesday afternoon said it expects to file for arbitration in the dispute with NBCU.“Under the conditions imposed by the FCC and Department of Justice in approving the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger, NBC is forbidden from blacking out its networks if a pay-TV provider chooses, in its sole discretion, to exercise its right for binding arbitration,” Dish said in a statement.Viacom’s 24 cable networks, meanwhile, include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Dish Network has had disputes with CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting unit.Comcast is at an impasse with YES Network. Fox took majority control of the YES Network in 2014 from the New York Yankees’ parent company. The Comcast-YES Network dispute affects about 900,000 Comcast customers in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.According to an Oppenheimer research report, Fox Networks sought a 33% fee increase for YES programming. Walt Disney’s (DIS) ESPN garners the highest content fees.“We believe programming costs will rise sharply in the near term  but will moderate in the longer term as lower advertising revenues and cord cutting weaken the bargaining power of the content providers and ultimately break the paid-TV model,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan. “Programming costs have risen at three times the growth rate of (cable company) revenues during the last five years.”
"
237,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX) has long drawn comparisons to Time Warner’s (TWX) HBO for its critically acclaimed original programming. But the ""Game of Thrones"" premium cable network has no intentions of becoming more like its online-only peer.In response to a question about the depth of content at streaming service HBO Now, and its $14.99 monthly price vs. Netflix's $7.99-$11.99, Time Warner chief exec Jeff Bewkes dismissed the comparison.""We don’t want and we haven’t intended to take that HBO brand and the original programming, and move it to essentially a bulk syndicated (video-on-demand), which is what the new (subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD) entrants mostly have,"" he said Tuesday at the Deutsche Bank 2016 Media, Internet & Telecom Conference.""We do have a very strong current theatrical film offering at HBO that nobody else has, and it should not be overlooked.""Bewkes added, ""We don’t think it’s to HBO’s advantage to join the other three or four SVOD services that are essentially doing broad-reach syndication services,"" likely referring to Netflix, Amazon (AMZN) Video and Hulu, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal.Those services are essentially providing a ""syndication product with originals,"" he said, in contrast to HBO's ""well-established originals strategy and strong movie slate.""He added that HBO Now has ""nearly a million"" subscribers, up from the 800,000 reported during the company's most recent earnings call.Time Warner shares closed down 2% Tuesday. The stock has been bobbing around its 50-day line for months after more decisively breaking support at the key level last August amid the greater media-stock meltdown over the state of the pay-TV environment.Even in distancing the HBO brand from Netflix and Amazon, Bewkes sounded positive on the network’s ability to gain market share among consumers whose viewing habits are increasingly shifting away from traditional TV sets and to mobile devices, citing Vice and Jon Stewart programming that appear or are scheduled to appear on HBO.A lot of that programming is ""aimed at millennials,"" he said. ""It’s great for the broadband product, and it’s very well matched up to the increasing mobile use of HBO Go or HBO Now.""

238,FOXA,"Most cord-cutters still replace cable TV services with Netflix (NFLX) -- no surprise there -- but Apple TV gained in an annual Morgan Stanley survey of consumers who watch Internet video.Apple (AAPL) rolled out its fourth-generation TV hardware in late 2015, but it has shelved plans, at least temporarily, for a Web-based TV service amid stalled negotiations with programmers.The Apple TV streaming device costs from $149 to $199. Apple customers can subscribe to Netflix, HBO and full-season sports subscriptions as well as watch movies and TV shows served up from the iTunes store.Among those planning to cancel pay TV subscriptions, some 35% of the 2,500 consumers surveyed say they are most likely to switch to Netflix, says Morgan Stanley.  That’s down from about 40.7% in the year-earlier study. Apple TV moved up to 23%, from about 17% a year earlier.YouTube, the video website of Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google figures two ways in the survey, in which respondents could give more than one answer. Some 20% of respondents said they might replace pay TV with YouTube Red, the new subscription service, while 29% cited the free, ad-supported version of YouTube.Amazon.com’s (AMZN) online video service and Hulu were tied at 27%, with Time Warner’s (TWX) HBO Now service right behind, with 25% of pay TV subscribers saying they were likely to switch to the service.“Among those without a pay TV subscription, Netflix usage is meaningfully higher (47%) vs. Amazon Instant Video (21%), suggesting Netflix is viewed as more of a replacement service to traditional pay TV,” said the Morgan Stanley report.“Netflix remains the leading online video platform for TV/film content in the US, with 40% of respondents saying that they use the service, still well ahead of YouTube (33%), Amazon Instant Video (22%) and Hulu Plus (14%).”Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA).

239,FOXA,"Hulu is expected to emerge as a greater threat to Netflix (NFLX) as it expands globally and invests in content, but Hulu may prove ""problematic"" to its traditional media owners once it reaches a certain subscriber threshold, wrote Jefferies analyst John Janedis late Sunday.""Although Netflix has dominated the SVOD (subscription video on demand) landscape to date, we expect the platform will face increased competition from Hulu over the next 2-3 years,"" he wrote.Janedis believes that Hulu, the ""domestic (over-the-top) service to watch in '16,"" will increase programming investments and likely seek international audiences in the next 1-3 years, a move that will challenge Netflix's expansion goals abroad.And Hulu may bring another partner into the fold, bolstering its efforts against Netflix. Hulu's owners -- Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal -- have reportedly been in talks to bring on board Time Warner (TWX) as a fourth equity owner.Legacy media makers like Disney, Fox and others have been looking for new ways to connect with viewers as more consumers opt to ""cut the cord,"" nixing their cable subscriptions in favor of online options like Netflix or Amazon (AMZN) Prime Instant Video.Hulu has sought to differentiate itself by offering currently airing series, vs. Netflix's library of past seasons and older shows. And it has been ""more aggressive"" than Netflix and Amazon in making programming investments during recent months, said the report.Netflix remains a favorite among viewers, with 80% of polled millennials calling it ""essential,"" according to a Jefferies survey. But as it gains steam, its relationship with traditional media companies is seen shifting down the road.Janedis anticipates that Netflix will license ""even less"" content from networks in the future as it focuses on original content. And the networks will likely respond by looking to monetize more content on Hulu, he said.But Hulu could be a double-edged sword for Big Media companies.""The longer-term concern is whether a growing Hulu will serve to benefit the networks, by slowing the growth of Netflix, or if its emergence only establishes another threat to traditional television,"" wrote Janedis.Better content, Hulu's new ad-free subscription tier and increased marketing are likely driving subscriber growth. That could be a positive in the short term but ultimately wind up drawing consumers away from traditional broadcasters.""The risk is whether a commercial-free offering, with improved programming, will only serve to accelerate cord cutting. Above a certain level -- 20-30 mil subs -- will likely prove to be problematic,"" Janedis said.Netflix stock rose 3% on the stock market today. Amazon advanced 4.6% as the e-commerce giant raised its minimum order for free shipping to $49 for non-Prime members. That could fuel more Prime customers.Walt Disney stock climbed 1.4%, 21st Century Fox 2.7%, Comcast 0.6% and Time Warner 1.6%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

240,FOXA,"Walt Disney’s (DIS) first-quarter results trounced expectations as “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” boosted the studio and consumer products segments, though the media and entertainment giant continued to lose subscribers for its cable channels.But Disney CEO Robert Iger said Tuesday that ESPN, which lost 7 million subscribers in the last two years, has “actually seen an uptick” in subscribers in recent months, and has benefited from the growth of light cable packages, particularly from Dish (DISH).In what amounted to a vigorous defense of ESPN during a conference call, Iger said skinny bundles with the sports cable channel had even wooed cord cutters back. The idea that ESPN is cratering is “ridiculous,” he said. “Sports is too popular.”Disney shares fell 3% late.Iger also clarified the reason behind ESPN’s subscriber decline, blaming faulty Nielsen figures. Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, “we concluded that our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched,” he said.He said Disney is exploring “new platform providers,” hinting at more over-the-top, or streaming, options for ESPN.Revenue from Disney’s media networks division, which includes ESPN, grew 8% in fiscal Q1. The segment logged higher ad revenue, offset by lower ratings. Higher programming costs weighed on the sports cable channel, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff bowl games, but that was partially offset by an increase in ad and affiliate revenue, said the company.""Affiliate revenue growth was due to contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts,"" Disney said in a statement.The hubbub over ESPN comes amid industry-wide concerns that cable viewers are taking their dollars elsewhere — namely, to Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime and other over-the-top streaming services.During the quarter, adjusted earnings climbed 28% to $1.63 a share, well above views for $1.45 per share. Revenue grew 14% to $15.24 billion vs. consensus estimates for $14.75 billion.“Driven by the phenomenal success of ‘Star Wars,’ we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in the history of our company, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth,” said Iger in a statement.“The Force Awakens” crossed the $2 billion threshold in global box office sales over the weekend. Studio revenue skyrocketed 46%, year over year.Disney’s theme park and resorts segment revenue rose 9%, said the company. Consumer products and interactive media revenue rose 8%.Earlier Tuesday, Viacom (VIAB) shares tanked 21.5% after the media company logged its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines and Q1 revenue fell short of expectations.Earnings fell 8.5% to $1.18, in line with consensus estimates, as sales fell 6% to $3.15 billion, below analysts’ forecasts for $3.26 billion.Viacom's filmed entertainment revenue tumbled 15% on theatrical and home-entertainment revenue declines. Media-networks revenue fell 3% as domestic ad revenue dropped 4% and ratings declined.

251,FOXA,"JPMorgan is bullish on the upcoming “Broadcast Incentive Auction,” which will free up prime, low-frequency airwaves owned by local TV broadcasters for wireless data services.Naysayers continue to contend that the Federal Communications Commission faces many challenges in pulling off a successful auction, which for now is scheduled to start late next month. One risk is that broadcasters might drop out of the auction if they determine that bidding prices are disappointing.The auction is key for T-Mobile US (TMUS), which needs spectrum. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) own most of the available low-frequency spectrum, in which waves travel longer distances, among other advantages over higher-frequency spectrum.JPMorgan expects at least 70 MHz of airwaves, and possibly more, to be auctioned. The key is that broadcasters that own two local TV stations will sell off airwaves from one and keep spectrum from the other, says JPMorgan.“We estimate that 70-100 MHz will be auctioned, for $25 billion to $35 billion,” said JPMorgan in a research report.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s (CMCSA) cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a likely seller of airwaves.Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“We view FOX and CBS as best positioned to monetize duopoly affiliates in large markets, followed by Comcast and Sinclair,” said JPMorgan. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ABC, is not expected to sell airwaves. Private investment firms such as Columbia Capital are eyeing the auction, says a Washington Post report.JPMorgan predicts cable TV firms will show up, but it doubts that Internet giants will bid.""We expect that AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile will be the biggest bidders ($21 billion-$30 billion cumulative spend), that Sprint (S)/SoftBank (SFTBY) will not register, and Dish Network (DISH) will at most be an opportunistic buyer,"" said the JPMorgan report. ""We estimate Comcast, potentially in partnership with other cable companies, could spend $3 billion-$5 billion, and private equity funds in aggregate could spend $1 billion-$2 billion.""We do not expect digital economy players like Alphabet-Google (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) to bid, though they can never be ruled out.”

294,FOXA,"The end of last year brought a host of predictions about how Apple (AAPL) might spend its more than $200 billion in cash and investments. Currently the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is using its cash on hand for stock buybacks and dividends.But some on Wall Street are itching for Apple to pull off a big acquisition with its pile of dough. The latest speculation has Apple among those interested in buying TV and movie giant Time Warner (), which has a current market cap of about $57 billion.The biggest deal Apple has ever made was purchasing Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion in August 2014.A New York Post article on Tuesday suggested that Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes is open to the possibility of a sale of the company. Since then, Apple, AT&T (T) and 21st Century Fox ()have been rumored as potential buyers of the entertainment conglomerate.The Post report said Apple would be interested in Time Warner's assets to support the launch of a stand-alone streaming TV service. Time Warner owns CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT and other cable channels.Fortune writer Philip Elmer-DeWitt outlined the reasons for a deal in a column titled ""Why Apple Should Buy Time Warner.""Apple has been trying for years to assemble a ""skinny bundle"" of popular cable channels for an Internet TV service but without success. Buying Time Warner would give that to Apple in an instant, he said.But just because Apple has the cash doesn't mean they will spend it on a big acquisition. Apple has been loath to make large acquisitions for fear of harming its corporate culture. Apple likes to make small tuck-in acquisitions of companies with interesting technologies or talented engineers. It also has a reputation for wanting to build new products and services in house rather than acquire what someone else has developed.In a Dec. 10 [PAGE[research]] report, FBR analyst Daniel Ives put together a ""Christmas M&A list"" of deals that Apple might consider in 2016. He listed Adobe Systems (ADBE), Box (BOX), GoPro (GPRO) and Tesla Motors (TSLA).""Although we clearly can see Cupertino focusing on a number of skunkworks initiatives (e.g., Project Titan, virtual reality Faceshift, etc.) in 2016 and not pursuing major M&A prospects, with $200 billion of cash in the coffer (and growing), we can finally envision Apple making a larger acquisition, as the conditions are ripe for (CEO Tim) Cook to make a move,"" Ives said.Research firm CCS Insight predicted Nov. 20 that Apple might buy either Box or Dropbox in 2016 to extend its iCloud package of services into the enterprise market.On Dec. 31, Investors.com published a list of ""The wildest tech M&A predictions for 2016.""

295,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) are transforming Hollywood with apparent clarity about what they want: original content, a solid library and paying viewers.But does Big Media, rooted in almost-quaint traditions like upfronts and Nielsen ratings, know how to fight back in this brave new world of cord cutting? Or will the entertainment industry's center of gravity shift permanently to Silicon Valley?The threat of over-the-top (OTT) streaming services keeps raising the stakes for the incumbents, whose varied responses face a daunting task. Channels once deemed impervious are now bleeding subscribers, advertising dollars are getting plowed into digital media, and the disruptors are piling up awards.The trends are once again expected to be scrutinized as media giants report quarterly results in the coming week.Millennials and teens largely consider televisions to be old-school technology. Most 18- to 34-year-olds prefer watching shows on a laptop or mobile device, not a TV, according to a Magid Advisors poll.Major networks have followed young eyeballs over to the web. A hodgepodge of streaming services are available to viewers, ranging from multi-network Hulu to NBC's new comedy-centric outlet, SeeSo.More than 30 new OTT services were introduced in 2015 alone, said research firm SNL Kagan, which tracks over 100 such offerings. The overwhelming number of options might make it seem like traditional media outlets are having a hard time refining their strategies.""I don’t think they’re hyper-focused; I don’t think they’re being sloppy,"" SNL Kagan analyst Ali Choukeir told Investor's Business Daily.But at the same time, there are so many different kinds of online streaming choices out there that it's ""like spinning plates,"" he added. ""There’s just a lot going on.""NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) has Stream for Internet-only customers. Walt Disney (DIS) launched OTT services abroad. Viacom (VIAB) introduced Noggin for kids.TBS and CNN parent Time Warner (TWX) allows users to watch its content from any device. It also offers premium cable network HBO in two streaming forms, HBO Now and HBO Go, the former being a standalone service available to non-cable subscribers.Time Warner is also said to be in talks to acquire a 25% equity stake in Hulu, the online streamer jointly owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Disney and Comcast's NBCUniversal.Wall Street is increasingly paying attention to the paid subscription service with Big Media backing. Once dismissed as ""Clown Co.,"" Hulu is now nothing to laugh at.The service has emerged as a viable OTT competitor to Netflix, Amazon and others, wrote Jefferies analyst John Janedis in a note to clients, highlighting its investment in content and new $11.99 ad-free subscription tier.""We think Hulu is 'the OTT service to watch in 2016,'"" he wrote last month, ""as the impact of these changes starts to unfold, not only to the extent that it may slow Netflix’s subscriber growth, but also if the value proposition accelerates cord cutting of traditional linear television.""Hulu has only 9 million subscribers to Netflix's nearly 45 million video customers in the U.S. (and over 75 million subscribers worldwide). But its growth rate outpaces that of Netflix and its broadcast parentage affords a unique feature: the ability to offer shows that have just aired on linear TV.""With all these guys, especially Netflix and Amazon, they’ve all got original content,"" said Choukeir. ""Original content is a differentiator for sure, but with Hulu, next-day (content) is a further differentiator.""Potential investor Time Warner reportedly is not a fan of the feature, but Choukeir said he doesn't see the core of Hulu's business changing.If Time Warner comes on board, that'll leave CBS (CBS) as the only major network not on the service.But it may be happy to be left alone as it focuses on its streaming service CBS All Access, which offers both a live CBS feed and previously aired content, and mulls a possible streaming subscription service for the CW network, which it co-owns with Time Warner's Warner Bros.So how are Hulu, HBO and the rest of the field faring against digital pure plays?There are no clear winners or losers just yet, said SNL Kagan's Choukeir.""There’s still a lot to be learned,"" he said. ""There’s a lot of experimentation going on.""Strategies may also evolve as media giants find their footing online. Netflix is a double-edged sword for them: Licensing revenue they receive is an appealing source of cash, but giving Netflix access to content is essentially feeding the competition.Time Warner and Fox executives have in recent months raised concerns about the issue, with Fox CEO James Murdoch reportedly saying the company might license more of its programming to Hulu instead.Advertising dollars are at risk, as marketers take their money to digital platforms at the expense of TV. Cowen & Co. believes that ""digital is likely to take several hundred basis points of ad share away from national TV in 2016 and 2017.""Additionally, one area that has long been considered a pay-TV stronghold -- live sports -- faces uncertainty. Disney's longtime moneymaker, ESPN, lost 7 million subscribers between 2013-15, bringing its total to 92 million as of late last year.Concern over subscriber losses and cord-cutting prompted a media meltdown last August. Cowen analyst Doug Creutz noted that media stocks should get ""a bit of a reprieve"" in the first half of 2016 as ad trends have improved, cord-cutting doesn't appear to be accelerating, and the group is trading at a discount to the market.But he also said the major media names ""remain difficult as longer-term investments.""When it comes to online efforts, it may simply be a matter of kicking back on the sofa and watching which streaming subscription services find fame and fortune -- and which get voted off the island.""It’s tough to forecast when we’re going to see a shakeout, because the marketplace is very saturated."" said Choukeir. ""But at the same time, there are a lot of services out there catering to audiences who are buying their content.""

296,FOXA,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — Hollywood movie studios are rethinking video entertainment as the industry approaches the coming age of high-definition virtual reality.Studios will need to offer more than just 360-degree surround video and audio for upcoming headsets such as Facebook's ([STOCK[FB]]) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive and Sony's ([STOCK[SNE]]) PlayStation VR. They will need to provide interactive, immersive storytelling in virtual worlds, members of a Consumer Electronics Show (CES) panel discussion said Wednesday.While the Harry Potter films were about watching a boy wizard grow up, a VR game of the same concept would have to be about the experience of actually being a wizard, said Andy Cochrane, director of interactive and new media and special projects lead at Mirada.""It's not 360 video. That's not VR,"" Cochrane said.

It will be available in March. But it requires a high-end PC to work.""We have to give people a real reason to want to pay $600 for a headset and $1,500 to $2,000 for a super computer, and to make an investment in the content,"" Primus said.Entertainment professionals are excited about the potential for VR.""We see virtual reality as being the fusion of [PAGE[technology]] and storytelling,"" said Aaron Koblin, co-founder and chief technology officer of Vrse.

298,FOXA,"AT&T (T) on Wednesday became the latest pay-TV company to lash out at Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) in the wake of the Federal Communications Commission’s proposal to open up the set-top box market to more suppliers.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler last week proposed a new rule that would make it easier for consumers to switch from set-top boxes rented from cable TV companies to devices sold by consumer electronics or Internet companies.Pay-TV providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) lease broadband cable modems as well as set-top-boxes to consumers, charging them on a monthly basis. The FCC aims to make programming bundles sold by pay-TV companies accessible from a wider range of devices.After Wheeler announced the initiative, Google followed up by demonstrating a set-top box to Congressional staffers at its Washington D.C. office, according to the “Future of TV Coalition,” a lobbying group formed by cable TV companies, industry groups, programmers and others.AT&T, in a blog post on Wednesday, took a shot at Google.“When you get beyond all the hype, Google and its affiliated proponents of this technology mandate are simply trying to take our competitive service and repackage it as their own, without ever having to negotiate with us or with the content owners with whom we had to negotiate to create our service offering. It’s akin to the FCC mandating that we get access to Google’s home page so that we can redesign and rebrand it as our own,” said Stacy Fuller, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues.A Comcast blog post last week said that companies concerned about the FCC proposal include: set-top box maker Arris Group (ARRS), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Roku, as well as Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's NBCUniversal and Viacom (VIA).Scott Cleland, head of consultancy Precursor Group said: “The FCC would be giving Google access to most of the benefits and business value of their pay-TV competitors for free. The real story here is Google wants to add TV advertising as their next-most-coveted market to dominate.”

321,FOXA,"Wall Street is overlooking the ""unrecognized"" value of assets like Hulu in 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) current stock price, according to Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh, who raised Fox's price target to 38 from 34 on Wednesday. Like Netflix (NFLX), the online streaming service is a ""must-have"" for the modern digital consumer, he said.""After years of investment, we believe investors have lost sight of the potential payback from Hulu and STAR India,"" he wrote. ""We believe the two businesses can deliver meaningful profitability by 2020 ($1.5bn/$883m EBITDA respectively), and that visibility on this trajectory will become more apparent over the next 12 months."" Fox-owned STAR India is a 51-channel broadcaster that operates online streamer Hotstar.Hulu, which is jointly owned by Fox, Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA), gets far less attention than Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Video, though the over-the-top (OTT) service is growing at a quick clip: Hulu said earlier in 2015 that it has 9 million subscribers, a 50% climb from the previous year. But that still pales in comparison to Netflix's 69.2 million member base.Credit Suisse estimates that Hulu has lost $1 billion cumulatively at a net income level since it first launched in 2008, a loss which in the past year has been driven by higher programming and marketing costs.But it is now in a ""good position to grow strongly,"" said Sheikh. If Hulu can reach 37.5 million-42.5 million subscribers by 2020, it ""could justify valuations in the $12bn-$18bn range, with $15bn at the mid-point."" His analysis sees Hulu bringing in more than $1 billion in net income by that time.The online TV service — which streams currently airing programs from ABC, NBC, FOX and other channels, thanks to its traditional broadcast parentage — is seen as benefiting from its content offering, pricing and marketing strategy.""In particular, we think the service should benefit from the addition of an ad-free option; the expansion into commissioning original series; and more circumspect content licensing activity by big media owners to rival SVOD (subscription video on demand) services, including Netflix,"" wrote Sheikh.""Ultimately, we argue that Hulu will be a cornerstone OTT service for consumers — a 'must-have' digital subscription for cord-cutters and cord-nevers alongside Netflix and potentially (Time Warner (TWX)-owned) HBO NOW.""Sheikh has an outperform rating on Fox.Fox shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market Wednesday.

323,FOXA,"TV broadcasters and wireless phone companies are in store for a “spectrum extravaganza,” says FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, but others question whether the upcoming government airwaves auction will live up that billing.The Federal Communications Commission plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last as long as five months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum owned by local TV broadcasters.Wireless firms and other companies can file as bidders from Tuesday through Feb. 9.TV broadcasters need to be persuaded to relinquish their airwaves. The FCC has set opening prices in hundreds of markets, but bidders likely will end up paying less, under the auction’s complex structure.The deadline for broadcasters to file as auction participants was Jan. 12; the FCC has not said how many local TV stations, out of roughly 2,000 eligible nationwide, filed.The National Association of Broadcasters says it expects “robust” participation by local TV broadcasters. The rub, points out William Bird, an analyst at FBR & Co., is that broadcasters could walk away at any point.“There is little risk to participating since broadcasters may drop out of the bidding in any round if they decide the prices are too low,” he said in a research report.Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says it’s still unclear “how much spectrum will ultimately be auctioned.” Broadcasters have 120 MHz in all.In the wireless industry, AT&T (T)  and Verizon Communications (VZ) more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and also through walls, improving in-building services.The auction is an opportunity for smaller T-Mobile US (TMUS) to grab what Wheeler calls “beachfront spectrum.” Sprint (S) has said it will not bid, but parent SoftBank might, some analysts say.Observers speculate cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA) will bid for airwaves, most likely in local markets where it sells cable services, and perhaps an Internet giant such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.The last spectrum auction, AWS-3, ended in January 2015, and it raised $41 billion. The TV broadcast auction will have trouble matching that total, analysts say, unless dark horses such as Comcast emerge.“Without non-traditional bidders, the auction results are likely to disappoint broadcasters,” said a Moody's Investors Service research report.Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank have estimated Comcast could spend $4 billion to $6 billion in the auction. On the other hand, Charter Communications (CHTR), which is seeking regulatory approval to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks to become the No. 2 cable firm, is not likely to bid, analysts say.Both AT&T and Verizon have talked down their interest in the broadcast airwaves.
"
324,FOXA,"Verizon CFO Fran Shammo in October told analysts Verizon isn’t sure the TV broadcasters’ 600 MHz spectrum is a good fit with Verizon’s 700 MHz footprint because of potential interference issues.John Donovan, AT&T’s senior executive of technology, at a Citigroup conference in January said the low-band, 600 MHz spectrum might be better suited for rural areas than urban markets.These comments might just be pre-auction posturing, some analysts say. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates both AT&T and Verizon could spend at least $10 billion in the auction.The FCC, meanwhile, plans to set aside a large chunk of spectrum that AT&T and Verizon cannot bid for, a policy the agency says is aimed at fostering competition.Some 30 MHz of spectrum would be set aside for smaller carriers, if at least 70 MHz is put up for bid overall.The FCC’s Wheeler expects lots of action. At the consumer electronics show, CES, in early January, he said, “I think it is safe to say that you are going to see a spectrum extravaganza — that you are going to see lots of interest in selling the spectrum and lots of interest in buying the spectrum, and that is going to be transformational.”There’s disagreement over when the sold spectrum would be available for wireless firms. AT&T says not until 2020. T-Mobile says as soon as 2018 in many cases, because local TV stations will want to get paid.T-Mobile says it could spend up to $10 billion in the auction.The exact number of frequency blocks and licenses to be auctioned will not be set until broadcasters state their intentions. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacant TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use — a process called “repacking.”While local TV stations have the option of vacating all their airwaves and thus going off the air, most are expected to move to a new frequency band or share spectrum. Opening prices are meant to persuade TV stations to part with airwaves. Telemundo’s UHF station in the New York City market has the highest opening price, at more than $900 million.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar, in a report, forecasts that more airwaves will come from independent TV stations rather than local stations owned and operated by the four major broadcasters — Walt Disney’s (DIS) ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a potential seller of airwaves.
"
325,FOXA,"Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“On the supply side, we foresee potential robust participation from the major broadcasters, excluding ABC,” Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh wrote in a recent research note. “Sinclair, Media General (MEG) and Tribune Media have clearly vocalized their interest in the auction.“Nexstar (NXST), E.W. Scripps, and Entravision (EVC) have been less vocal on their strategy, and Meredith has stated it doesn’t believe a material opportunity exists for its footprint.”While other wireless carriers were little changed in the stock market Monday, Sprint plunged 12.2% to 2.52, ahead of its Tuesday-morning earnings report. The company has axed at least 2,500 jobs in customer care centers and at its headquarters since last fall, the Associated Press said in a Monday-afternoon report. Last week Sprint notified employees at six customer service centers around the country that it would be closing those locations or reducing the staff there, AP reported.

Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential.

Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend.

Shares of the trio fell hard on the earnings misses but recovered some lost ground by the end of the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported a 7% decrease in passenger unit revenue for July, saying the drop was in line with its expectations. But investors appeared worried about the tone the results set for the third quarter, during which Delta said the key metric of operating efficiency would fall 4%-6%. German carrier Lufthansa warned that terror attacks and economic uncertainty would affect travel also hurt the sector. Delta stock fell 2.8%. American Airlines (AAL) and  JetBlue (JBLU) also sank but United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) closed the week higher. .Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and WellCare (WCG) all put out estimate-beating quarterly results this week.

329,FOXA,"You're sitting courtside, close enough to that glossy NBA hardwood floor to high-five your favorite player. Look left, look right at the roaring crowd, and bask in the knowledge that your seat should normally cost thousands of dollars.But you're not in a maxed-out arena. Instead, the experience is taking place in the sun-bathed lobby of NextVR's Laguna Beach, Calif., office, where you feel like you're watching a basketball game from inside your television.This is the new wave of virtual reality. Not the clunky, pixelated virtual reality of yore, but one of live-streamed sports events, 360-degree news segments and interactive movie trailers in high definition that industry insiders say will deliver dazzling moments. So you can bet that old-school media heavies -- already beset by cord-cutting woes and the rise of streaming-entertainment leaders Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) -- want in on the action, which Digi-Capital estimates could be a $30 billion market by 2020.And despite no guarantees that virtual reality will have staying power as a new medium, the threat of losing more tech-savvy millennial viewers seems very real, giving Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Time Warner (TWX) and others a serious case of FOMO -- a Fear Of Missing Out.""It's kind of the perfect storm for VR to be rising at the time it is, because as you know, the media companies are all scrambling to figure out how do you get the millennials, the younger generation,"" NextVR Executive Chairman Brad Allen told IBD in an interview.Virtual reality has already gained traction in video games, with players heartily embracing goggle-based interactive gaming. Hardware is on sale now. Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation were among those showing off their wares at the VR-dominated E3 conference in June. But aside from video games, there is still little to watch with all that fancy VR gear. Enter big media.Comcast Ventures and Time Warner Investments were among those that contributed to last year's $30.5 million funding round for NextVR. The live VR broadcaster also recently inked deals with 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) Fox Sports and Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) as it looks to bring Daytona 500 races and A-list concerts to viewers who can't make it to those venues in person.In addition to NextVR, Comcast has plunked down millions of dollars in VR startups, such as cinematic content creator Felix & Paul Studios, communication platform AltspaceVR, and VR/mixed-reality company Spaces. Come August, Comcast-owned NBC will offer viewers 85 hours of immersive, Zika-free Olympics coverage via the Samsung Gear VR headset.If the scramble to throw money at VR is any indication, big media is taking it seriously. And while other new formats like 3D TV have come and gone, VR looks less like a passing fad and should stick around, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers.""It's not just going from HDTV to 4K TV,"" he said in an interview. ""It's not an incremental change. It's more a transformational change, so I think (big media is) trying to be at the forefront of innovation.""Watching TV in virtual reality is indeed light years away from a regular flat-screen experience. For one thing, it doesn't necessitate a TV, but a headset like Google Cardboard plus a smartphone app like Within or Jaunt. And the potential for nabbing a viewer's full attention is appealing, particularly at a time when young people are inclined to consume content on more than one screen at a time.Strap on a headset and disappear into VR segments from Disney's ABC News in which users can, say, wander through isolationist North Korea or watch a family of elephants lumber through the grasslands in Africa.In one video, ABC News reporter Bob Woodruff plays tour guide outside a replica Eiffel Tower on the outskirts of Shanghai. Glance to the sky, and there's the so-called Eiffel, one-third the size of the real thing and enshrouded in a mix of fog and pollution. To the immediate right is a pile of black sooty stuff, beyond which lies grass and the hazy outline of a few buildings.The video is technically a 360-degree experience and not what some would call ""true VR,"" in which users are able to move freely through the virtual space. Panoramic videos, such as ABC's, keep viewers rooted to the ground. In fact, much of what is termed cinematic virtual reality doesn't allow for mobility. You also can't talk to Woodruff or pet an elephant through some VR version of yourself, but that's not to say that such a capability won't exist somewhere in the future.Regardless, the technology is impressive, and the hardware projections alone are encouraging for those hoping the market will grow. Market tracker IDC projects sales of 9.6 million VR units and $2.3 billion in hardware revenue for the year, thanks to headsets from HTC, Oculus, Samsung and Sony, with sales ballooning to 64.8 million units and $15 billion by 2020.To be sure, the U.S. pay-TV market, which Deloitte estimates will hit $170 billion this year, dwarfs VR. But alarm over the subscription TV environment, spurred by flagging subscriber figures at Disney's ESPN, sent media stocks into a downward spiral last August and made the need to adapt to a digital-first entertainment landscape ever more pressing.Not long after the summer panic, it was announced that Disney had led a $65 million round of funding in Jaunt, a maker of cinematic VR recording equipment that also has an interest in content distribution. The startup's goal is to deliver VR to paying customers.""What we like to say is ... we're trying to be the Netflix of VR,"" Jaunt Chief Business Officer David Anderman told IBD.His aim is for viewers to shell out for ""premium, professionally produced content"" in much the same way that viewers subscribe to over-the-top streaming services.Like Next VR, Jaunt is focusing on sports, music and travel, plus news and documentaries. And Anderman said even gamers, who are among the early adopters in VR, are more interested in travel and adventure cinematic content than they are in games.""People try it, they have the ... 'holy crap' moment,"" he said. ""They can't believe the content they're seeing.""And in April, Nokia said it had forged an agreement with Walt Disney Studios to provide the company with VR cameras and software.The current array of content available is still somewhat spotty, though, and less often a standalone product than a marketing supplement for another show or movie.For example, embedded in Disney's ""Star Wars"" app is ""Jakku Spy,"" a string of VR transmissions to the sandy planet from the Resistance, designed to pump up enthusiasm last year for its long-awaited seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise.Meanwhile, shows like ABC's ""Quantico"" and USA Network's ""Mr. Robot"" have shot scenes in VR, and Syfy International is producing five exclusively VR episodes of ""Halycon"" that can be viewed through the Oculus Rift, in addition to 10 episodes for the linear TV network. (Both USA and Syfy are owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal.)Like media peers Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Lions Gate (LGF), Time Warner has also used a taste of VR to lure moviegoers back to theaters, such as Warner Brothers' VR trailer for its summer horror flick ""The Conjuring 2.""But some viewers, while enthusiastic about VR, are not always sure what to make of big media's efforts so far. Available on gaming platform Steam is Disney Movies VR, a collection of immersive experiences available to HTC Vive users. The hodgepodge includes VR scenes from ""The Jungle Book,"" as well as a 360-degree, red-carpet movie premiere that user reviews deemed ""underwhelming"" and ""painfully boring.""""Generally, all the studios are experimenting with the medium,"" said Piper Jaffray's Meyers. ""I think they're looking forward to VR being sort of the next medium to tell stories. However, I still think we're very early on. The filmmaking process, the storytelling process using VR is very limited at this point, so it becomes more of an experience.""It will be a while -- at least five to seven years away, says Meyers -- before audiences will be able to plop down into a theater seat and watch a full 90-minute to two-hour movie in VR. But exhibitors are already prepping themselves for VR-happy moviegoers anyway.Imax (IMAX) has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google to develop a cinema-grade VR camera, and through a partnership with VR content creator Starbreeze, plans to offer a ""premium VR experience"" in malls and multiplexes.""A lot of Hollywood is waking up to the reality that VR is gonna be huge, "" says Hrish Lotlikar, co-founder and chief business development officer of The Rogue Initiative.The VR entertainment company, which boasts alums from Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and elsewhere, recently struck a deal with Michael Bay of ""Transformers"" fame to create VR content in the director's signature action-heavy style.Content aside, there are several technical kinks that still need to be worked out.Capturing a moving, immersive environment while guiding viewers through a static narrative can be a difficult thing, and the entertainment industry is still in an ""experimental phase"" with the technology, said Meyers.Then there's the sheer cost of the hardware, not to mention the physical limitations of essentially being blinded to the real world by a bulky headset, which could turn off people who prefer the relative ease of augmented reality experiences like ""Pokemon Go.""But assuming that the industry can get it right, potential money grabs lay waiting. And as Hollywood works its way up the VR learning curve for feature-length content, other VR opportunities beckon. Hungry audiences abroad, for instance, might be willing to shell out for tickets for a Steph Curry virtual reality experience.""I don't think (VR is) ever going to replace going to an event ... but a lot of times people can't get there,"" said NextVR's Allen. ""The NBA has 300 million fans in China. ... Now all of a sudden, you have a virtual ticket, and there's a courtside seat that a million people could be sitting in, virtually.""

330,FOXA,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) scored 54 Emmy Award nominations on Thursday, an increase of 59% from last year's tally. Still, it trailed Time Warner's (TWX) HBO and 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) FX in total nominations.Premium cable channel HBO dominated the nominations on a network basis with 94 nods, but that was down from its record of 126 nominations at last year's awards. FX came in second with 56 nominations, up from 38 last year.Netflix's third-place ranking in nominations was led by 13 nominations for political drama ""House of Cards"" and six each for documentary ""What Happened, Miss Simone?"" and true-crime show ""Making A Murderer."" Comedy series ""Master of None"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" earned four nominations each.Last year, Netflix received 34 nominations and won four Emmy Awards. It was topped by Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Instant Video, which had 12 nominations and five wins. This year, Amazon earned 16 nominations.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock recently reclaimed its 50-day line and has been looking for support around that level since then. It and two other big name tech firms are testing key support levels. For more details, read Alissa Williams' in-depth analysis.Emmy nominations and wins are important for Netflix and others because they reinforce the idea that a service has high-quality content.The Emmy Awards, voted for by the 20,000-plus members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, are the top honors for U.S. prime-time television. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Sept. 18.Netflix needs compelling content to attract new subscribers and to keep existing subscribers on board, analysts say.Rounding out the top five for Emmy nominations this year, Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC came in fourth with 41, followed by Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC with 35.Netflix stock rose 1.7% to 98.02 in below-average trading volume on the stock market today.

331,FOXA,"Analysts forecast that Comcast (CMCSA) earnings will fall 3% from the year-earlier quarter to 81 cents in Q2, with revenue rising 1% to $18.99 billion, with intensified web TV competition ahead.Comcast reports Q2 earnings before the market open Wednesday. Consensus estimates have edged down the past week. Comcast stock hit an all-time high of 67.95 on July 12 and has been trading just below that level, closing Monday up a penny, at 67.47.For Q2, Comcast is expected to take a charge related to a life insurance liability settlement that could lower its earnings per share by three cents.Some analysts expect weaker results at NBCUniversal's film unit and in broadcast advertising. Comcast is expected to lose video subscribers in what's a usually seasonally weak quarter, though it may have benefited from a strike by wireline workers at rival Verizon Communications (VZ).During Q2, Comcast agreed to acquire DreamWorks Animation (DWA) for $3.8 billion. This month, Comcast and Netflix (NFLX) announced a deal to incorporate the video streamer's app into Comcast's X1 video platform.Comcast owns a stake in Hulu, a joint venture with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS). Hulu's losses are growing as it invests in content to compete with Netflix.Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, recently increased his estimate of Comcast's share of Hulu losses through 2017.AT&T (T) plans to launch a web TV service in late 2016.""Competition from online services is likely to increase in 2017, but we believe Comcast's product improvements position it to compete effectively against this,"" said Hargreaves in a research report.

332,FOXA,"ESPN parent company Walt Disney (DIS) has agreed to purchase one-third of Major League Baseball's digital business and take a four-year option to increase its stake to two-thirds, sources told Bloomberg.The reported deal would provide the media giant with access to an online streaming platform at a time when Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and other web-based programming have eroded its subscriber base.MLB Advanced Media, which handles online services from digital ticketing to sponsorships to live streams, says on its website that it distributes ""25,000 live events annually and 10 million streams daily,"" and that it has the resources to support ""millions of multi-platform subscribers and processes."" Paid streaming subscription services like MLB.tv and the WWE Network are MLB Advanced Media partners.The transaction with Disney is said to value the MLB company at $3.5 billion or so.Disney CEO Bob Iger has frequently been put on the defensive in recent quarterly earnings calls since last year's media market maelstrom, spurred by concern over the health of the pay-TV environment.But Disney, which also owns Marvel, Lucasfilm and the TV network ABC, appears to be exploring its online options.In the company's May earnings call, Iger told listeners that streaming service Hulu -- which it jointly owns with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal -- was an ""important investment"" and that Hulu's newly announced live-TV package was a ""best of cable approach"" between a skinny bundle and mega-cable package.ESPN has been bleeding subscribers, but its inclusion in streaming bundles -- such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and others -- could be linked to some ""very encouraging sign-ups,"" Iger said in May. Prior to that, he alluded in February to partnering ESPN with ""new platform providers.""Disney shares were up 0.2% on the stock market today. Netflix shares surged 5.7% on bullish analyst comments. Fox added 0.8%, and Comcast edged up 0.1%.

333,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ESPN is said to be in talks with Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and other online distributors to feature its sports content, according to The Street, citing people familiar with the matter.Further specifics weren't provided, and sources told the outlet that an announcement is not necessarily expected from the negotiations.Shares of Disney dipped 0.3% to 99.88 on the stock market today. Amazon, which reported strong Prime Day sales, slid 0.75%. Facebook fell 1%. Facebook once again undercut a 117.09 buy point and closed just above its 50-day line.For the last year, the sports cable network and Disney moneymaker has faced scrutiny over worries about viewer migration away from traditional cable packages, particularly as services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon Prime Video have gained steam.That has put Disney on the defensive -- and ESPN subscriber figures under the microscope. The media conglomerate has been exploring new platform providers for ESPN, and CEO Bob Iger said earlier in the year that Disney has seen positive signs from ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) PlayStation. Both platforms contributed ""incremental"" subscribers for ESPN in Q2, he said in May.IBD'S TAKE: Walt Disney stock has been in a downtrend. Not coincidentally, so has earnings growth. Investors should turn the dial over to CBS, which has accelerating earnings and is trading just below a 57.99 buy point. For a detailed analysis of CBS, see IBD Stock Checkup.And Hulu, the over-the-top programmer jointly owned by Disney, Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), said in May that it is preparing a live-TV package that will feature live sports and news among its broadcast and cable channels.

335,FOXA,"Mixed reality is about to get the ""Star Wars"" treatment. Walt Disney's (DIS) Lucasfilm ILMxLAB and Magic Leap announced a partnership Thursday at a Wired conference, teasing audiences with a mixed-reality video in which R2-D2 and C-3PO appear to be physically present in the room and fervently discussing how to escape a group of stormtroopers.Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Qualcomm (QCOM) were early investors in Magic Leap.Virtual reality and mixed reality (the latter layers projections on top of the real world) are still in early days, but legacy media entities clearly aren't hesitating to jump in. Disney also became an investor last year in cinematic VR company Jaunt VR, which consists of several Lucasfilm vets.Meanwhile, Chris Milk, the co-founder of VR startup Within (nee Vrse) announced Thursday — along with the name change — that the company was closing a Series A round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) also participated.Other notable media money in VR includes Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner's (TWX) investment units, which both participated in NextVR's $30.5 million Series A funding round last year.Does this mean that there are more partnership announcements to come? Maybe. VR is already a hot topic in gaming.At E3 2016 this week, virtual reality was a dominant theme. Microsoft (MSFT) teased its VR-capable Project Scorpio console, while Sony (SNE) gave PlayStation VR a formal release date, and Facebook's (FB) Oculus announced the release of 30 full VR games later this year.Shares of Disney finished 0.6% higher on the stock market today.

336,FOXA,"Time Warner (TWX) is gearing up for an epic battle this Sunday on HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" but it's Viacom (VIAB), Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) that are engaged in shuffles at the top.Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, which holds about 80% of Viacom's voting stock, said late Thursday that it would ax five members of the board, including current Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman.One of the affected directors, Frederic Salerno, has filed suit to seek ""an expedited determination that Shari Redstone's attempted removal and replacement of Viacom directors is invalid and that the directors elected at the 2016 Annual Meeting continue to serve.""Redstone has reportedly lost confidence in Dauman and the current board, but critics question the 93-year-old's mental soundness and whether his daughter and current board member, Shari, is pulling strings behind the scenes.""If the changes to the composition of the board are upheld in court, it seems clear that Sumner Redstone will at some point seek to replace Philippe Dauman as CEO of the company,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh.The five new directors include Buzzfeed Chairman Kenneth Lerer, former Sony (SNE) Entertainment President Nicole Seligman and former DreamWorks SKG co-COO and current Avis Budget Group (CAR) Executive Chairman Ronald Nelson.RBC upgraded Viacom to sector perform from underperform on the leadership shuffle.Viacom also issued guidance early Friday, with expectations of $1-$1.05 in per-share adjusted diluted earnings for the third quarter and 4% domestic ad sales declines. The outlook falls well short of current analyst views for $1.38 EPS.Viacom, which soared late Thursday on the board shake-up on hopes for a change in direction for the struggling cable and movie empire, closed down 1.4%.Meanwhile, Fox on Thursday named current Twentieth Century Fox Co-Chairman Stacey Snider as the new chairman and CEO of the movie studio, with current head Jim Gianopulos to step down on June 30, 2017, and transition to a ""strategic role,"" said the company in a statement.The move comes amid $250 million in anticipated cost cuts, announced in February, that reportedly includes staff reductions in Fox's TV and film units.James Murdoch, rose to succeed his father Rupert as CEO of 21st Century Fox last year. His brother Lachlan Murdoch serves alongside Rupert Murdoch as executive co-chairman.Shares fell 1.1% to 28.81 on Friday.Separately, Walt Disney's CEO succession plan is still murky after Tom Staggs stepped down in April as COO of the media conglomerate.

Apple shares fell 2.3%.
"
337,FOXA,"Shares of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), as well as many media stocks, rose Wednesday amid a broad market rally and the disclosure of first-round results of a government auction of radio spectrum now owned by local TV broadcasters.The Federal Communications Commission said that some 126 megahertz of spectrum will be available in second-round bidding, with a possible combined price-tag of $86.4 billion, based on prices for airwaves in local markets. In the first round of bidding, TV broadcasters agreed to give up spectrum for a set price.Some analysts, however, say wireless firms might be interested in bidding on only 60 MHz to 70 MHz of spectrum, which could lower auction proceeds substantially.  AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile US (TMUS) and cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) are among expected bidders. Upfront deposits are due July 1.Some auction estimates were as high as $60 billion in mid-2015, though most analysts have forecast spending in a range of $35 billion to $43 billion. But a different government spectrum auction that ended in early 2015 blew past estimates.The second round could start in late July, and could drag into Q4 or even later.For the complex, two-part ""broadcast incentive""  TV auction to succeed, supply and demand must be in sync. Wireless phone companies will bid for airwaves in specific markets, such as New York or Chicago.  TV broadcasters could walk away at any point if spectrum demand is too low or bid prices don't meet their expectations.Wireless firms, meanwhile, could hold off on bidding until less spectrum is up for grabs, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said in a research report.""While the 'shock value' of this ($86.4 billion) number is indeed high, we remind investors this number does not necessarily reflect what bidders in the forward auction (AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile) will bid to get this spectrum,"" wrote Fritzsche. ""We believe it is highly likely that the FCC will likely have to step to a lower clearing target (of around 60 MHz).""Wireless firms need airwaves for video streaming and other data services. If the auction falls apart for some reason, AT&T and Verizon would be better off than spectrum-needy T-Mobile, analysts say.Wednesday, Nextar Broadcasting (NXST) stock rose 6.4%, Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) stock rose 3.9% and Media General (MEG) stock rose 3.2%. All are possible spectrum sellers.Comcast-owned NBCUniversal has stated it might sell some airwaves.

338,FOXA,"Amazon.com (AMZN) has gained ground on Netflix (NFLX) in prime-time video streaming, while usage of Facebook (FB)-owned Instagram on mobile networks is booming, says Sandvine's new internet report.Facebook disclosed on Tuesday that Instagram, its photo- and video-sharing service, has grown to 500 million monthly active users, up from 400 million in September. Instagram's popularity is reflected in Sandvine's report on fixed-line and mobile data traffic released today.Instagram accounted for 6.7% of mobile data traffic in North America as of March 2016, up from 4.4% a year earlier -- behind Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube's nearly 21% and Facebook's 14%.Facebook -- along with Instagram and its WhatsApp messaging service, all combined -- topped Alphabet's YouTube with over 22% of mobile traffic.Privately-held Snapchat ranks fourth in mobile, at 5.2%, with Netflix at 3.7%, down a bit from a year earlier. Netflix's long-form content is less geared for mobile.Netflix's share of fixed-line data traffic slipped to 35.2% from 37% a year earlier, a decline that Sandvine, a broadband networking gear maker, attributes to the use of more efficient video transmission. YouTube ranked No. 2 at 17.5%.While Sandvine says Netflix usage has probably not peaked, rivals are gaining. Amazon's video streaming service accounted for 4.3% of fixed-line data traffic in March, doubling from a year earlier and overtaking Apple.Apple's iTunes store had 2.9% of streaming traffic while Hulu came in at 2.7%. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Sling TV, a Web-only TV service launched by satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), accounted for less than 1% of peak downstream traffic.Amazon shares fell 0.7% on the stock market today. Netflix lost 1.1%. Facebook and Apple retreated 0.4%.

339,FOXA,"Big changes are coming to Apple’s (AAPL) App Store.The policy change could be good news for Netflix (NFLX), Pandora (P), Spotify, Time Warner’s (TWX) HBO, Hulu and others that have iOS apps. Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Apple will take a smaller cut -- 15% instead of 30% -- from app developers that sell subscription-based apps, as opposed to one-time purchases, if customers renew after one year or sign up for multiple years.So said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in an interview with The Verge.Schiller's disclosure comes ahead of Apple’s Worldwide Developer's Conference. The Apple WWDC starts Monday and runs through June 17, in San Francisco.Currently, Apple splits app revenue 70-30 with developers, keeping 30% of the purchase price for itself. It’s called the ""Apple tax"" by some.If an app is sold as a subscription, developers who get customers to sign up for longer than a year will see an 85-15 split instead, as will developers that automatically renew subscriptions.“We recognize that developers do a lot of work to retain a customer over time in a subscription model, and we wanted to reward them for that by helping them to keep more of the revenue,” Schiller told The Verge.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) will offer even better terms to Android app developers, Recode reported. Alphabet's Google Play will offer the 15% model for subscription-based apps, but it will kick in right away, rather than after a year. It's unclear when Google will launch the new app pricing scheme.Apple stock edged down 9 cents to 98.94 by the close on the stock market today. Alphabet closed up 1.6% to 742.93, just above its 50-day moving average.

340,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) shares plummeted late Tuesday on a second-quarter miss, as the House of Mouse noted a decline in both ESPN subscribers and the sports network's advertising revenue.But CEO Bob Iger sees a ""very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront"" season ahead for both ABC and ESPN, he said during the post-earnings call.Shares sank 5% late, after closing the regular session up 1.2%.ESPN didn't consume the Q2 call as it did during the previous quarter, but Iger did say that the channel's inclusion in over-the-top bundles correlated with some ""very encouraging sign-ups.""Instead, focus drifted to Hulu, which has become an ""important investment for us not just as a distributor but as a buyer of original product,"" according to Iger, and he put Hulu's recently announced live-TV package as a ""best of cable approach"" that lies somewhere between a big, expanded bundle and lighter packages, such as those from Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling TV.Disney is ""fully aligned"" with joint Hulu co-owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) on a strategy for the over-the-top platform, he said, and doesn't foresee Disney having issues related to being both a content distributor and a content creator.The lookout for a successor to Iger's chief exec spot also came up, as Wall Street tries to anticipate who will take the helm of the media titan.Iger was mum on the circumstances of Tom Staggs' recent exit from the COO post, but confirmed that he has no plans to extend his contract beyond June 2018, when he is currently scheduled to step down as CEO.The board is ""actively engaged in a succession process as it has been for some time,"" he said, and the board believes it has ""ample time"" to identify a successor.The media conglomerate's Q2 earnings per share grew 11% to $1.36, excluding items, and revenue rose 4% to $12.97 billion, falling short of expected adjusted EPS of $1.40 on $13.19 billion in revenue.Media networks revenue, which includes the cable networks and broadcasting units, was ""relatively flat"" at $5.8 billion. Cable networks revenue fell 2%, while broadcasting revenue rose 3%.ESPN revenue rose, but advertising revenue notably decreased, and the company said affiliate revenue growth was ""partially offset by a decline in subscribers."" Iger had said in a February call that ESPN had experienced a slight uptick in subscribers in recent months.Studio revenue shot up 22% to $2.1 billion, bolstered by the theatrical success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the recently released ""Zootopia.""Parks and resorts revenue rose 4% to $3.9 billion. The anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort opens on June 16.Consumer products and interactive media revenues fell 2% to $1.2 billion.Notably, Disney shuttered its Infinity console games business, taking a $147 million charge during the quarter. While the company ""did quite well"" with the first iteration and ""OK"" with the second iteration, console gaming is a changing business that ""we didn't have the confidence"" to stay in, said Iger during the call, asserting that Disney was better off staying in licensing than publishing.RELATED:Verizon, Disney Bury The Hatchet Over ESPN, Skinny TV BundleWhat ‘Captain America: Civil War’ Means For Disney Ahead Of Earnings

341,FOXA,"Now that John Malone’s Charter Communications (CHTR) has closed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, analysts are focused on how much cash the new cable TV industry powerhouse will generate to boost shares.Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Charter could repurchase up to $5 billion in shares as soon as next year, on gains in its free cash flow — cash from operations minus capital expenditures, a key financial metric. But this estimate assumes the now No. 2 U.S. cable company will pause for breath after making its big acquisitions.“I would caveat this in saying that if Charter has other, more attractive opportunities to invest capital in growing its business either organically or through an acquisition, those opportunities would take priority,” Kraft told IBD.Charter could continue acquiring smaller cable TV companies, or even not-so-small Cox Communications, observers say. Charter might even team with Comcast (CMCSA) to acquire wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS), Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told IBD.Wlodarczak, though, is among analysts that say Charter stock repurchases are in the cards, in any case.""Malone is all about massive share repurchase activity and M&A where it is attractive,"" said Wlodarczak, noting that Liberty Global (LBTYA) and some other Malone-controlled companies have buybacks underway. In its Q1 earnings report May 9, Liberty Global said it plans to repurchase $3.7 billion of its shares by the end of 2017.JPMorgan credit analyst Michael Pace, in a recent research report, also speculates that the new Charter will buy back shares -- if acquisitions don't get in the way. “We expect the company to begin a stock repurchase program in the 2017 time frame, assuming no meaningful M&A opportunities arise,” Pace wrote.Former TWC shareholders own about 45% of the new Charter. Only 1% of TWC shareholders opted to take Charter’s higher cash offer when the deal closed, choosing instead to own more Charter stock.From 2010 through Q1 2016, TWC spent $20.7 billion repurchasing its own stock, says Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. That includes $1.32 billion in Q1. Charter bought back 12.7% of its stock in 2011, but that was before Malone took a big stake in the cable TV firm in early 2013.Malone founded U.S. cable firm Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1970s and convinced Wall Street to value high-capital-spending, debt-laden companies based on free cash flow rather than earnings. He sold TCI to AT&T (T) in 1998 for $52 billion.Charter’s $58 billion purchase of TWC closed on May 18, putting Malone back in the cable TV industry spotlight. Charter has morphed into the No. 2 cable TV firm, behind Comcast (CMCSA). Charter has about 21 million Internet customers and 17.5 million video customers. Charters rivals also include telecom leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T).Malone’s Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) owns about 18% of the new Charter and has 25% of the voting power. Media company Advance/Newhouse has a 13% stake in the new company.Besides TWC, Charter also acquired Bright House, for $11 billion. Charter has about $57 billion in debt on its books, a mix of investment grade and high yield, including about $21 billion of debt assumed from TWC.Fitch Ratings estimates Charter will churn out $4 billion of pro-forma free cash flow in 2016 and 2017. Moody’s Investor Service’s estimate is $2.5 billion “going forward.”Standard & Poor’s says it expects Charter to pay “minimal cash taxes until 2019.” How so? Charter, which exited bankruptcy in 2009, holds some $3 billion in net operating losses as well as other federal tax credits that it plans to use to offset future taxes owed. That’ll boost free cash flow, analysts say.The tax savings might last through 2020, says Morgan Stanley.A big question is whether Charter, described in 2013 by Malone as a “horizontal acquisition machine,” will keep shopping. Analysts say that asset swaps are possible among Comcast, Charter and Europe-based Altice Group, which is buying two U.S. cable companies, SuddenLink and Cablevision Systems (CVC). Approval of the Cablevision deal is pending, while SuddenLink closed near year-end.Charter CEO Tom Rutledge, in a Bloomberg interview, said he’s focused on integrating New York-based TWC and Syracuse, N.Y.-based Bright House into the company. “I think we’ll take a breather,” Rutledge said on possible M&As. “We’ve just gone through two years of transactions and regulatory approval. We don’t have any new transactions in mind.”A lack of M&As would hike chances of stock buybacks.UBS, in a March report, speculated that if Charter keeps its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at around four times debt, it’ll eventually be in a position to “fund the repurchase” of one-third of its stock float.Malone’s TCI and current Liberty group of companies has used free cash flow and debt to make acquisitions. Malone’s Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the biggest cable TV firm worldwide, with 24 million video subscribers in Europe and Latin America, where U.S. leader Comcast ended Q1 with 22.4 million cable TV subscribers.If Charter puts M&A on the back-burner, some analysts say Malone could consolidate some of his media assets or acquire more. Malone holds stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Federal regulators did not place any Malone-related conditions involving content providers on Charter's TWC acquisition.Charter, meanwhile, aims to lower the programming fees it pays to companies such as Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA). Those fees will amount to about $9 billion pro-forma in 2016, said Rutledge. With more subscribers, the new Charter should be able to hammer out better deals with content providers.Charter faces a decision on what to do with TWC's legacy sports networks, especially the channel carrying Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games. Other pay-TV providers have not carried the channel, in a long-running dispute.
"
342,FOXA,"Media titan Walt Disney (DIS) appears to be in pretty good shape heading into Tuesday's second-quarter results, as a super-team of theatrical releases continues to crush it at the box office.But as indicated by the previous quarter, investors may let their thoughts again drift to the Dark Side, as months-long hand-wringing over the state of the broader pay-TV environment just will not abate.Walt Disney investors were divided like the Avengers in Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War."" Shares rose as high as 106.68 early on the stock market today, moving past a buy point at 105.70. But shares reversed to closed down 0.2%.As of late Monday, Wall Street expects Disney to log 14% profit growth to $1.40 a share on a 6% revenue gain to $13.2 billion.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" should again prove to be a revenue-booster, with moviegoers choosing the seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise over newer releases in recent months.According to Box Office Mojo, the movie remained high in the box office rankings -- coming in at No. 14 over the April 1-3 weekend -- around the end of Disney's Q2 and close to four whole months after its big-screen premiere. The movie has so far raked in almost $2.1 billion worldwide.Disney's reign over movie theaters also includes the success of ""Zootopia"" and box-office leader ""The Jungle Book,"" though the latter counts toward the current quarter.Captain America has already pulled an estimated $181.8 million from its U.S. opening weekend, giving it a global box-office total of over $678 million since it debuted abroad in late April, said Variety. The film’s debut displaced “Iron Man 3” as the fifth-best all-time best domestic opening weekend.But the recent departure of Disney COO Tom Staggs - Iger's heir apparent - will likely prompt questions during call late Tuesday. And the question of ESPN’s subscriber data looms large.Despite a solid Q1 earnings and revenue beat on Feb. 9, lofty expectations and a hyper-focus on ESPN subscriber numbers dogged Disney shares the next day, with the stock sinking 3.8% on Feb. 10.Disney acknowledged previous subscriber losses but noted a more recent uptick amid the popularity of skinny cable bundles that include ESPN.Even if Q2 results top views, CEO Bob Iger may again get grilled about cable subscription figures, as he was during the previous quarter's earnings call.Why the persnickety attention to one sports cable channel amid a sea of products from the House of Mouse? For one thing, Disney's cable networks segment alone made up almost 30% of Q1 revenue (the greater media networks segment accounted for 41.5% of revenue for the quarter).By contrast, the studio entertainment unit only comprised 12.5% of Disney's overall Q1 revenue.""If (ESPN) looks more stable in the March quarter -- and management did say on last quarter’s call in February that Sling TV subs had helped overall subs tick up again -- then the DIS relief rally could continue,"" wrote Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen on April 26.""If there is any indication of weakness or further uncertainty at ESPN, or the cable networks in general, then DIS shares could struggle again.""More pressingly for the industry, the performance of Disney's cable networks might be taken as an indicator of the health of the greater media and pay-TV environment. It was, after all, comments about ""modest declines"" in ESPN subscriptions that helped fuel a media-stock meltdown last August.But Time Warner (TWX), CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) all reported solid earnings results over the past week, and Iger hinted in February that ESPN could come in more streaming forms.The sports channel is currently a member channel of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV, Verizon Communications' (VZ) Custom TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue bundles.""While we expect a messy quarter due to the timing of the college football games (Q1 vs. Q2 last year), we expect the cable affiliate revenue to grow 2.9%,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers. ""We do expect to see some upside from recent inclusion of ESPN into Verizon's Custom TV and Sony's Vue packages.""Lastly: Hulu, of which Disney is part-owner, might prove to be an interesting discussion point come Tuesday. The over-the-top service said this week that it is developing a live-TV package, which is reportedly expected to include ESPN.RELATED:Hulu’s New Service Could Give Netflix, Cable A Run For Their MoneyDisney CEO: ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel ‘Tailor-Made’ For StreamingDisney Lost More Subscribers In Q1 But Seeks New ESPN Platforms.

343,FOXA,"If media giant Time Warner goes on the block, cash-rich Apple (AAPL) has the money to pay.Time Warner (TWX) stock, as well as shares of video streaming leader Netflix (NFLX), rose Thursday on renewed speculation that Apple’s search for content might lead to a big acquisition.Netflix would cost Apple somewhat less than would Time Warner, though both would be huge deals. Time Warner’s market cap is about $58 billion, while Netflix’s valuation is near $43 billion.21st Century Fox (FOXA) aborted a Time Warner takeover in late 2014. AT&T (T), which Bloomberg reported on Wednesday will bid for Yahoo’s (YHOO) Internet business, also has been linked to Time Warner.Time Warner stock ended trading up 1.5% in the stock market today to 74.07. Netflix stock gained 2.6%.While the New York Post reported in January that Apple could make a play for Time Warner, the Financial Times on Thursday went a step further, reporting that Apple’s Eddy Cue, who oversees the iTunes store, had actually broached the idea in a meeting with Time Warner executives.Apple has reportedly shelved plans to offer its own Web TV service, which would directly take on Netflix and Hulu, amid stalled negotiations with media companies. Hulu is a joint venture of Fox, Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Some analysts have speculated over the years that Apple could chase after Disney. Buying the Mouse, however, would use up much up Apple’s cash, which Moody’s says surpassed $215 billion as of year's end. Disney’s market cap, though, is over $162 billion.

344,FOXA,"British statesman Winston Churchill never watched YouTube, nor was he a financial analyst. But Churchill’s quote that Russia “is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma” fits YouTube, the video website owned by Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.Ad-supported YouTube is a revenue juggernaut. Some analysts estimate sales will swell 30% to 40% in 2016, to about $9 billion.But is YouTube profitable? Google has never said. Nor does it disclose viewership data or other financial metrics beyond a few broad statements.“There’s substantial uncertainty, particularly over the profit levels at YouTube, whether it’s break-even or if they're doing modest operating margins,"" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney told IBD. “They have a lot of content royalty costs, massive bandwidth costs, storage costs, processing costs.""My guess is that with YouTube’s scale, they’re reasonably profitable, like double-digit margins, but there’s no way of knowing,” Mahaney said. He thinks investors crave a “clean look” at YouTube’s financials.Bank of America Merrill Lynch last year valued YouTube at $70 billion or more. That would be more than 40 times the $1.65 billion that Google paid for YouTube in 2006. BofA predicted YouTube's revenue will hit $13 billion in 2017.Its 1-billion-plus users and massive video library buoy Wall Street analysts' faith. They could place YouTube in a sweet spot to capture TV advertising dollars, as they shift to online video from broadcast networks and cable.But YouTube faces unprecedented challenges, as online video's burgeoning growth emboldens mighty competitors. Think Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX), among others.Broadcasters snipe at the quality of YouTube's videos, aiming to hold on to TV advertising. Competing in subscription-based services vs. the likes of Netflix and Hulu would take big content investments. Not knowing YouTube's costs, margins or growth history will make it hard to gauge how it's meeting the challenges -- and the potential for a blow to its value to Alphabet, whose overall market capitalization approaches $500 billion. Alphabet stock closed Friday at 747.60, up 1.5%.Costs already are rising. YouTube pays partners that generate traffic for YouTube. A popular site for music videos, YouTube is also renewing its agreements with major record labels. The Recording Industry Association of America in March charged that YouTube pays much lower royalties than Apple (AAPL) Music and Spotify.Observers speculate Google has sought streaming rights to on-demand TV shows and movies to bolster YouTube Red, its new subscription service. Some media reports suggest Google could go a step further and buy rights to live TV channels, making it a more direct foe of pay TV providers such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Google is usually mentioned when broadcasting rights to major sports are up for grabs.So far, though, this has all proved to be mostly idle speculation. Analysts say Google has not been bidding aggressively to win streaming rights. It's not clear whether YouTube, long the top video site overall in unique visitors, aims to be the No. 1 aggregator of all video, says Joel Espelien, an analyst at the Diffusion Group, a video-focused research firm.""YouTube's DNA is in free video with ads, and that's difficult to change,"" Espelien said. ""But also they don't want to be thought of as the cat video guys. They want the YouTube brand in a mass-market context. So they experiment buying rights.""But subscription VOD/premium video is different (than free). It's hit-driven. There's no HBO without 'Game of Thrones.' I'm not sure YouTube can monetize rights. There are questions over recouping content investments. If YouTube bought (live) NFL rights, they could lose their shirt.""It is, however, getting more aggressive with original content. YouTube plans to release 15 to 20 original series and movies this year. But its originals are not big-budget shows like Netflix’s “House of Cards.” YouTube’s originals are mostly spun off from a roster of young stars who have found an audience with their free videos on YouTube.YouTube has focused on developing online personalities such as video game player PewDiePie, music video specialist Smosh and style guru Michelle Phan. Driving much of the traffic to YouTube, analysts say, are multichannel networks such as Fullscreen, Maker Studios, SonyBMG and Whistle Sports. Google has bought stakes in multichannel networks such as Vevo and Machinima, analysts say, to ensure their content stays on its website.“One day YouTube will be as large as -- if not larger than -- most, if not all, legacy media companies,” Bernstein Research analyst Carlos Kirjner said in a research report. “It is playing a central role in the secular shift of brand advertising budgets to the Internet. Yet, we know ridiculously little about YouTube.”All the estimates by research firms and analysts, says Kirjner, are ""based more on belief and anecdotes than on truly representative data. What's more -- beyond anecdotes either shared by Google or collected through discussions with ad buyers, creators and multichannel network operators -- we know very little about what is available on YouTube, what people watch and how much it gets watched.""The lack of transparency is unlikely to change, says Espelien. While Wall Street craves granular data, it's not in Google's interest to say much, he says. Content providers and advertisers get ""little snippets"" of information from YouTube, but not most of the data YouTube collects.""There's information asymmetry,"" Espelien said. ""It's an advantage for them. Wall Street tries to model businesses and make forecasts, but that doesn't mesh with tech companies trying to preserve an edge.""Google's broad message? YouTube is doing well. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai put it on Alphabet's Q1 earnings conference call: “YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here.""The company does say YouTube has over 1 billion active monthly users, who watch hundreds of millions of hours of video each day, and that 80% of viewership is outside the U.S.Google also hasn’t said how many subscribers it's attracted to its ad-free, $10-per-month YouTube Red service. Google has launched a new 99-cent, three-month offer for YouTube Red -- possibly a sign it's not gaining traction.At an advertising gala in May, Google said YouTube now reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds on mobile devices than any network, including broadcast or cable. But it hasn't disclosed anything about what content they’re watching.What is certain is that Facebook and Amazon -- which offers its video streaming as one service in its Amazon Prime customer-loyalty package -- are taking aim at YouTube, as are Snapchat and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook and Twitter, via its Periscope service, are beefing up their live streaming, as YouTube does the same. YouTube in April began supporting 360-degree live streaming on its service.In early May, Amazon announced a new service initially designed for ""professional video producers."" Launch partners include media firm Conde Nast, the ""How Stuff Works"" website and Samuel Goldwyn Films. Amazon Video Direct could compete for the young creative talent attracted to YouTube. As does YouTube, Amazon offers revenue-sharing and royalties for content that attracts a certain level of traffic. YouTube has doled out bonuses to keep its top creative stars from defecting to Facebook or others. And holding on to popular multichannel networks such as Machinima, says Espelien, remains key. For now, YouTube's biggest threat is Facebook, says Mahaney. Facebook has hinted at creating a dedicated video service that would get prominent play on its social networking website. But even Facebook and Amazon can't easily match YouTube's scale, Mahaney says.""It's a long-term build for Amazon,"" Mahaney said. ""YouTube already has a billion people who go to it on a monthly basis. It's hard to see anyone matching them.""Facebook has users, too, but it's not purely entertainment, like YouTube.""Moreover, YouTube is best-positioned among rivals to tap into TV advertising budgets, some analysts say. That's because Google has worked to provide improved audience measurement tools.“Google is increasingly speaking a common language with TV advertisers on metrics that should drive increased share shift from TV to YouTube,” said Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente in a research report.Interpublic Group (IPG), the huge global ad firm, in April said it would shift $250 million in TV spending to YouTube. Toyota (TM) will increase its ad spending by 400% in 2016, YouTube says.In early May, YouTube said it would launch a new product that lets big brands automatically buy ads for the site's hottest viral videos.The new offering is an offshoot from Google Preferred, which enables agencies to reserve spots among YouTube's most popular channels. YouTube ad rates are higher for Preferred than its usual rates, says Espelien.""Along with Hulu, Preferred has the best pitch to TV buyers of any pure-play digital platform,"" said Daniel Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast.

345,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) missed second-quarter expectations late Tuesday, sending shares gapping down out of buy range Wednesday, closing down 4%.But is it all bad news? Here are a few takeaways from the media conglomerate's earnings call.IBD's Take: How sturdy is the House of Mouse? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFewer sports fans are paying for ESPN (again), but Disney's pay-TV situation is perhaps not as dire as once perceived, thanks to ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and on the Sony (SNE) PlayStation.""The numbers on both of those platforms have been encouraging, and they were a driver of (subscribers),"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said on the earnings call late Tuesday. ""They did contribute incremental subs for ESPN this last quarter."" He added that current and new distributors have an ""avid interest"" in including ESPN in their packages.Disney's 10-Q filing for the quarter notes subscriber declines having a 1% revenue impact to its media networks division, down from a 2% impact in its fiscal first quarter. Cable networks, (including ESPN and others) and broadcasting (including ABC) make up the media networks division.""These trends suggest some deceleration of subscriber declines, likely related to positive momentum coming from Sling TV and to a lesser extent Sony Vue,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to so-called ""skinny bundle"" packages involving a few select channels. Meyers reiterated his overweight rating on the belief that ""the upcoming film slate will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN.""Media networks revenue, which was flat from the prior year's second quarter, was ""largely in line (with my expectations) and, more importantly, largely in line on the affiliate (revenue) front,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, who rates Disney a buy.Revenue from both the cable networks unit and greater media networks segments slightly missed Wall Street consensus, according to Stifel, but analysts didn't seem to mind much -- in stark contrast to the previous quarter's call.Once in the shadow of Netflix (NFLX), Hulu garnered some attention in the wake of news that it will launch a live-TV package next year that will include broadcast and cable channels, as well as live sports and news.""Hulu's become an important investment for us, not just as a distributor of the programs that we make, but ultimately as a buyer of original product and ultimately as a distributor of our channels"" Iger said during the call, billing it as a ""best of cable"" middle-ground option between a bigger package and a Sling-style skinny bundle.The streaming service is a ""key strategic asset for Fox (FOXA) and Disney and one which allows for greater ad monetization over time but, more importantly, is expected to continue to bridge the product gap between MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) service and OTT (over-the-top) services,"" Mogil wrote in a separate note.Iger refrained from commenting on Disney's plans for subscription video-on-demand, except to say that it will keep investing in the creation of intellectual property.""One of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on two of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix,"" he said, adding that Marvel has also ""been in discussions"" with other distributors.Netflix shares were down 2.6% Wednesday.Separately, he said the value of Disney's IP in China ""is on the rise."" The soon-to-be-opened Shanghai Disney Resort will feature Marvel characters, and characters from the Disney animated film ""Zootopia"" will pop up in the park ""sooner than we had initially anticipated,"" said Iger, due to the movie's success in China.""In general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property, as well as a blend of some original intellectual property too,"" he said.Disney's IP flows through its various branches, as original characters become Disneyland attractions and toys that help the consumer products segment chug along.Spider-Man's return to the Marvel fold won't hurt, either. Marvel and Sony struck a deal last year to share the character, the top Marvel character from a merchandise perspective, said Iger. That means Disney probably expects fans to snap up Spider-Man toys and products next year when ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" hits theaters.

346,FOXA,"News that Time Warner (TWX) had considered a deal with Apple (AAPL) raises questions about its interest in investing in streaming service Hulu.Apple's head of the iTunes, Apple Music and iCloud businesses broached the idea of a buyout bid at a meeting late last year with Time Warner's head of corporate strategy, according to a Financial Times report. It comes as Apple looks for revenue growth in services to offset a slowdown in iPhone sales.Wall Street Journal reports from earlier in the year point to Time Warner being in discussions to acquire an equal 25% stake in Hulu, a platform that is jointly owned by Big Media triumvirate Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal. (CBS (CBS) has gone the solo route with its own streaming service, CBS All Access.)Traditional media entities have been facing increasing pressure from online pure plays such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). The concern over a threatened pay-TV environment has both taken a toll on media stocks (see: last August's media meltdown) and has prompted discussion of how Disney, Fox and others will evolve their streaming strategies.Shares of Time Warner finished trading up 1.5% Thursday to 74.07. Apple edged up 0.8% to 100.41. Disney ticked down 5 cents to 99.81, while Fox dipped 0.5% to 28.76, Comcast lost 0.5% to 62.29, and CBS added 0.8% to 54.35. Netflix climbed 2.6% to 102.81, as Amazon gained 0.9% to 714.91.The status of the Time Warner-Hulu talks is unclear, particularly since Hulu recently confirmed plans to roll out a live-streaming bundle in 2017 -- and Time Warner's reported objections to Hulu are that the streamer makes current-season episodes available online. The topic of whether to provide viewers with live or current TV potentially puts the two philosophically at odds.On Disney’s end, CEO Bob Iger remains both “very enthusiastic” about Hulu’s live approach, according to Variety, while also reportedly indicating that the company may not always choose to license content out to the likes of Netflix and Hulu down the road, according to MarketWatch. Both publications cited Iger’s comments from a recent investor conference.But investing in Hulu is the right call for Disney and Fox, says one analyst -- and it should be the right call for Time Warner, too.""We view Hulu as a key strategic asset for Fox and Disney and one which allows for greater ad monetization over time but more importantly is expected to continue to bridge the product gap between (pay TV) service and (streaming) services,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil on May 10.""Similarly for Time Warner, we continue to view Hulu as an appropriate investment/partnership for the company and do not rule out that possibility though the cost of entry likely continues to rise.""It remains to be seen whether Apple will continue to entertain the idea of acquiring a traditional media entity -- but such a major move would likely throw the media-sphere for a loop.

347,FOXA,"Media heavyweight Disney (DIS) reports its quarterly earnings just two weeks from now, and the stock is trying to retake a critical level in the stock market today.When Disney reports after the close on May 10, analysts expect earnings growth of 13% on a 6% revenue rise. Meanwhile, the company's ""Captain America: Civil War"" hits theaters on May 6. UBS expects $1.05 billion global box office receipts for the latest addition to the Marvel universe, and notes the flick has a high Rotten Tomatoes score at 97%.And with strong recent performances from ""Zootopia"" and ""The Jungle Book,"" UBS raised its full-year earnings estimate by 9 cents to $5.91.But even with a high-caliber film slate potentially contributing to a positive outlook for future quarters, investors will be looking closely – as in past quarters – at ESPN subscriber figures. Accelerated losses in that business segment have really impacted the stock.Disney shares corrected as much as 29% through mid-February, but are now trading 14% below their high reached last August. The stock climbed 0.3% in lighter than average volume in the stock market today. Disney attempted to retake the 200-day line but hit resistance at that level.Nomura Securities on Tuesday raised its price target on Disney from 110 to 115, in part due to ""theatrical tailwinds.""Disney’s strong content is also expected to benefit Netflix (NFLX), which has the rights to stream Disney movies. But Netflix investors were discouraged by a weak subscriber outlook for the second quarter.Netflix is now trading at a two-month low, about 30% below its December high. Shares fell 1.2% Tuesday.Elsewhere in the media space, CBS (CBS) is trading 11% below its May high, while Time Warner (TWX) is 15% below its July peak and Fox (FOXA) is 11% below its 52-week high.CBS reports its results a week before Disney, on May 3. Time Warner and Fox both release their earnings on May 4.

348,FOXA,"YouTube, the video website of Alphabet (GOOGL)-Google, aims to roll out a new paid subscription service called “Unplugged” that would offer customers a bundle of cable TV channels streamed over the Internet, says a report.The Bloomberg report comes after Hulu on Monday disclosed plans to stream live content from two of its parents, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS). Comcast (CMCSA), the third co-owner of Hulu and owner of NBC Universal, was not included in the initial plans. CBS (CBS) has its own stand-alone Web service to consumers.The Bloomberg “Unplugged” report notes that Google’s YouTube has not secured programming rights for the online video service. Speculation over YouTube “Unplugged” also comes amid a firefight over federal regulators' proposal to open up the pay TV set-top box market to more competition.Comcast, AT&T (T) and others object to the Federal Communications Commission’s set-top box proposal. They’ve charged that it might favor Google.The FCC says that only pay TV subscribers will gain access to programming, and that copyright protections will be preserved. Google, critics say, aims to swap its own advertising for the local ads sold by cable TV companies. Fox, Disney, CBS and Time Warner (TWX) have objected to the FCC proposal.According to the Bloomberg “Unplugged” report, YouTube has overhauled its technical architecture for the live product, slated to arrive as soon as 2017.Google last month introduced YouTube Red, which costs $10 monthly. It features movies, original content and other fare. Fox, Comcast-NBCU and CBS agreed to provide YouTube Red with content, while Disney did not.Hulu competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in the subscription video-on-demand sector. Dish Network (DISH) offers Sling TV, and has been gaining more content partners, including Fox.

349,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) video typically dominate the conversation about subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD services, but a new service from Hulu could be a game-changer that poses a threat not just to SVODs but to traditional pay-TV providers.The conglomerate-owned online streamer is developing a new subscription service that would include feeds of both broadcast and cable programs, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. The service, which appears to be akin to a skinny bundle, is looking to debut in the first quarter of 2017 and would cost around $40 a month, the Journal said.The new Hulu service would include channels such as ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, as well as Fox's sports channels, Fox News and FX, said the Journal. It also may offer cloud-based digital recording and an archive of on-demand shows.The move comes as traditional media conglomerates and pay-TV providers have been looking for new ways to appeal to viewers inclined to get their entertainment online. Dish Network (DISH) and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation each offer streaming bundles that include cable channels such as ESPN, TBS and CNN.Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) jointly own Hulu, and offer many of their popular shows on the platform, including ""Scandal,"" ""Empire"" and others.Following concern -- and an ensuing media-stock kerfuffle last summer -- over cord-cutters and the strength of Disney's ESPN subscriber base, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in February that the company was exploring new platform providers for the sports-cable network.As the major entertainment names begin reporting quarterly results this week, investors might expect more chatter about the SVOD environment and the performance of over-the-top services such as HBO Now and CBS All-Access.CBS (CBS) reports Tuesday, while Time Warner and Fox both report Wednesday. Disney reports next week.Netflix shares closed up 3.4%. Amazon shares climbed 3.7% while Disney shares added 1.1% and Fox gained 0.3%.

350,FOXA,"Dish Network’s (DISH) Q1 profit topped views, sending the satellite TV broadcaster’s stock up, as shares in Viacom (VIA) fell again amid stalled negotiations with Dish over a programming contract renewal.Englewood, Colo.-based Dish, which normally reports Q1 earnings in May, said that profit rose 11% from the year-earlier period to 84 cents a share. Revenue rose 2% to $3.79 billion, Dish said.Analysts had modeled EPS of 62 cents and revenue of $3.8 billion.Dish stock was up nearly 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 48. The satellite TV broadcaster’s stock is down 15% in 2016. Dish has been unable to find a buyer for its wireless radio spectrum or a wireless partner to offer mobile video services. Viacom stock, which fell 7% on Tuesday, was down about 2% late Wednesday morning, near 38.Dish said that it lost 23,000 net pay-TV customers in Q1. The company combines satellite TV customers with subscribers to its new online video service branded “Sling,” but it does not break out results.Dish lost 158,0000 satellite TV customers in Q1 but gained 135,000 Sling customers, estimated Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.While Dish aims to stabilize rising programming costs, its dispute with Viacom could increase subscriber losses, says Moffett.John Hodulik, a UBS analyst, agreed in a report.“DirecTV faced a similar dispute in July 2012, which kept Viacom networks off the air for 10 days, contributing to an 80% year-over-year drop in net adds in Q3 2012. While this is likely a negotiating tactic by Dish, since 2014 smaller cable operators, including Cable One and Suddenlink, have dropped Viacom’s networks entirely to save cost,” wrote Hodulik.Vijay Jayant, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a report: “We estimate that DISH pays Viacom between $350M and $400M in programming costs. While Dish will save these costs in case there is no agreement, it will also lose subscribers at a higher pace initially than in a scenario where there is a deal.  Dish also has an ongoing dispute with (Comcast (CMCSA)-owned) NBCU.”Viacom’s 24 cable networks include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Viacom lacks sports content, a strength of Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Dish has had disputes with CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox and Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit.Viacom rose more than 1% near 36 Wednesday afternoon after tumbling 8.3% on Tuesday.

351,FOXA,"The just-released ""Star Wars"" installment has already broken records, with North America ticket sales reaching $57 million for its showings Thursday night.But Disney (DIS) shares tumbled Friday after BTIG issued a bearish report. The analyst believes that ""The Force Awakens"" will boost Disney's fiscal 2016 results. But expensive sports content will drag cable-network profitability ""meaningfully"" below investor expectations in 2017 and 2018, according to the analyst.In late November, Disney reported big ESPN subscriber losses. The customer decline comes amid the millennial trend toward over-the-top streaming services like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu, a joint venture of Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC and Disney.BTIG downgraded Disney shares to sell with a price target of 90. The stock is currently trading around 108.Disney dropped 3.8% in heavy volume as the market sold off, breaching its 200-day moving average and hitting its lowest level in two months intraday. Last Friday, Disney dropped below the 200-day after Barclays warned that investors may be disappointed if the flick doesn't meet expectations.But is the force strong enough for Disney to overcome weak cable expectations? Some analysts say that the new ""Star Wars"" movie could become the No. 1 grossing film of all time.

354,FOXA,"At the end of every year, business journalists and Wall Street analysts sit down and write up their boldest predictions for mergers and acquisitions in the coming year. And like the people shown riding hoverboards in YouTube videos, they're likely to fall on their butts.Tech M&A predictions are often wrong because they're born out of wishful thinking. They ignore market realities, CEO personalities and other factors that can make such deals tough to pull off.But they're fun to consider. So with that in mind, here's a roundup of the boldest predictions for tech company mergers and acquisitions in 2016.Apple Buys Tesla MotorsApple (AAPL) is rumored to be working on an electric car and it could ""dramatically accelerate"" those efforts if it bought Tesla Motors (TSLA), says Aaron Task, digital editor at Fortune magazine.""With over $200 billion cash on hand, the iPhone maker has more than ample resources to absorb the purchase, especially now that some of the bloom has come off Tesla's once-rosy stock,"" Task wrote. ""In addition to its automobile know-how, Apple gets access to Tesla's battery, which CEO Elon Musk claims can help change 'the entire energy infrastructure of the world.'""Plus, Musk would be a worthy heir to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and would be ideally suited to be Apple's futurist, chief technologist and CEO-in-waiting, Task said.AT&T Buys YahooWeb giant Yahoo (YHOO) will be sold to telecom powerhouse AT&T (T), mirroring Verizon's (VZ) acquisition of AOL earlier in the year, predicts Chris Ciaccia, technology editor at TheStreet.""Yahoo's purchase of BrightRoll could help AT&T with its reported streaming service, as it seeks to have ads inserted into it,"" Ciaccia wrote. ""There are other players for Yahoo, like a media company or a private equity firm, but AT&T just makes too much sense to me.""GoPro Sold To Larger Tech FirmWith GoPro's (GPRO) stock depressed, a larger technology firm is likely to sweep in and buy the maker of action cameras, according to Orange Peel Investments.""With zero debt and $513 million in cash, the company has a clean slate for an LBO to come in, whisk them off their feet and take advantage of the company's ability to lever,"" the firm said in a post on Seeking Alpha. ""The obvious acquiring party in this transaction would be a larger technology or electronics outfit, such as an Apple, Samsung or Microsoft (MSFT). They could use the company's brand in a way similar to how Apple is using Beats. They could continue to have the brand name separate from the core brand and then eventually vertically integrate the two companies for future projects.""Comcast Will Try To Buy NetflixIn a prediction out of left field, Yahoo Tech editor Dan Tynan believes cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) will try to acquire Internet TV service Netflix (NFLX) or possibly vice versa.""Whether or not you're a cord-cutter, streaming media is the future of entertainment — and nobody streams bigger than Netflix, which accounted for nearly 40% of all Internet traffic last year. Since Big Cable can't beat the streamers at this game, the only thing left is for it to join them by acquisition,"" Tynan wrote. ""Comcast ($192 billion valuation) and Netflix ($42 billion) are the most logical candidates for an arranged marriage. While it stands to reason that the larger company will swallow the smaller one, it's not inconceivable that the reverse will happen — not unlike AOL's acquisition of Time Warner 15 years ago, but perhaps with better results.""Apple Buys A Movie StudioVariety magazine's writers and editors are predicting a lot of M&A activity in Hollywood in 2016. Most notably, they think Apple will buy a movie studio to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.""With more than $200 billion in cash on hand, the Cupertino colossus is poised to rewrite the rules of the media game,"" the Variety staff wrote. ""Viacom (VIAB) or HBO might seem the likeliest prey, but Sony (SNE) is a juicier target, given the mix of hardware and programming under its hood.""Variety thinks Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group (BABA) also is interested in buying a Hollywood player. Possible targets for Alibaba include Viacom, CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) and DreamWorks Animation.However, John Malone is most likely to snap up Lions Gate and merge it with cable channel Starz (STRZA), Variety said.Time Warner (TWX), parent of HBO and Warner Bros., could become an M&A target in 2016, Variety said. One likely bidder would be 21st Century Fox (FOXA), the trade paper said.Intel Or Qualcomm Buys InvenSenseU.K.-based research firm CCS Insight makes a lot of annual tech industry predictions, including some about mergers and acquisitions.It predicts that Intel (INTC) or Qualcomm (QCOM) will acquire InvenSense (INVN) in 2016.""The acquisition follows a large fall in the market capitalization of InvenSense in the second half of 2015,"" CCS Insight said in a report. ""Its purchaser recognizes the opportunity to snap up InvenSense's assets in sensor technology. As sensors take on greater importance in the Internet of Things and wearable devices, the buyer integrates InvenSense's technology into a wider range of semiconductors.""CCS Insight also predicts that Samsung will acquire chipmaker GlobalFoundries by 2017.""GlobalFoundries is currently struggling to compete against Intel, Samsung and TSMC (TSM),"" it said. ""Chip manufacturing becomes increasingly capital- and scale-intensive, with huge pressure on capacity as demand balloons for silicon for the Internet of Things. Samsung's foundry business accounts for a growing proportion of the company's profit, and the acquisition helps cement Samsung's position in this area.""Dish Network Gets MarriedDish Network (DISH) will merge with someone in 2016, says Phillip Swann, president of TVPredictions.com.""The nation's second-largest satellite TV service needs help to stay competitive, and that assistance can only come from a merger,"" Swann wrote. Possible merger partners include T-Mobile (TMUS), Verizon, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.""Out of full disclosure, I have predicted in the past that Dish will merge with someone, and it hasn't happened yet,"" Swann said. ""But this time, well, this time I really think it will happen.""RELATED:Apple 2016 Predictions: Acquisitions, Accessories.Cloud, Virtual Reality Among Top Tech Trends For 2016.

(Disney co-owns Hulu with Comcast (CMCSA) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA).)Be that as it may, ""The Force Awakens"" is not Disney's only hope. There is... another. Two others, in fact.

443,FOXA,"Not only are young adults more likely to ""cut the cord"" and give up pay-TV services, they're also more likely to switch among providers of Internet video streaming services, says a BMO Capital Markets report.The report cites data from TV ratings provider Nielsen.Young adults, oft-called called millennials, have been big users of Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com 's (AMZN) video service, and Hulu. Dish Network (DISH) and Sony early in 2015 launched over-the-top (OTT) services — so called because they piggyback landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet to stream video.Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to launch a new Web TV service. Apple's entry could spur some subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) users to switch, a trend already underway, says Daniel Salmon, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in his research report.""SVOD households generally churn at a higher rate than multi-channel video programming distributor (cable TV) households,"" Salmon said. ""We expect this is in part due to SVOD services' generally non-restrictive cancellation policies.""For example, over a three-month period, Nielsen generally finds that 99% of the households in the sample who had cable still have cable. However, 5-7% of people who had SVOD won't have it three months from now.""According to Nielsen data, 10% of persons aged 18-34 use only OTT services when they turn on a TV. SVOD users tend to watch less television overall.Among U.S. households, 41% now subscribe to a video streaming service, up from 36% a year earlier, said a Nielsen study released this year. Netflix by far is the most popular streaming video service, with Amazon No.2. Netflix stock recently got a boost when the company announced a 7-for-1 stock split.Another rival is Hulu — owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA).

Analysts had modeled EPS of 40 cents and revenue of $3.74 billion.While programming interruptions might have angered customers, Dish spent less on content than expected. Dish's contract dispute with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) ended in mid-January.Dish Network edged down a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 67.Net income nearly doubled to $351 million from $176 million in the year-earlier period, the company said.Dish had added 40,000 video customers in Q1 2014. Dish had 13.84 million pay-TV customers as of March 31, down slightly from a year earlier.

He expects financials in general and health care to have the strongest earnings growth of all sectors for this year.Signature Bank (SBNY) looks like an exception to Parton's concerns about regional banks.On Monday afternoon the New York City metro area bank was trying to reclaim a 154.50 cup-with-handle entry point.The bank, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, serves mainly commercial and high-net-worth clients.As of Sept. 30, 721 mutual funds held the bank, up from 630 at the end of 2014.Car-parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is up 38% this year.The chain store has expanded from its traditional customer base of do-it-yourselfers to more professional repair shops.Earnings per share grew 20% and 25% the past two quarters.Its most recent report beat analysts' consensus expectations.Revving UpThe stock was a top contributor to the fund's recent performance.Since an intraday peak of 277.96 on Oct. 29, shares have pulled back.

473,FOXA,"Apple's (AAPL) rumored pay-TV service, consisting of a skinny bundle of cable and broadcast channels, isn't likely to appeal to many consumers, UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a report Monday.Consumers like the idea of a less expensive pay-TV service, but not when it's missing some of the channels they want, Mitchelson said.Current skinny bundles are ""unpopular because consumers have a surprisingly wide variety of channel bundles that they prefer,"" he said.Skinny bundles such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue offer fewer channels for a lower price than regular pay-TV services.Meanwhile, over-the-top Internet television services like Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix (NFLX) typically supplement linear TV services by providing a selection of on-demand TV shows and movies.UBS reached its conclusions based on data from a survey of 1,855 U.S. pay-TV households. Its study sought ""to understand whether a la carte pay TV was viable (it is not), whether slimmed down bundles could prove to be popular (they are not) and the level of importance that each major media network group has to the bundle (all are quite important, including Viacom (VIAB), but some much more than others),"" Mitchelson said.Apple has been in talks with media companies over the past year about launching an online pay-TV service with a bundle of channels that includes live and on-demand video, to be paired up with its Apple TV hardware, Mitchelson said. Those companies include CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX). Apple has discussed offering a service costing $25 to $39.95 a month, he said.But media companies have been ""unwilling to let Apple cherry pick channels from their line-up,"" Mitchelson said.Content companies currently have little incentive to break up traditional pay-TV bundles. Cord-cutting, or pay-TV subscribers canceling their service, has not posed a big enough threat for content companies to change their business models, Mitchelson said.Also, media companies are mandating ""new entrant pricing,"" which is at a significant premium per customer than what the fully scaled traditional distributors have to pay, he said. ""Offering a healthy selection of high quality channels at a low price quickly becomes impossible under the constraints demanded by the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.Apple isn't the only tech company actively pursuing Internet-delivered pay-TV bundles, he said. Amazon.com and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google also are in the hunt, Mitchelson said.""In fact, Amazon and Google might beat Apple to market as Apple may be frustrated with the pricing and carriage demands of the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.UBS survey data indicate that Apple could be successful if it can pull together a compelling lineup of channels.Some 16% of U.S. pay-TV households surveyed indicated that they would consider signing up for an Apple TV service with 25 live TV channels (including CBS, ESPN and FX) costing $30 to $40 a month, Mitchelson said.""Not surprisingly, interest in the Apple TV offer skewed toward younger households, higher income homes, larger households and families with children, as well as streamers being significantly more interested than non-streamers,"" he said. ""Perhaps the most promising for media companies, among 18-34 year olds, 42% suggested they would definitely or probably subscribe to the Apple OTT service.""When asked to put together a custom bundle of channels, most survey respondents came up with bundles that would cost more than their current setups.The average custom bundle cost would be $127, 20% higher than their existing package, Mitchelson said. Only 28% of those who designed custom packages thought it was a better value, he said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves came to a similar conclusion — doubting Apple's prospects in the pay-TV realm — two weeks ago.""Odds may be increasing that Apple has decided the opportunity is not worth the effort,"" Hargreaves said in a Nov. 16 report.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

Higher domestic rates helped subscription revenue climb 4%.Subscriber revenue growth was ""weaker than expected"" but offset by better-than-expected content revenue growth, Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil wrote Wednesday.Media stocks, including Walt Disney, took a beating in August following the previous quarter's string of results amid concerns over subscriber growth and cord-cutting. Viewers are increasingly turning to Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Prime for entertainment. Netflix stock rose 3.9% during the regular session; Amazon advanced 2.5%.Time Warner's HBO dominated the Emmys in September with 43 wins, including 14 during the prime-time broadcast, besting every other network, including Netflix.The Q3 releases of games ""LEGO Dimensions"" and ""Mad Max"" boosted Warner Bros. revenue, which climbed 15% on higher video game and television licensing revenue. The TV results were helped by ""2 Broke Girls"" and ""Person of Interest"" licensing.Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox continued a streak of earnings and revenue declines, with a 3% year-over-year dip in per-share earnings to 38 cents, which topped Q1 views by a penny. Revenue fell 6% to $6.08 billion, short of estimates for $6.42 billion.Fox's cable networks segment delivered double-digit earnings gains on higher affiliate fees, ad revenues and lower expenses, CEO Rupert Murdoch said in a statement, but Q1 results also ""reflect the expected impact of challenging comparisons for our film studio due to the timing of key releases, as well as the poor performance of 'The Fantastic Four.'""Television ad revenues fell 5% due to one less week of NFL broadcasts during the quarter, though the television segment benefited from lower programming expenses.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Netflix: Will Media Firms Hint At Tougher Deals?Will 'Three-Headed Monster' Haunt Media Firms?

Dish (DISH) founder and CEO Charlie Ergen was careful making comparisons on the satellite broadcaster's Q1 earnings conference call Monday, but Ergen said he expects Dish's fledgling Internet over-the-top video service Sling TV to one day provide significant revenue.""We're excited about where it's going to go,"" he said. ""I think it's going to be meaningful revenue.""Dish Network, which lost 134,000 video subscribers in Q1, isn't ready to say how many customers have signed up for the $20 monthly Sling service, launched in January.Sony launched its own OTT service this year, while Verizon Communications (VZ) is ramping up a mobile video service.Apple (AAPL) could join the mix by 2016, some analysts say.Content providers HBO andCBS (CBS) have also launched Web-only services.The services are dubbed OTT because they piggyback landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet to stream video.""The (early Sling) results are encouraging,"" Ergen said. ""We're really encouraged with it. We don't think it's a flash in the pan.""Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, had 41.2 million U.S. streaming customers as of March 31 and only 5.6 million DVD-by-mail customers.Ergen concedes the conventional pay-TV market is mature. Dish had 13.84 million pay-TV customers at the end of Q1, down from 14.1 million a year earlier.Ergen says there are many technical and marketing challenges for Sling, which has suffered streaming setbacks during high-demand periods. Ergen says the economics of the streaming business are much different than broadcast TV.""This (OTT) is not as dramatic as perhaps what Netflix went through, but it's somewhat similar in the sense that when Netflix went from a DVD business in the mail to being able to deliver something instantly through the Internet, they started focusing on that (streaming) side of the business. I'm not saying that's going to happen here, but I do think that things like Sling TV are going to become more and more prevalent.""Ergen says that for the pay-TV industry, a generation of potential customers, millennials ages 18 to 34, are increasingly cancelling pay-TV service in favor of more affordable, on-demand content.Ergen expects pay-TV providers, including Dish, to continue adjusting the product bundles offered to consumers. Verizon recently sparked a fight with content firms, including Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN, over plans to offer consumers a new ""slim"" TV package for its landline FiOS pay-TV service.""Linear pay television business probably peaked a couple of years ago,"" Ergen said. ""But it's not declining as fast as I would have thought it would.""Ergen says pay-TV companies have gained some negotiating clout over content firms as consumers resist price hikes. Contract disputes with content providers contributed to Dish's Q1 subscriber losses as unhappy customers cancelled service. Dish's programming dispute with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) ended in mid-January.In Q1, Dish said it earned 76 cents per share as programming expenses and customer acquisition costs fell. Revenue rose 3.6% to $3.72 billion. Analysts had modeled EPS of 40 cents on sales of $3.74 billion.Average revenue per monthly pay-TV subscriber edged up 4% in Q1 to $86 from $82.36 in Q1 2014.Some analysts question Ergen's strategy of amassing radio spectrum with no apparent buyers of those airwaves — or a strategic wireless partner — in sight.In a recent airwaves auction, Dish achieved its main goal: securing licenses in major markets in order to pressure wireless firms such as Verizon or T-Mobile to negotiate, some analysts say.Ergen said T-Mobile remains a potential partner.""We're keeping all our options open, and we admire what (CEO John Legere) and his team have done with T-Mobile,"" Ergen said.

The online giant hopes that ""Community"" will raise interest about the no-subscription Yahoo Screen, which is airing more original content.A sticking point for rebooting Firefly may be getting the key players back together. The show had a large ensemble cast that has gone its separate ways. In particular, Nathan Fillion (Captain Mal on ""Firefly""), is the title character in ""Castle,"" on Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC.Fillion has made it clear that he would love to see ""Firefly"" return. He and co-star Alan Tudyk recently crowdfunded ""Con Man,"" which will be a series of 10-minute shorts about two actors on a sci-fi show canned too soon. Hmm...But could — or would — Fillion actually commit to a ""Firefly"" return?""Firefly"" also would be unthinkable without Whedon. He directed the hugely popular ""Avengers"" movie as well as the upcoming sequel. He apparently passed on making the next two Avengers films to avoid burnout. But it's unclear if the creator of ""Buffy,"" ""Angel"" and ""Cabin In The Woods"" would want to re-till old ground with ""Firefly.""Other Possible Cult-Hit Revivals?What other shows could get a (revenue) streaming or TV/streaming revival?* ""Chappelle's Show"" (2003-2006). The Viacom (VIA)-owned Comedy Central sketch comedy show (2003-2006) still gets good ratings in reruns. An ""event series"" could introduce Chappelle to a new generation.* ""Pushing Daisies"" (2007-2009). A critical hit, but a ratings bust. It's unclear if this sweet, quirky dramedy would generate huge buzz beyond its niche fan base. Also, Time Warner's (TWX) Warner Bros. owns the show, which means ABC would have no streaming incentive to air new episodes.

493,FOXA,"Discovery Communications (DISCA) stock jumped Monday on speculation that the multichannel television producer is a takeover target.A report late Sunday by the Australian Financial Review said that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) held preliminary merger talks with Discovery about two weeks ago. A Fox spokesperson responded to the article, saying, ""The story is categorically untrue."" Discovery declined to comment.The idea that Discovery might be in play excited Wall Street.""If the parties, as they maintain, are not talking, we think they ought to have a chat,"" Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in a research note Monday. ""We believe a merger between FOXA and DISCA would make strategic sense on a number of levels.""Discovery owns such channels as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Science, with such popular shows as ""Gold Rush,"" ""Deadliest Catch"" and ""MythBusters.""The combination of Discovery and Fox would create a dominant player in international cable networks, he said. It would allow for a natural combination of the Discovery Channel and Fox's National Geographic channels, as well as Fox's Sky Sports networks and Discovery's Eurosport in Europe, Juenger said.Discovery stock was up 5% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 32.50. It had been up as much as 9% in morning trading but has been in a downtrend since August.On Thursday, Discovery reported its first year-over-year decline in earnings per share in eight quarters. Sales growth was the slowest for the company in seven quarters.In the December quarter, Discovery earned 38 cents a share, down 7% from the year-earlier quarter, on sales of $1.68 billion, up 9%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for 41 cents and $1.7 billion.

548,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX) is bullish on its first feature film, ""Beasts of No Nation,"" which debuted on Oct. 16 and already has over 3 million views in North America alone, but the jury is still out on whether the company will continue to take on even more Oscar-level movie projects.The drama about an African warlord and child soldiers could set the tone for the other feature films in Netflix's pipeline, including Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler movies, among others. Here are three risks that come with Netflix's Oscar aspirations:AudienceNetflix is known as a binge-watching platform. Its subscribers enjoy watching a succession of TV episodes for hours on end. With its own original series, Netflix releases all episodes at once so viewers can do just that.Feature-length films are a different beast. The benefit of having series that people love is that they take longer to watch and keep viewers coming back, a Zack's Investment Research analyst recently noted. When you watch a movie, it's over after two hours.MoneyFeature films are also seen as a potentially bigger financial risk than a series because a series can be adapted to the reactions of viewers.Because ""Beasts"" was released on Netflix's site the same day it debuted in theaters, AMC Entertainment (AMC), Regal Entertainment (RGC) and others boycotted the film before it hit big and small screens, meaning stifled box office sales.But Rich Tullo, an analyst with Albert Fried, discussed the film's results after its initial weekend debut, saying a ""flop"" in theaters doesn't mean it's not popular online.""While the $51,000 box office seems like a huge flop it is possible that Beasts of No Nation may be popular on Netflix,"" Tullo said in a report last week.CompetitionAside from Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video service and Hulu (a joint venture between Disney (DIS), Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal), Netflix is facing increased competition from Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube Red paid subscription service and DisneyLife, a streaming app that's expected to soon debut in the UK.It Could Pay OffBut if Netflix can nab an Oscar with ""Beasts,"" that's one more accolade that may sway consumers to purchase a subscription.Jyske Bank said in an Oct. 16 research report that original movies, along with TV shows, are one of Netflix's strengths.Netflix's U.S. subscriber additions disappointed investors last quarter, so the fresh content, though not in binge format, could grab more attention.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter @IBD_AWilliams and Facebook.

"
551,FOXA,"Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris maintained his buy rating on AMC stock but cut his price target to 83 from 90.
"
552,FOXA,"Through the first two weeks of their current seasons, ""The Walking Dead"" (season 6) and its companion recap show ""The Talking Dead"" (season 4), have recorded declines of 15% to 20% in their core demographic of 18- to 49-year-old viewers, Morris said.
"
553,FOXA,"""While it is early and there are numerous factors to consider, we cannot overlook the importance of the franchise to equity value and risk of sustained declines,"" Morris said in a report.
"
554,FOXA,"One possible reason for the ratings declines has been competition from Major League Baseball playoff teams from large markets (New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles) and a marquee National Football League match-up last Sunday, he said.
"
555,FOXA,"""Despite our positive view of the company's expanding content offering, we believe ratings pressure on 'The Walking Dead' will weigh on overall reported ratings, and will ultimately temper ad growth,"" Morris said. ""Despite attractive underlying content value, we do not expect the public valuation multiple to expand without ratings growth. Sustained lower 'The Walking Dead' ratings are likely too heavy to be offset by new programming, in our view.""
"
556,FOXA,"He also trimmed his 2016 and 2017 EPS estimates for AMC to $5.60 and $6.48, respectively, from his prior $5.79 and $6.74, reflecting a lower advertising revenue forecast.

"
559,FOXA,"""While AMC Networks has been one of the fastest growing companies in the media universe, we are concerned about the company's reliance on 'The Walking Dead' franchise and see significant risk if viewership begins to decline,"" Creutz said.
"
560,FOXA,"He estimates ""The Walking Dead"" franchise, including the original series, talk show and spinoff show ""Fear the Walking Dead,"" account for nearly 25% of the AMC channel's total primetime viewership.
"
561,FOXA,"""This is a very comparable figure to American Idol's contribution to the Fox broadcast network's total season viewership as recently as 2011,"" he said. The subsequent ratings decline for ""American Idol"" was the primary driver behind declining earnings at the Fox TV segment over the last four years, he said. The Fox network is owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA).
"
562,FOXA,"""AMC could find itself in an even more difficult position than Fox has been in if 'The Walking Dead' were to start suffering a significant loss of viewer interest,"" Creutz said.
"
563,FOXA,"AMC found success with TV dramas ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" but those popular shows have ended their initial runs. Since those series premiered, competition for high-quality TV programs has become fiercer, with over-the-top Internet services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) entering the bidding, Creutz said.

He cited the company's overreliance on ""The Walking Dead"" for his cautious report.""While AMC Networks has been one of the fastest growing companies in the media universe, we are concerned about the company's reliance on 'The Walking Dead' franchise and see significant risk if viewership begins to decline,"" Creutz said.He estimates ""The Walking Dead"" franchise, including the original series, talk show and spinoff show ""Fear the Walking Dead,"" account for nearly 25% of the AMC channel's total primetime viewership.""This is a very comparable figure to American Idol's contribution to the Fox broadcast network's total season viewership as recently as 2011,"" he said. The subsequent ratings decline for ""American Idol"" was the primary driver behind declining earnings at the Fox TV segment over the last four years, he said. The Fox network is owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA).""AMC could find itself in an even more difficult position than Fox has been in if 'The Walking Dead' were to start suffering a significant loss of viewer interest,"" Creutz said.AMC found success with TV dramas ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" but those popular shows have ended their initial runs. Since those series premiered, competition for high-quality TV programs has become fiercer, with over-the-top Internet services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) entering the bidding, Creutz said.RELATED:Netflix Trails HBO In Picking Well-Reviewed Shows.

586,FOXA,"New Internet television services from Dish Network (DISH), Sony and possibly Apple are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers, Bernstein Research said in a report Thursday.The over-the-top video services announced or rumored so far are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in the report.His findings were based on comments made at focus groups in New York City and San Francisco. The groups were composed of people who identified themselves as ""highly likely to cut the cord in the next six months,"" as well as people who felt just the opposite.Based on the focus groups, Juenger is pessimistic on the prospects for Sling TV from Dish Network, PlayStation Vue from Sony (SNE) and a rumored Apple (AAPL) TV service.""A strong body of evidence is emerging that suggests to us that none of these services are likely to gain much traction,"" he said. ""Simply put, for existing pay-TV subscribers, the content is too limited (relative to the cost savings); and for cord-nevers, the price is too high (relative to the appeal of the content).""The OTT services are handicapped by having fewer networks in order to achieve a lower price, but not enough networks to make the service appealing.""Cord-cutting, in large numbers, isn't likely to happen,"" Juenger said. ""It's one of those ideas that sounds great in the abstract but crumbles when faced with the reality. OTT services seem poised to garner few subscribers, which is more good news than bad. We believe it's better for the pay-TV ecosystem to remain in the status quo than to add millions of OTT subscribers at the cost of blowing the whole system apart.""One of the big problems with ""skinny"" TV bundles is that individuals differ on what the ideal package of networks should be.Content Companies Cutting InAs Dish and others are putting together online programming bundles, some content companies are making stand-alone subscription video-on-demand services. These include Time Warner 's (TWX) HBO Go service, set to launch next month on Apple TV hardware; CBS All Access; and Nickelodeon's Noggin from parent Viacom (VIAB).Complicating matters even more are subscription streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu, which offer original programming as well as licensed TV shows and movies.The concept of over-the-top television is appealing because many people hate their cable TV providers but are stuck with them unless an effective alternative emerges.""The vitriol toward the cable companies was intense"" in the focus groups, Juenger said. ""A surprising number of participants are currently subscribing to pay-TV only because it is actually cheaper than buying high-speed Internet on its own.""Bernstein rates Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner as outperform.It rates AMC Networks (AMCX), CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) as market perform; and Viacom as underperform.RELATED:Apple building new set-top box for its Internet TV serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV service.

587,FOXA,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly will unveil a long-awaited revamp of its Apple TV set-top box this June, at the same event where it is likely to announce a subscription Internet TV service.Apple's next-generation set-top box will include a faster processor, a big increase in onboard storage and an improved operating system that can support Siri voice controls as well as downloadable apps from a new App Store, BuzzFeed reported Friday. Apple will release a software development kit and finally allow developers to write apps for the device, BuzzFeed said.Apple hasn't significantly updated the Apple TV box since a third-generation model debuted in March 2012. Apple has sold 25 million units of its streaming video box since it first hit the market in January 2007. The device allows owners to watch subscription video-on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu Plus and pay-per-view movies from Apple.It competes with streaming devices from Roku, Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and others.Last week, Apple cut the price of its current Apple TV hardware by 30% to $69. It also announced that it would be the exclusive launch partner for Time Warner's (TWX) new streaming video service HBO Now.Apple will announce the new Apple TV hardware and software at its Worldwide Developers Conference, tentatively scheduled for early June in San Francisco, BuzzFeed said. At the same conference, Apple is expected to announce a new subscription streaming music service, as well as an over-the-top Internet TV service to compete with cable offerings and new OTT services from Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE).Apple's Internet TV service is expected to launch in September with about 25 channels, including CBS (CBS), Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC broadcast networks. Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC would be offered as a separate subscription on Apple TV, not part of the basic bundle, according to news reports. The price for the Apple television service is rumored to be $30 to $40 a month.An Apple Internet TV service could accelerate Apple's path to getting 20% of its operating income from services in the next couple of years, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report Friday. Other Apple services include iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay and the Beats subscription music service. Services accounted for 14% of Apple's operating income in 2014, she said.""Just in the U.S., we see the potential for Apple to add 15 million subscribers to its TV service, or 8% of U.S. Apple users,"" Huberty said.

""We expect TWX will be successful with renewals.""Analysts say that the biggest content providers — such as Time Warner, Walt Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) — may have an edge over smaller programmers as pay-TV distributors look to lower programming costs.Pay-TV companies are shifting to slimmer programming packages, offering consumers fewer channels either in new ""over-the-top"" Internet video services or in ""broadband-first"" deals. To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, Comcast, Cox Communications and AT&T (T) have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery (DISCA) and other high-cost channels.Larger content firms have a better chance of having their cable networks included in slimmed down TV packages, analysts say. That's why Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS) are reportedly exploring a merger to gain more negotiating clout.""(Time Warner's) outlook for growth beyond 2015 appears much more reliant on a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth, which is likely to require successful renegotiation of the last two major domestic (pay-TV) deals and highly successful box office performance,"" said Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report. Time Warner owns the Warner Brothers film studio.Dish Network has rolled out a new TV Web-only offering called Sling. It's called ""skinny"" because the satellite TV broadcaster's Web-based offering includes only 12 channels, but for just $20 monthly.Dish's deal includes programming from Disney, Time Warner's Turner network, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and AMC Network (AMCX). Left out of the Dish Sling TV package were the big four national TV networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal — as well as cable channels from CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCU and Viacom.Some media firms plan to go it alone with their own Web offerings. Time Warner plans to sell HBO on the Webin 2015, and CBS has launched a subscription streaming service.

The base package includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN.

644,FOXA,"LAS VEGAS — For ultrahigh-definition television to really take off, the industry is going to need a lot of exciting UHD or 4K content that takes advantage of what the super-sharp new displays can show.But fear not, Hollywood studios and content distributors say more 4K movies and TV shows are on the way, including Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs likely by the end of the year. Currently, Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are leading the charge by offering 4K versions of their original shows on their subscription streaming video services.UHD TV is on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream, as consumers upgrade their big-screen sets to the better picture quality. UHD has four times the resolution of today's standard HD video.Victor Matsuda, global promotions chair for the Blu-ray Disc Association, said the group expects an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc standard to be locked down by midyear. Then consumer electronics companies and movie studios will begin using the standard in UHD products.""It would not surprise me to see some of the first products by the end of the year,"" Matsuda said during a panel discussion at the International CES on Tuesday.Meanwhile, a coalition of Hollywood studios, consumer electronics firms and content distributors has formed the UHD Alliance to establish standards for 4K video.Founding members of the UHD Alliance include DirecTV (DTV), Dolby (DLB), LG Electronics, Netflix, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony (SNE), Walt Disney (DIS), Twentieth Century Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Entertainment.Philip Goswitz, senior vice president at DirecTV, said establishing standards was his company's main motivation for joining the alliance. All parties offering 4K video products need to agree on quality standards to ensure a consistent experience for viewers. That includes standards for upcoming enhancements like high-data rate video.Movies tend to be among the first types of content to move to new resolution standards. But sports programming is what really moves consumers to adopt higher-definition standards, Goswitz said. ESPN parent Disney is a member of the new alliance.DirecTV is launching two new satellites to provide additional capacity for 4K channels, Goswitz said. One recently launched satellite is now operational and the other is going up in May, he said.Streaming video platform company Roku is ready for the 4K revolution, says Steve Shannon, Roku senior vice president of content and services.""We think 4K is a streaming platform,"" Shannon told IBD on Wednesday. ""If you look at the cable (TV) infrastructure, they're not going to be able to hop on 4K right away,"" because their set-top boxes will need to be updated.At CES, Roku announced plans to support 4K Ultra HD streaming in future Roku set-top boxes and streaming sticks. It also has prepared a reference design for 4K smart TVs for license to TV makers. Chinese TV manufacturer TCL has signed on as a customer for the 4K smart TV software.In addition, Roku is working with Netflix to provide 4K video for streaming on the Roku platform.Roku, which is widely expected to be one of the big IPOs in 2015, offers more than 2,000 streaming channels through its devices and supported televisions.

Live programming is viewed as a key asset to keep subscribers from switching to Internet video and on-demand TV services. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) launched a national sports network taking on Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN last year.Time Warner recognized losses tied to the Dodgers deal in Q3 earnings.""(Q3) customer results were strong, pricing improved, and profitability was stable despite investment spending and losses from the Dodgers (regional sports network),"" said Nomura Securities analyst Adam Ilkowitz in a research report.Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, said that Time Warner Cable's Q4 profit margins should improve.""While Q3 margins disappointed, management maintained full year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance of 3.75% to 4.75% growth, implying a healthy sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter. The improvement is driven by the absence of the Dodgers' rights fees, which are expensed over the baseball season, and a seasonal increase in high-margin political advertising revenue,"" McCormack wrote.

686,FOXA,"Momentum can shift quickly on Wall Street. A single trend or event sends some stocks or industries tumbling, while others get a shot in the arm and race higher.
"
687,FOXA,"Stock groups that fall into the latter category — share prices that have spiked considerably in recent weeks — feature a diverse mix of companies that range from Time Warner (TWX) and Walt Disney (DIS) to FedEx (FDX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Whirlpool (WHR).
"
688,FOXA,"Following are four stock groups that have made big moves over the past few weeks.
"
689,FOXA," Freight shippers: An improving economy, combined with falling oil prices, have created a positive operating environment for companies that deliver freight and packages for a living. IBD's Transport-Air Freight group ranks No. 11 out of 197 industries tracked — up from No. 49 four weeks ago and No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.
"
690,FOXA,"FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are far and away the biggest players in the group and boast IBD Composite Ratings of 94 and 91, respectively, out of a possible 99.
"
691,FOXA,"A couple of other stocks also have pretty high ratings: Air T (AIRT), with a Composite Rating of 89; and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), with a Composite Rating of 87. Composite Ratings factor in things like earnings growth and stock price gains.

"
695,FOXA,"For example, Time Warner's HBO premium channel recently said it will offer streaming-only HBO Go to consumers without cable subscriptions next year to help it compete against Netflix (NFLX).

"
696,FOXA," Medical supplies: Like the Media-Diversified group, IBD's Medical-Supplies group has made a big move the past few months. Thirteen weeks ago the group ranked No. 164. It has since vaulted to No. 19. The group's shares touched a record high on Monday and have risen 19% since the beginning of October.
"
697,FOXA,"Becton Dickinson, the largest stock in the group by market cap, saw its shares spike in October after it announced plans to buy CareFusion (CFN) for around $12 billion. Shares have since moved even higher for Becton, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 91.

701,FOXA,"The drop-off in TV viewership among young Americans is snowballing, says Nielsen, which recently called for new ratings measures that would capture viewing on digital streaming devices.Nielsen on Wednesday said viewership on ad-supported live TV fell 4% in Q3 for all audiences compared with a 2% decline in the June quarter.Online video streaming, while still smaller in terms of total consumption, jumped 60% as millennials flocked to Netflix (NFLX) and similar services.For TV broadcasters ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, trends are worsening for younger viewers, 18- to 24-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds, says Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Among them, he says, traditional TV viewing fell 14.2% in Q3 compared with 9% in the June quarter.""The scale of the declines among a few key groups accelerated, which is notable,"" Wieser told IBD.""While declines should level off eventually and viewing levels would certainly look better if tablets and out-of-home viewing were included in the data, a concern is that if reported viewing levels continue to fall at these levels, and if the industry is unable to generally make its case for why advertisers should use the medium, marketers who might otherwise have continued to focus their spending on TV may incrementally look towards other alternatives — namely, digital media at a broader level,"" he added in a report.Nielsen's ratings don't collect live TV viewing on Web-connected TVs, gaming consoles or tablet computers. Nielsen says a new standard should include all viewing.The average daily time spent watching live TV fell 4% to 4 hours and 32 minutes, says Nielsen. Online viewing rose 60% to nearly 11 hours monthly.Audience ratings also have been falling for cable TV networks. Cord-cutting — people disconnecting from pay-TV service — is a worry for Comcast (CMCSA) and other providers. Viacom (VIA) in November said it plans to explore ad revenue sources not tied to Nielsen ratings.Shares in ABC parent Walt Disney (DIS) edged down in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while CBS (CBS) stock was up 1.7%. Shares in 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast, which owns NBC, were roughly unchanged.

The firm also said that Facebook app Instagram, with its ""beautiful visual layout"" and ""highly engaged audience"" would make for a good advertising environment.Shares closed down 0.7% to 102.58 in the stock market today.Upscale grocery chain Whole Foods has struggled with its ""whole paycheck"" reputation, allegations that it overcharged consumers and competition from traditional grocery chains like Kroger (KR), which have pushed more aggressively into Whole Foods' turf by offering higher-quality fare.Whole Foods in September said it would lay off 1,500 workers, partly to keep prices lower and invest in technology.Whole Foods is trying to draw younger shoppers with less disposable income by launching a new chain of stores called 365 by Whole Foods Market.

756,FOXA,"Whether Netflix (NFLX) faces tougher access to content from big media and entertainment companies may be gleaned from what media executives say on their Q3 earnings conference calls.Netflix acquires much of its streaming content from Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox and CBS.Viacom (VIA), though, has steered away from new licensing deals with Netflix in the U.S. One worry for Netflix is that media firms will opt to license hit TV shows to rival Hulu — owned by Disney, Comcast and Fox — or to Amazon.com (AMZN).""We believe that the major media companies are increasingly at the inflection point regarding their views on SVOD (subscription video-on-demand) licensing, particularly regarding Netflix given its scale compared to the other services,"" said Benjamin Mogil, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, in a research report. ""As Netflix's subscriber numbers continue to escalate, we think there is increasing industrial logic for the major conglomerates to reduce their exposure to the service by reducing licenses.""Media stocks were torched in August after Disney warned about slowing revenue growth from affiliate fees, the payments that media firms garner from pay-TV companies. Those fees — based on how many pay-TV subscribers have access to cable channels like ESPN as part of basic programming packages — are at risk as consumers shift to watching on-demand content via the Internet.Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report that media firms might make a mistake by cutting off Netflix.""Would shutting off Netflix buoy the pay-TV business? Perhaps on the margin, but even if half the TV ratings erosion is due to Netflix, other players like Hulu and Amazon are investing to similarly build large streaming businesses that ultimately could take a greater bite out of TV viewership,"" wrote Swinburne. ""Arguably, YouTube and Facebook (FB) are larger threats to media earnings given what Netflix currently pays the ecosystem.""Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said some new content deals did trickle to Netflix in the September quarter. Netflix acquired rights to Disney/ABC's ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" as well as NBCU/USA Network's ""Colony.""""Time Warner and Fox (FOXA) have broadly discussed the notion of becoming more strategic around content licensing,"" said DiClemente in a report. ""Nevertheless, CBS, Disney and Comcast all licensed shows to Netflix in Q3.""Viacom recently expanded its relationship with Hulu and signed a new content deal with AT&T (T).CBS (CBS) is set to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Fox and Time Warner (TWX) on Wednesday and Disney on Thursday.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

"
790,FOXA,"Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne reiterated his overweight rating on Netflix stock and raised his price target to 135 from 125. Netflix stock rose a fraction to 113.45 on the stock market today.
"
791,FOXA,"Concerns that major media companies might stop selling TV shows and movies to Netflix are overblown, Swinburne said in a report Monday.
"
792,FOXA,"""There has been a change in tone among vertically integrated media companies around the net impact of Netflix on the ecosystem, raising concerns that Netflix's ability to access content from major studios will be diminished, reducing Netflix's growth prospects,"" Swinburne said. But he's not concerned.
"
793,FOXA,"For starters, Netflix is a major buyer of content, with spending likely to be over $6 billion next year. With subscription video-on-demand services like Netflix, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu spending big bucks on content, it would be difficult for studios to turn away that kind of money, Swinburne said.
"
794,FOXA,"Secondly, Netflix buys from vertically integrated media companies in the syndication window. And it is in the best interests of the studios and equity participants (such as producers and actors) to sell distribution rights to the highest bidder, he says.
"
795,FOXA,"Lastly, Netflix is becoming less reliant on acquired programming by making original TV series, comedy specials and other content. Major vertically integrated media companies will make up roughly 30% of Netflix's content spending next year, Swinburne estimates.
"
796,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS) likely will make up 11% of Netflix's 2016 content spending, followed by Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal with 8%, he said. Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) probably will account for 4% each, followed by CBS (CBS) with 3%.

Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the biggest cable TV player in Europe.""There are very few companies with a $150 billion market cap with so little of their revenue coming from outside the U.S.,"" Burke said. ""We see it as a huge opportunity. I think whether it's M&A activity or organic growth, international is a huge opportunity for us and it's something we'll pursue over the next five to 10 years.""Comcast also is building a $3.3 billion Universal theme park in Beijing with local partners.Burke said NBCU garners some 20% of revenue internationally. Discovery Communications (DISCA), with 51% of 2014 revenue outside the U.S., has the most international exposure. Fox (FOXA) garnered 33% of revenue outside America, followed by Time Warner (TWX) at 30%, Viacom (VIA) at 26% and Disney at 25%.

With prospects for video subscriber growth bleak, DirecTV Group (DTV) agreed in May to be acquired by AT&T (T).Much depends on the ability of Internet service providers to charge a premium for the fastest broadband connections, perhaps bundled with out-of-home Wi-Fi, analysts say.

1016,FOXA,"Major League Baseball's strategy for the Internet this year includes more games and more ad revenue.MLB.TV, the league's online service that shows live baseball games over the Internet that are not shown locally on TV, will provide its paid premium-plan subscribers with first-time access to the World Series, All-Star Game and some previously unavailable national games. It also plans to get more advertising revenue from the service.Making the games more accessible helps subscribers who aren't always in front of a TV set and those who prefer to view the action on smartphones and tablets, says Robert Bowman, chief executive of MLB Advanced Media, the unit that manages all of the league's online subscription services.""They might be on the go, they might be at a neighbor's house or they might be at an event and increasingly the younger fans are more comfortable with a personal device,"" he said. ""I'm amazed at the amount of video my son watches on his (Apple (AAPL) iPhone.""The list of new games available includes national games selected by Fox, a unit of 21st Century Fox (FOXA). For the first time, subscribers to the MLB.TV Premium plan can use the service to view Fox games not televised in their local market.MLB secured the rights in off-season talks with the TV network, Bowman says.""Those restrictions got lifted by Fox in certain instances, which was something important to us in the renegotiation of the national TV deal,"" he said.Adding more games such as the World Series and giving the fans the choice of what device they can use to view them is another way to boost renewal rates and attract new subscribers, says Jonathan Hurd, director for business consulting firm Altman Vilandrie & Co.""Consumers are so much now used to the idea of watching TV shows, movies and live events on tablets or computers that making the World Series available is a big positive for them,"" he said.MLB.TV Premium is MLB's most robust online product. The league sells the service along with a mobile application for $129.99 — the same price as last year but slightly more than the MLB.TV basic plan.MLB ended last year with more than 3 million total paid subscribers.With paid subscriptions growing at between 15% and 20% annually, MLB avoided raising the price while hoping to attract more fans, Bowman says.""We are going to do just fine economically with keeping the price where it is,"" he said.Raising prices is always a balancing act for companies, says Hurd, who is also an MLB.TV subscriber.""You want to come up with an overall value proposition and strike that balance between having more subscribers and maximizing revenue,"" he said.MLB's effort to attract more subscribers also extends to devices.This year, MLB.TV Premium subscribers can watch games via the Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One video game consoles. Both consoles debuted in November.That brings the total to more than 400 devices that can access the games via the premium package.MLB added Xbox One after the success of the Xbox 360, which reached 80 million in global sales last year, Bowman says.Another factor in MLB's favor is ad revenue.Ad revenue, particularly on mobile devices, is expected to rise as more companies target the two-minute gaps between innings, rather than promoting products in ads before and after games.""More advertisers understand the value of video,"" he said. ""We can serve video in stream, which makes it really popular with advertisers and not a pre-roll or a post-roll.""Subscribers are also less likely to become annoyed with ads that appear in between innings than before or after a game, Hurd says.""As a baseball fan I'm conditioned to the idea that once the third out comes I'm going to expect to see ads while I'm waiting for the next inning to start,"" he said.Most of MLB.TV's advertisers are the same national companies that sponsor the league's games on TV. But the regional aspect of the service also gives companies an opportunity to focus on specific areas or customers, Bowman says.""They may be a national sponsor like Subway but they might geographically target it based on some (ad) campaign they're running in Philly but not in Boston,"" he said.

In stage two, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new, Charter-managed public company.Charter would use stock to buy a 33% stake in the new company.

Comcast has also upped capital spending on its cable business, aiming to add Wi-Fi coverage in public locations, expand its network to reach more smaller businesses, increase broadband speeds and develop new digital technologies to deliver content to homes.Cable capital spending rose 10.4% in Q2 to $1.24 billion, and overall capital spending jumped 17% to $1.51 billion.Q2 is seasonally weak for cable TV companies because college students and homeowners who move disconnect service.Comcast's addition of 187,000 broadband customers and fewer video subscriber losses ""were particularly impressive considering heavy marketing from both AT&T (T) and Verizon during the quarter,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research, in a research note.Shares of Comcast have risen 21% in 2013.

Hulu's ex-CEO Jason Kilar, meanwhile, has obtained big backing for startup Vessel, a rival of Google's (GOOGL) YouTube.Netflix stock has been hitting new highs after the company last month reported big gains in international subscribers. Disney CEO Bob Iger says Netflix might be a partner more than a foe, amid big changes in the broadcast and cable TV industries, as viewing shifts to on-demand content. More young adults, in a trend called cord cutting, have been switching from pay TV to video streaming, posing a challenge for Comcast, Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) and other pay-TV providers. Satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV, acquired by AT&T in July, was among companies interested in buying Hulu in 2013.

1313,FOXA,"Roku on Wednesday introduced new models of its streaming TV player and additional channel content that includes a partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and Technicolor.
"
1314,FOXA,"Roku's founder and CEO is Anthony Wood, an entrepreneur who is now on his sixth company. Roku says more than 1,000 available channels are streamed through its Internet-connected box to TV sets.
"
1315,FOXA,"Roku was founded in 2002 and has received more than $140 million in funding from the likes of Menlo Ventures, Globespan Capital Partners, Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and Fidelity Investments. Roku sold its 5 millionth video player early this year and competes with the Apple (AAPL) Apple TV product and other streaming platforms.
"
1316,FOXA,"Wood recently spoke with IBD about the Internet TV market.
"
1317,FOXA,"IBD: Where is streaming TV headed?
"
1318,FOXA,"Wood: It's pretty clear that Internet streaming is the way all TV will be watched in the future. If we look at technology shifts and the distribution of TV, back in the day it was over-the-air TV. Then cable came along, and satellite and now the Internet as the next distribution scheme.
"
1319,FOXA,"We are in the middle of this transition. We've sold more than 5 million Roku streaming players, and that number is growing dramatically. We streamed over a billion hours of content last year. More and more content is becoming available through streaming. So the industry is going through this transition to Internet streaming distribution.
"
1320,FOXA,"And the advantages of streaming are that it gives consumers more choice. They can get Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), free content, subscription content, paid content; they have a lot of choice.
"
1321,FOXA,"IBD: So all video content will be streamed across the Internet?
"
1322,FOXA,"Wood: Yes, absolutely. You can see the beginnings of that through a deal we have with Time Warner Cable (TWC) . We have a TWC app on Roku. You don't need a cable box. You just run their app and have Time Warner Cable (for those with a TWC subscription).
"
1323,FOXA,"We have deals with HBO, something called HBO Go, where if you have a subscription you can run the HBO Go app on Roku and have access to their entire catalog of content. The pay-TV providers have great content offerings and are starting to deliver that through Roku.
"
1324,FOXA,"IBD: Won't this hurt the cable TV business, if everything streams?
"
1325,FOXA,"Wood: For companies such as Netflix and Amazon, it creates an opportunity to build multibillion-dollar businesses that didn't exist before. For incumbents like cable and satellite operators, it is creating opportunities to sell more broadband.
"
1326,FOXA,"I just upgraded my broadband from Comcast (CMCSA) because I stream a lot. Streaming TV is giving their customers more choice. So while cable companies have more competition than they faced in the past, they also have a lot of opportunity. We surveyed customers that use HBO Go and found they are significantly more satisfied with their pay-TV subscription. So even though pay TV has more competition, they also have an opportunity to create more customer satisfaction and loyalty.
"
1327,FOXA,"IBD: How will Roku become the operating system for smart TVs, as you plan?
"
1328,FOXA,"Wood: Think of a world where all TV you watch is streaming through your Internet. How that gets on your big-screen TV is an important question.
"
1329,FOXA,"Today there are several ways. There are game consoles, there are streaming players like Roku, and there are smart TVs with an Internet connection. If you look at how that is streamed to the TV now and the distribution of hours, gaming consoles are flat or declining. The two categories that are growing are smart TVs and streaming players. It's pretty clear that in the next few years most TV will be streamed and most of it will be streamed through a box or through the smart TV software built into your TV.
"
1330,FOXA,"We've spent a tremendous amount of effort building a software platform. We want to take our platform and move it into smart TVs. We haven't announced any products yet but we are in discussions with TV manufacturers to be the OS platform for their TV. There is a big opportunity here. There are a lot of smart TVs today but many of them only have a handful of streaming channels. We think we can make them much more compelling by bringing the Roku platform to smart TVs. We're making lots or progress on this, but we're not ready to make an announcement.
"
1331,FOXA,"IBD: How does Roku compare with Apple TV in market share?
"
1332,FOXA,"Wood: We sell roughly the same number of boxes. But Parks Associates recently surveyed 10,000 broadband households and found that the most popular streaming TV player by far in the U.S. is Roku. Apple was second. A lot of people apparently buy Apple TV for other uses. Apple has a great brand, but Roku has been very successful building up a brand and competing with Apple.
"
1333,FOXA,"IBD: Roku has far more available content than Apple. Why is that?
"
1334,FOXA,"Wood: One thing we did from the beginning was focus on getting as much content as possible on our platform. One way we did that is we published an SDK — a software development kit, where you can develop an app by downloading this SDK. Anyone can download this SDK from our site and write an app for our platform. So it's very easy to publish content to our platform.
"
1335,FOXA,"Apple TV did not take that approach. If you want to get on Apple TV you have to do a deal with them. And also they positioned Apple TV not so much as a platform but as an accessory for the Apple operating system.
"
1336,FOXA,"IBD: How does Roku make money?
"
1337,FOXA,"Wood: Roku has three businesses. We have our device business where we sell boxes, and that is profitable. And then we have our services business, which is our fastest-growing business. This includes services that help our partners promote their content. And we also have a revenue-sharing business that gets us a share of advertising revenue on channels.
"
1338,FOXA,"IBD: What can you say about the long-rumored Apple TV set?
"
1339,FOXA,"Wood: I don't have any information on that. But the rumor is really helping (our plan to have Roku as a smart TV platform). TV manufacturers realize they might need a much better software platform, one that can compete with Apple and Samsung's smart TV. Samsung has put a lot of effort into their smart TV. But I think that every other TV vendor besides Samsung is a candidate that Roku could do deals with. The TV business is very competitive. TV companies are trying to take costs down. We can offer them a streaming solution that is better than Samsung with no R&D costs.
"
1340,FOXA,"IBD: Is an IPO in your future?
"
1341,FOXA,"Wood: We haven't announced any plans but I think all companies like Roku would aspire to IPO someday.Roku on Wednesday introduced new models of its streaming TV player and additional channel content that includes a partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and Technicolor.Roku's founder and CEO is Anthony Wood, an entrepreneur who is now on his sixth company.

"
1366,FOXA,"Wood: Roku has three businesses. We have our device business where we sell boxes, and that is profitable. And then we have our services business, which is our fastest-growing business. This includes services that help our partners promote their content. And we also have a revenue-sharing business that gets us a share of advertising revenue on channels.
"
1367,FOXA,"IBD: What can you say about the long-rumored Apple TV set?
"
1368,FOXA,"Wood: I don't have any information on that. But the rumor is really helping (our plan to have Roku as a smart TV platform). TV manufacturers realize they might need a much better software platform, one that can compete with Apple and Samsung's smart TV. Samsung has put a lot of effort into their smart TV. But I think that every other TV vendor besides Samsung is a candidate that Roku could do deals with. The TV business is very competitive. TV companies are trying to take costs down. We can offer them a streaming solution that is better than Samsung with no R&D costs.
"
1369,FOXA,"IBD: Is an IPO in your future?
"
1370,FOXA,"Wood: We haven't announced any plans but I think all companies like Roku would aspire to IPO someday.Roku on Wednesday introduced new models of its streaming TV player and additional channel content that includes a partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and Technicolor.Roku's founder and CEO is Anthony Wood, an entrepreneur who is now on his sixth company. Roku says more than 1,000 available channels are streamed through its Internet-connected box to TV sets.Roku was founded in 2002 and has received more than $140 million in funding from the likes of Menlo Ventures, Globespan Capital Partners, Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and Fidelity Investments. Roku sold its 5 millionth video player early this year and competes with the Apple (AAPL) Apple TV product and other streaming platforms.Wood recently spoke with IBD about the Internet TV market.IBD: Where is streaming TV headed?Wood: It's pretty clear that Internet streaming is the way all TV will be watched in the future. If we look at technology shifts and the distribution of TV, back in the day it was over-the-air TV. Then cable came along, and satellite and now the Internet as the next distribution scheme.We are in the middle of this transition. We've sold more than 5 million Roku streaming players, and that number is growing dramatically. We streamed over a billion hours of content last year. More and more content is becoming available through streaming. So the industry is going through this transition to Internet streaming distribution.And the advantages of streaming are that it gives consumers more choice. They can get Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), free content, subscription content, paid content; they have a lot of choice.IBD: So all video content will be streamed across the Internet?Wood: Yes, absolutely. You can see the beginnings of that through a deal we have with Time Warner Cable (TWC) . We have a TWC app on Roku. You don't need a cable box. You just run their app and have Time Warner Cable (for those with a TWC subscription).We have deals with HBO, something called HBO Go, where if you have a subscription you can run the HBO Go app on Roku and have access to their entire catalog of content. The pay-TV providers have great content offerings and are starting to deliver that through Roku.IBD: Won't this hurt the cable TV business, if everything streams?Wood: For companies such as Netflix and Amazon, it creates an opportunity to build multibillion-dollar businesses that didn't exist before. For incumbents like cable and satellite operators, it is creating opportunities to sell more broadband.I just upgraded my broadband from Comcast (CMCSA) because I stream a lot. Streaming TV is giving their customers more choice. So while cable companies have more competition than they faced in the past, they also have a lot of opportunity. We surveyed customers that use HBO Go and found they are significantly more satisfied with their pay-TV subscription. So even though pay TV has more competition, they also have an opportunity to create more customer satisfaction and loyalty.IBD: How will Roku become the operating system for smart TVs, as you plan?Wood: Think of a world where all TV you watch is streaming through your Internet. How that gets on your big-screen TV is an important question.Today there are several ways. There are game consoles, there are streaming players like Roku, and there are smart TVs with an Internet connection. If you look at how that is streamed to the TV now and the distribution of hours, gaming consoles are flat or declining. The two categories that are growing are smart TVs and streaming players. It's pretty clear that in the next few years most TV will be streamed and most of it will be streamed through a box or through the smart TV software built into your TV.We've spent a tremendous amount of effort building a software platform. We want to take our platform and move it into smart TVs. We haven't announced any products yet but we are in discussions with TV manufacturers to be the OS platform for their TV. There is a big opportunity here. There are a lot of smart TVs today but many of them only have a handful of streaming channels. We think we can make them much more compelling by bringing the Roku platform to smart TVs. We're making lots or progress on this, but we're not ready to make an announcement.IBD: How does Roku compare with Apple TV in market share?Wood: We sell roughly the same number of boxes. But Parks Associates recently surveyed 10,000 broadband households and found that the most popular streaming TV player by far in the U.S. is Roku. Apple was second. A lot of people apparently buy Apple TV for other uses. Apple has a great brand, but Roku has been very successful building up a brand and competing with Apple.IBD: Roku has far more available content than Apple. Why is that?Wood: One thing we did from the beginning was focus on getting as much content as possible on our platform. One way we did that is we published an SDK — a software development kit, where you can develop an app by downloading this SDK. Anyone can download this SDK from our site and write an app for our platform. So it's very easy to publish content to our platform.Apple TV did not take that approach. If you want to get on Apple TV you have to do a deal with them. And also they positioned Apple TV not so much as a platform but as an accessory for the Apple operating system.IBD: How does Roku make money?Wood: Roku has three businesses. We have our device business where we sell boxes, and that is profitable. And then we have our services business, which is our fastest-growing business. This includes services that help our partners promote their content. And we also have a revenue-sharing business that gets us a share of advertising revenue on channels.IBD: What can you say about the long-rumored Apple TV set?Wood: I don't have any information on that. But the rumor is really helping (our plan to have Roku as a smart TV platform).

1373,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) battle for 61% stake of the European Pay-TV, Sky, escalated following higher bid from both the companies.Fox’s sweetened bid of $32.5 billion or £24.5 billion (£14 per share) was immediately retaliated by Comcast’s new higher offer of $34 billion or £26 billion (£14.75 per share) on Jul 11. The company’s latest bid is 18% more than its original offer.Fox’s offer is more than 30% above its first bid, submitted in December 2016, and now represents an 82% premium to Sky’s trading price at that time. Fox already holds 39% stake at Sky.Notably, the bidding war between the two U.S. media giants has positively impacted Sky’s shares, which are currently worth almost $35 billion or £26.6 billion, per Reuters.Why is Sky Important for Comcast and Fox?Sky holds significant value for both Comcast and Fox as they fight the growing dominance of streaming service providers like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon Prime. Comcast Corporation Price and Consensus Comcast Corporation Price and Consensus | Comcast Corporation Quote Sky operates in the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Italy, and reaches almost 22.5 million customers. Its popularity is primarily driven by offerings like the English Premier League (EPL) and Game of Thrones.Notably, Sky has the rights to show 128 EPL soccer matches for three seasons, beginning from 2019 to 2020.The acquisition of Sky will definitely boost Fox’s content portfolio. Fox, itself is in the mid of a bidding war between Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Comcast, and the addition of Sky will further boost its valuation.Meanwhile, Comcast’s interest in Sky is primarily driven by the fact that the acquisition will help it expand in the Western Europe. This diversifies its top-line source as North-American Pay-TV market saturates. The company’s Xfinity video revenues as well as NBCUniversal contributes significantly to earnings.Moreover, Comcast will be able to leverage Sky’s over-the-top (OTT) offerings. The company holds stake in emerging market OTT player iflix as well as platform and device provider Roku.Will Bid Price Rise Further?As noted by Reuters, the British regulators have indicated that “if Disney succeeds in buying Fox, including the 39% stake in Sky, it would be required to offer the same price for the remainder of Sky.” Hence, the bid price for Sky is expected to rise further.Reportedly, Fox has an edge over Comcast as it has agreed to sell Sky's news channel to Disney, as per the requirement of the British government. Moreover, Disney’s assurance that it will back any additional debt that Fox takes on to buy Sky will encourage the latter to counter the latest bid from Comcast.Nevertheless, Comcast is now expected to try harder for Sky’s assets, as a probable deal will help it gate-crash the ongoing Disney-Fox asset deal. Notably, Disney has secured conditional U.S. approval for Fox’s assets, which currently gives it an edge over Comcast.Zacks RankCurrently, Comcast has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while 21st Century Fox carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Disney has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc.

Per IAMAI report, given the availability of cheaper smartphones, faster connectivity and affordable services, the figure is estimated to cross 500 million by June 2018.Like other companies, Netflix and Amazon also seem to be cashing in on this. The strong growth prospect presents significant expansion opportunity for them.We believe continuous original regional content expansion coupled with competitive pricing will aid these companies in the long haul. Notably, per research firm Media Partners Asia, India's online video market, which is valued at more than $700 million, is anticipated to touch $2.4 billion by 2023.However, competition from Twenty First Century’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Star India owned Hotstar, Voot, SonyLIV and many other regional offerings poses significant threat.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderWhile Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Netflix carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) is a top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1375,FOXA,"Investors in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 20, 2018 $25.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Twenty-First Century Fox shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Twenty-First Century Fox is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Film and Television Production and Distribution industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 56 cents per share to 53 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Twenty-First Century Fox right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1376,FOXA,"The U.S. box office hit a record high of $3.3 billion in the second quarter thanks to summer hits like Incredibles 2, Avengers: Infinity War and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Moreover, the figures for June came in at an estimated $1.27 billion, the largest ever for the month, beating the previous record set in 2013, according to Hollywood Reporter.Franchise films have been driving the box office for quite some time and the second quarter wasn’t any different. At the same time it also proves that the appeal for theatrical movie-viewing experience hasn’t faded at a time when streaming giants like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are giving film studios tough competition.U.S. Box Office on Record-Breaking SpreeThe U.S. box office recorded its highest-grossing quarter ever, with revenues of an estimated $3.3 billion. The new domestic box office record surpassed the $3 billion record set in June 2015. Moreover, June 2018 was particularly the best month, posting revenues of $1.268 billion, up 19% year over year.Incredibles 2 topped the list, grossing $439.7 million, followed by Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which garnered revenues of $264.8 million. Avengers: Infinity War has been the year’s single biggest hit, raking in $672.5 million in revenues.Disney Leads the Race Yet AgainThe U.S. box office was once again dominated by The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in the second quarter. Disney was also the best performer in the first half of the year, making up for 36% of the overall yearly market share.As of June end, Disney made an estimated $2.2 billion in domestic ticket sales, 66.4% higher than the same period last year. June was particularly good for Disney, as the studio made $556 million from five films, led by Incredibles 2. Disney has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Other Studios Follow DisneyUniversal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), finished second in June, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom making $264.8 million. Time Warner, Inc.’s  Warner Bros. too tasted success with it franchise film Ocean’s 8, which has made $116 million so far.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the fourth-best performer although it didn’t have a release in June. However, the studio made $78.8 million last month, with another franchise film Deadpool 2 contributing 99% to overall revenues. Deadpool 2 has generated revenues of $311 million since its release in May.A Quite Place from Paramount Pictures, a subsidiary of Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), earned $187.1 million, 10 times the film’s budget. Another movie, Sicario 2: Day of the Soldado, from Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of Sony Corporation of America (SNE  -  Free Report), opened with $19 million in the last week of June.Price Performance Franchise Films ScoreThe success of franchise films was seen last year too, with Star Wars: The Last Jedi emerging as the highest grossing film. Moreover, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Guardians of the Galaxy and Sony’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, all franchises, took the No. 4, 5 and 6 spots in 2017.Understandably, all major studios will once again be banking on their franchise power in both the third quarter and the second half of the year. Analysts expect the box office to grow 4% year over year in the current quarter.Disney has Ant-Man and the Wasp, the last Marvel Comics’ film up for release in July, while Sony has Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. Universal’s Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again too releases this month.

1377,FOXA,"Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) upped the ante to $70 billion in cash and stock for key 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, one week after Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) outbid the company’s initial offer. Shares of Disney jumped over 1% on Wednesday following the news, which means now is a good time to see if Disney stock is worth buying at the moment.It is no secret why Disney wants this Fox deal. The entrainment power is in search of more content as it fights to remain highly competitive in the new streaming world driven by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Disney hopes to acquire Twentieth Century Fox’s film and TV studios; cable networks such as FX and regional sports channels; Sky in Europe and Star in India; and Fox’s one-third stake in the streaming service Hulu—which would give Disney a controlling stake in the streaming company.Disney investors likely don’t want to see this bidding war climb any higher. And there is no guarantee a deal gets done with legal hurdles looming ahead, even though some of the initial regulatory concerns seem much less relevant after a federal judge approved the AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  deal.Still, even if this deal doesn’t go through, Disney stock looks pretty strong at the moment.Fundamentals Disney’s portfolio already includes Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and its own studio, which should help it compete against the likes of Netflix when it launches its new standalone streaming service in late 2019. Coupled with ABC, ESPN, and its other cable networks, Disney will do just fine in the new entertainment age because live sports aren’t dying anytime soon—they are just changing.Meanwhile, unlike Netflix, Disney still makes box office hits and has the titles and brand names to roll out surefire money makers for years to come. This includes making a slew of live-action versions of many of Disney’s cartoon hits over the next decade. Furthermore, the company’s Parks and Resorts business continues to grow, with revenues up 13% last quarter to $4.88 billion.Investors should also note that Disney’s overall quarterly revenues climbed by 9% to $14.55 billion, while its free cash flow soared 48% to $3.46 billion. Therefore, Disney has the money to adapt to the new entertainment climate by spending on content, which, as HBO fans will know, is all that really matters (side note: Netflix’s total full-year fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to hit $16.13 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates).Recent Performance/ Valuation Shares of Disney have climbed 240% over the last 10 years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 129% climb. This upward movement also tops Comcast’s 238% surge as well as Fox’s 172%. However, the last few years have been less kind to Disney stock. Shares of DIS have sunk 5.5% over the past three years, and were down marginally since the start of the year, before today’s climb.Yet, Disney’s recent downturn has made its stock look like a steal. Coming into Wednesday, Disney stock was trading at 14.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500’s 17.2X. Over the last year, DIS has traded as high as 17.8X and as low as 13.4X, with a one-year median of 15.4X. Furthermore, investors will see that Disney stock is currently trading almost in line with its five-year low. Therefore, it is hardly a stretch to say that Disney stock looks rather cheap at the moment.Growth Outlook But a stock is only good if the company is expected to grow, which Disney looks poised to do. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for the company’s quarterly earnings to surge by over 29% to reach $2.04 per share—up $0.04 over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, Disney’s full-year earnings are projected touch $7.12 per share—up $0.19 over the last 60 days—representing a nearly 25% expansion.The company is also expected to see its quarterly revenues climb by 11.03% to hit $15.81billion, while its full-year revenues are projected to pop by 8.17% to reach $59.64 billion. Both of which mark small increases over the last couple of weeks and would be rather impressive for a company of its size and ageDisney is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “A” grades for Value and Momentum and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Disney has also earned seven full-year upward earnings estimate revisions, against zero downgrades, all within the last 60 days. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 1.6%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1379,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this episode, Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains breaks down World Wrestling Entertainment’s (WWE  -  Free Report) new TV deals with Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) USA Network and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). He also takes a look at WWE’s impressive growth, before he heads into some of the latest streaming sports news surrounding the NFL.Last week, WWE signed two larger-than-expected TV deals for its flagship weekly shows. Both five-year deals are set to start in October 2019, with USA Network ready to continue to televise Raw on Monday nights, and Fox set to air SmackDown on Friday nights on its broadcasting channel. Investors should also note that WWE’s weekly programming grabs huge viewership numbers that place it in the same company as the NBA.On top of that, the wrestling entertainment company’s streaming service, WWE Network, has performed well and has helped its stock price surge roughly 260% over the last year.Fox stepped up its live sports offerings with this new deal, along with a $3.3 billion Thursday Night Football contract, amid its current acquisition talks with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Comcast. These moves come at a time when live sports rights are more valuable than ever due to the rise of the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Hulu.Moving on, CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and the NFL just recently announced an expansion of their streaming agreement, which now includes game streaming access via mobile devices for CBS All Access and paid TV subscribers. The deal is significant since mobile streaming rights had previously been exclusive to Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is hoping the second season of its Thursday Night Football streaming coverage will perform better. Investors should also remember the e-commerce power beat out the likes of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Going forward, these big tech giants, along with Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and others are set to spend big to shake up live sports programming.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1380,FOXA,"The knockout stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Saturday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Telemundo. With half of the original 32 teams eliminated and ratings up, World Cup drama is really just beginning. So let’s see how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed, along with a quick look at the TV ratings.RatingsThe early World Cup ratings on Fox were down 44% compared to the 2014 tournament on ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), saw a comparable drop. This downward trend then quickly flipped.Germany’s June 23 stoppage-time victory grabbed 5.4 million viewers on Fox, which made it the most-watched non-U.S. men’s group stage game on English-language TV in 28 years. Other games also grabbed big numbers, with viewership on Day 14 up 34% compared to 2014.Fox noted that its overall group stage viewership was up 1%, compared to the average of the last four World Cups. This might not sound like much, but many expected Fox’s ratings to suffer since the U.S. did not qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.Meanwhile, overall TV ratings are down, including the NFL’s. So with that said, let’s quickly look at how these integral parts of the tournament in the U.S. have performed on the stock market.Fox & TelemundoFox and Telemundo won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. Both networks also own rights to the 2026 World Cup that will be held in North America.Sponsors Now let’s move onto some official FIFA partners and World Cup sponsors, which reportedly pay between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 8.4% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 82% climb.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since it signed its new FIFA deal. However, it is worth noting that the company’s surge currently lags rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) climb, which is also a major player at the World Cup in terms of team and player sponsorships.  Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1381,FOXA,"The Dow endured a turbulent week, marked by lingering trade tensions. The blue-chip index also closed below its 200-day moving average for four consecutive sessions. Conflicting signals emerged from the Trump administration on trade issues. These mixed signals led to a significant spike in volatility, with the index whipsawing during several trading sessions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.5% last Friday, reversing an eight-session long losing streak. This was the blue-chip index’s longest stretch of losses since March 2017 and was just one day short of its all-time longest losing streak since 1978.Gains were primarily attributable to an energy sector rally following the meeting between OPEC and Russia led consortium that took place in Vienna on Jun 22. Finally, OPEC decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia.The index declined 2% over last week, its largest weekly decline since Mar 23 as well as its second straight weekly fall. The Dow declined modestly on last Monday, as trade war fears once again escalated making investors jittery. However, markets ended sharply lower on last Tuesday, as trade war fears escalated once again.Growing fears of a U.S.-China trade war continued to take its toll on the Dow on last Wednesday and Thursday. Markets were further rattled after a Supreme Court ruling on sales tax saw shares of online retailers tumbling.The Dow This WeekThe index shed 1.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop since May 29, closing at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union continued to weigh on investor sentiment.The index gained 0.1% on Tuesday but still ended below its 200-day moving average for the second straight session.  Investors reacted cautiously as the U.S. government continues to provide mixed signals on the ongoing trade conflicts.On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering restricting Chinese investment in high-tech U.S. companies. On Jun 25, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin first tweeted that the WSJ published “fake news”. However, he later clarified that restrictions will apply to all countries including China if they try to steal proprietary tech assets of U.S. companies.The Dow lost 0.7% on Wednesday, closing at its lowest level since May 3. The blue-chip index ended 165.52 points lower after touching an intraday high of 285.91 points. This reflects the index’s largest intraday downslide since Feb 21. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average for the third straight session.Markets opened on a positive note as President Trump stated that he has decided to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), who will assess potential threat from Chinses investment in U.S. companies. This was a softer stand compared with Trump’s earlier decision to impose China specific investment restrictions.Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated the government can block any American joint venture in China if the firm transfers critical technologies to China.Moreover, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration’s revised approach related to Chinese investment in the United States should not be considered as a soft stand on China. Following these two developments, stock markets took sharp downturn.The index gained 0.4% on Thursday, ending 98.46 points higher are dropping 100 points earlier in the day. Gains were largely broad-based with banks and tech stocks rallying strongly. Shares of JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) each gained more than 1%.Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) gained 1.5% to emerge as the best performer for the blue-chip index. Despite the recovery, the index closed below its 200-day moving average for the fourth session in a row.Components Moving the Index Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 financial earnings of $0.69 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share.

The company’s CFO, Robert Swan has been appointed as the interim CEO.Realizing the gravity of the matter, the chipmaker cleverly timed the resignation announcement with a revision in guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

1383,FOXA,"Shares of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE  -  Free Report) moved sharply higher in morning trading Wednesday after the company inked larger-than-expected TV licensing deals for its flagship weekly shows.WWE signed new agreements with Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) USA Network and 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports, which will both become effective on Oct. 1, 2019. USA Network will continue to distribute “Raw” as it has for several years, while “SmackDown” will move to Friday nights on Fox.Both deals are five-year agreements. Together, they will increase the average annual value of WWE’s domestic TV distribution to more than 3.5x that of its current deal with Comcast’s NBC Universal.WWE said it expects revenue from the deals to increase from $311 million in 2019 to $462 million in 2021. That would mark growth of roughly 48.5% over that two-year stretch.Investor reaction to the deal underscores the importance of TV distribution for WWE—even as the sports entertainment company continues to push its own over-the-top streaming service. WWE Network, which features live main events like “Wrestlemania” as well as unique original content, currently boasts about 1.6 million average paid subscribers.“Raw” and “SmackDown” are weekly shows which create and advance storylines between wrestling characters in the run up to main events. “Raw” has been on air for two-and-a-half decades and is the longest-running weekly episodic TV show in American primetime history.WWE shares opened higher and quickly touched an intraday peak of $74.72—about 12.2% above Tuesday’s close. The stock has since fallen from that high, but WWE is still on pace to book a solid gain today.Wednesday’s trading adds to WWE’s solid momentum. The company has seen share prices more than double so far this year as investors have gobbled up rumors related to its now-official TV deals.The sports entertainment brand has also been busy expanding its live event empire. WWE hosted a massive, 60,000-person show in Saudi Arabia this April through a special agreement with the Saudi government, and it plans to hold another seismic event at Australia’s famous Melbourne Cricket Ground later this year.Analysts have also become more bullish on WWE’s earnings outlook recently, with our consensus projection for its full-year EPS figures moving eight cents higher over the past two months. WWE is now expected to report earnings growth of 41.5% in fiscal 2018.Want more market analysis from this author?

1385,FOXA,"Today’s big pre-market news involves a new bid from The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) to take over assets from 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), for $38 per share, or $71.3 billion. Reports are the offer would split the payout 50/50 between cash and stock. This outbids Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) offer last week to pay $35 per share for Fox assets, all cash.This deal has been in the making for more than half a year now, with the previous bid from Disney amounting to $28 per share. Seems a pittance now, especially considering that Comcast may come back with an even better offer, perhaps even bringing a new deal into the $40 per share range or higher. “Content is king,” of course, and in the timeless words of Mel Brooks, “It’s good to be the king.”FOXA shares jumped 6% almost immediately on the news, and after selling off a tad subsequently, has now ratcheted up nearly 8% currently. Year over year, Fox is up roughly 73% — and if a bidding war is indeed in the offing, we’re not done with these increases yet. Disney stock is also up at this hour, about 2.25%, and even Comcast is up by 4 cents right now.Disney and Fox have a longer relationship in place regarding content development, but no one seems to think this deal is over. Even representatives at Disney — and even after hearing news that Disney CEO Bob Iger and Fox CEP Rupert Murdoch dined together last night, according to CNBC’s David Faber — don’t believe Comcast is finished pursuing these assets. Stay tuned!Elsewhere, reports that Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is cutting sales forecasts has sent shares falling more than 3.5% in today’s pre-market. The retail coffee giant is also planning to shutter 150 stores in the next year, in what appears to be a plan to increase comps in existing stores. Starbucks stock is down 7% year over year, and has only met earnings estimates in three of its last four quarters.Also, Starbucks is one of the companies most often cited as potential collateral in a trade war between the U.S. and China. As China cannot match us tariff for tariff because they import less than 4x the goods from the U.S. than we import from their country, companies that do significant business in China — Yum China (YUMC  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), for instance — may face boycotts or other, shall we say, “anti-growth” measures.Some potentially good news on global trade? Germany has proposed lifting its 10% EU tariff on autos imported to the U.S. Defenders of President Trump's trade philosophy may point to this and say his method is working. But is Germany expecting anything in return, other than planning to flood the American market with Volkwagens, Audis and Mercedeses.

1386,FOXA,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) hit a new all-time high on Wednesday after the company’s photo-sharing app Instagram rolled out a new long-form video feature. The move helps demonstrate just how important video has become, and shows why fellow social media firm Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) looks like a strong buy stock at the moment on the back of its own live video push.Instagram launched its new IGTV yesterday that allows users to upload hour-long video content, up from its previous one-minute limit, in a move that seems aimed at taking on the likes of Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube and Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). But while investors decide if they are ready to jump back into Facebook stock, despite its recent data scandal woes, it’s worth diving into why Twitter stock is worth buying (also read: Should You Buy Facebook  Stock At New All-Time High?).Live Video Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Now while these user figures don’t come close to matching Facebook or Instagram, the company’s video-based initiatives are in full-force and benefit from every added user.Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts last quarter and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships, including deals with the likes of Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—featuring a ton of ESPN programming and a FIFA World Cup partnership.Twitter’s push into streaming sports, which is one of the last things people need to watch live, is also expected to pay off. The company now has partnerships with MLS and MLB for live games, after experimenting with the NFL’s Thursday Night Football.The @OrlandoCitySC take on the @NewYorkRedBulls this Saturday, and you can watch the full match right here on Twitter!Follow @TwitterLive to see what else is streaming all week long. pic.twitter.com/hIVrjRwJqt— Twitter Live (@TwitterLive) March 26, 2018The key here is that live video attracts more advertisers, and like Facebook, Twitter makes most of its money from advertising. The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Price Movement Moving on, some investors might be shocked to see that the previously struggling social media company has seen its stock price skyrocket over the last year. Coming in Thursday, shares of Twitter had soared nearly 151% over the last year, which not only crushes the S&P 500’s 14% climb but also tops Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 74% surge. Narrowing the focus, TWTR has climbed roughly 46% over the last three months, which tops Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) 36% growth. Investors should also remember that despite Twitter’s strong year-long run, the company is still well below its all-time high that it reached shortly going public in 2013. This means it might have an easier time keeping its current streak alive, especially considering it is expected to expand its bottom line significantly.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 112.5% to touch $0.17 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to soar by 70.5% to reach $0.75 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 11 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 14 upward revisions for fiscal 2018, with almost 100% agreement.The company, which had struggled to grow its top line, is projected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Bottom LineTwitter is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 23.1% over the next three to five years. Therefore, Twitter stock might be worth considering at the moment.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1388,FOXA,"On Jun 20, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in a not-so-surprising move sweetened its bid to acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, surpassing Comcast Corporation’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) all-cash offer of $65 billion made last week.The latest development has certainly taken the media acquisition war to a new level. And in doing so, it definitely has paved the way for consolidation in the industry, at a time when online streaming giants like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are fast invading its space and changing the entire ballgame.As the mouse and the peacock continue their chase to catch the fox, it won’t come as a surprise if Comcast too in the coming days raises its bid. And amid all this drama, one person — Rupert Murdoch — is only getting richer.  Disney Replies to Comcast’s ChallengeFox on Wednesday accepted Disney’s fresh offer of $71.3 billion to acquire its film and television assets. The new offer is not only $18.9 billion higher that its first bid made in December, but also $6.3 billion more than Comcast’s  all-cash offer of $65 billion made last week.The new bid has definitely put Disney back in the reckoning. Fox too has been more inclined toward Disney, as the deal has more regulatory advantage, with greater opportunity in terms of approval compared to Comcast.Interestingly, after placing a $52.4 billion offer to buy out Fox, Disney in Dec 2017 had said that it was a “definitive agreement.” The scenario started changing in May when Comcast said that it will make a counter bid to acquire Fox’s assets.However, Comcast was waiting for the all-crucial judgment on AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) $85 billion bid to acquire Time Warner Inc.  after the Justice Department had sued to block the merger. Comcast finally placed an official bid on Jun 13, a day after a federal judge cleared the way, allowing AT&T to acquire Time Warner.Streaming Giants Intensify the Convergence War It now won’t come as a surprise if Comcast makes a fresh bid in a tryst to derail Disney. Fox definitely is an important buy, as acquiring Fox means a lucrative portfolio comprising its film studios, a group of cable networks that include FX, National Geographic Channel and Star India, alongside a one-third stake in Hulu and 22 regional sports networks.However, the bigger is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money. Acquiring Fox means it will create a new mass that will allow both Disney and Comcast to take on streaming giants like Amazon, Netflix and YouTube.Expanding International FootprintBroadcasters are trying to expand their international presence and acquisition seems to be the best weapon. The recent judgment in favor of AT&T will allow the mobile-phone giant to directly compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. At the same time, it will also allow the AT&T to create fair competition among cable operators and increase the cost of visual entertainment, thus consolidating the entire media ballgame.Similarly, Disney, which has been struggling to make its presence felt in India, will get the Star India network in its arsenal if the Fox deal falls through. Understandably, the acquisition war is a survival strategy. Amazon and Netflix are taking the game away from traditional broadcasters, with television becoming almost obsolete. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing UpDisney may have thrown the challenge back at Comcast but the bigger story definitely is the growing footprint of streaming giants. This has made traditional broadcasters and film studios struggle and expand their international presence through acquisitions; and penetrating the streaming space seems the only way to survive.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1389,FOXA,"Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) just announced its new $70 billion offer for an array of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, outbidding both Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) unsolicited deal and its initial offer. Disney’s bid represents a large amount of money even for the historic entertainment giant, so let’s take a quick look at the latest deal before we dive into why Disney wants it so badly.Fox OverviewFox and Disney entered into a definitive, $52.4 billion all-stock agreement in December. Last week, Comcast offered roughly $65 billion in an all-cash offer to acquire the same Fox assets.Disney and Comcast both plan to buy Twentieth Century Fox film and TV studios; cable networks such as FX and regional sports channels; two major satellite distributors—Sky in Europe and Star in India—and Fox’s one-third stake in Hulu, which would give Disney controlling interest in the streaming company. Notably left out of any potential deal are Fox News, Fox Sports 1, and the Fox broadcast network.A Fox deal could present a multitude of legal hurdles. But some of the initial regulatory concerns that many cited as possibly holding up any Fox purchase seem much less relevant after a federal judge approved the AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  merger.Why It MattersDisney has become less dominant in recent years due to the rise of streaming services, such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime, as well as the proliferation of cord-cutting. But the company is in a better place than some might think based on some of the more surface level stories about the imminent demise of once-almighty ESPN (also read: Why You Should Buy Disney Stock Right Now).ESPN is still a live rights power, with NFL, college football, and the NBA all under its umbrella. Grabbing Fox’s hugely popular regional sports networks—which often get great ratings for NBA and MLB, especially compared to the rest of cable—would be a huge win for Disney in what will likely become some form of a standalone streaming version of ESPN, far superior to the currently available ESPN+ service. National and regional live sports programming will only become more valuable to advertisers in an age where hardly anything else needs to be watched live.Meanwhile, Disney would be able to utilize Fox’s TV and movie studios to bolster its cable, movie, and soon enough streaming offerings, when the company introduces its standalone Disney streaming service in late 2019. The company would absorb FX Networks, National Geographic, as well as key franchises such as Avatar, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four—which Disney would reunite with their superhero counterparts.Disney’s Marvel franchise has grossed more than $16 billion at the box office, in a pretty short amount of time. And the company, which initially thought of ending the Marvel Cinematic Universe soon, has no plans to stop now. Disney also owns Pixar and Lucasfilm’s Star War franchise, as well as its own studio that has jumped headfirst into live action remakes of many of its cartoon hits.Bottom LineThe idea here is simple: Disney wants to add to its content offerings as it races to adapt to the new age of subscription-based streaming and fight off Netflix.Disney’s streaming service is likely to include its library of movie and TV content, along with Fox’s, and a slew of new original programming made exclusively for the platform. “We're producing right now content for it, original content that is Pixar branded, Marvel branded, Star Wars branded, and Disney branded,” CEO Bob Iger said on a recent Disney earnings call.There is talk that Netflix’s offerings will be superior to a stand-alone Disney platform. But investors should ask themselves a simple question: why?  Five years ago Netflix didn’t even offer original content, they simply spent billions to roll out movies and shows in anticipation of Disney and other media houses pulling their content.  Disney could also easily adapt to Netflix’s model of offering a wide range of small-budget indie movies and shows along with its blockbusters and family-friendly Disney and Pixar movies, which are also released in theaters—something that isn’t likely to lose its appeal altogether. Disney simply has more money, more resources, and more big-name brands than Netflix.The company also has live content offerings through ESPN and ABC, something Netflix doesn't. So just imagine how attractive a streaming platform would be that offered live regional sports, national ESPN games, news, as well as new Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars shows, new original streaming content—outside of Disney’s usual wheelhouse—all its new Fox offerings, and its library of movies?Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1390,FOXA,"Wednesday, June 20, 2018Today’s big pre-market news involves a new bid from The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) to take over assets from 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), for $38 per share, or $71.3 billion. Reports are the offer would split the payout 50/50 between cash and stock. This outbids Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) offer last week to pay $35 per share for Fox assets, all cash.This deal has been in the making for more than half a year now, with the previous bid from Disney amounting to $28 per share. Seems a pittance now, especially considering that Comcast may come back with an even better offer, perhaps even bringing a new deal into the $40 per share range or higher. “Content is king,” of course, and in the timeless words of Mel Brooks, “It’s good to be the king.”FOXA shares jumped 6% almost immediately on the news, and after selling off a tad subsequently, has now ratcheted up nearly 8% currently. Year over year, Fox is up roughly 73% — and if a bidding war is indeed in the offing, we’re not done with these increases yet. Disney stock is also up at this hour, about 2.25%, and even Comcast is up by 4 cents right now.Disney and Fox have a longer relationship in place regarding content development, but no one seems to think this deal is over. Even representatives at Disney — and even after hearing news that Disney CEO Bob Iger and Fox CEP Rupert Murdoch dined together last night, according to CNBC’s David Faber — don’t believe Comcast is finished pursuing these assets. Stay tuned!Elsewhere, reports that Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is cutting sales forecasts has sent shares falling more than 3.5% in today’s pre-market. The retail coffee giant is also planning to shutter 150 stores in the next year, in what appears to be a plan to increase comps in existing stores. Starbucks stock is down 7% year over year, and has only met earnings estimates in three of its last four quarters.Also, Starbucks is one of the companies most often cited as potential collateral in a trade war between the U.S. and China. As China cannot match us tariff for tariff because they import less than 4x the goods from the U.S. than we import from their country, companies that do significant business in China — Yum China (YUMC  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), for instance — may face boycotts or other, shall we say, “anti-growth” measures.Some potentially good news on global trade? Germany has proposed lifting its 10% EU tariff on autos imported to the U.S. Defenders of President Trump's trade philosophy may point to this and say his method is working. But is Germany expecting anything in return, other than planning to flood the American market with Volkwagens, Audis and Mercedeses?Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1391,FOXA,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) popped over 3% through afternoon trading on Tuesday to hit yet another new all-time high on the back of the most bullish analysts call to date. GBH Insights upped its price target to a whopping $500 per share, less than a week after Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) lifted its target to $490. Therefore, investors clearly need to take a look at why analysts are so excited about the streaming giant.GBH Insights raised its NFLX price target from $400 per share to $500 on Tuesday, which marked a 28% premium from Monday’s closing price of $390.40. GBH’s updated price target marked the highest out of the 36 analysts who cover Netflix, according to FactSet. Meanwhile, the firm reaffirmed it “highly attractive” rating.""Our bullish thesis on Netflix is based on our belief that the company's competitive moat, franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and original content build out will translate into robust profitability and growth,"" analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients.More Fundamentals Netflix added 7.41 million new members in the first quarter, which marked a 50% jump from the year-ago period and topped the company’s forecast of 6.35 million. The streaming company closed the quarter with 125 million members. Looking forward to the second quarter, Netflix expects to add 6.2 million new members. These user figures and growth estimates are part of the reason analysts are so excited about Netflix. Last Week, Goldman analysts reiterated the firm’s buy rating for NFLX and upped their price target from $390 per share to $490 per share—the previous Wall Street high—citing the company’s growing content offerings and distribution ecosystem. GBH analysts pointed out similar reasons for their new price target.Investors will also be pleased to note that a GBH survey claimed that the average Netflix customer watches its service more than 10 hours per week, which tops Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Hulu’s five hours. GBH also stated that almost 90% of Netflix's subscribers said they would be willing to pay more for the service. This is a good sign for investors since people clearly think that Netflix’s content offerings are already worth the $13.99 a month price tag that it charges for its premium subscription.Netflix wisely began spending billions of dollars on its own original content when it realized how popular the streaming, commercial-free subscription model had become. The company understood that one day the Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) and Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) of the world would pull their movies and shows, or simply ask for too much. The company’s investments will become even more crucial after AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85 billion merger with Time Warner  was approved. Stock Price Movement Shares of NFLX have skyrocketed 1,108% over the last five years, before today’s climb. Netflix’s movement crushes Amazon’s 520% climb and Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) roughly 707% surge.NFLX has also soared over the last year, up nearly 164% against the S&P 500’s 14% climb. Investors will also see that shares of Netflix have climbed nearly 109% since the start of the year, which places it near the top of the S&P 500.Growth Outlook Lastly, investors will want to see some of the top and bottom line growth estimates that help support the recent string of bullish calls.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Netflix’s Q2 revenues to surge by 41.26% to reach $3.93 billion. The company’s full-year revenues are expected to climb by nearly 38% to touch $16.12 billion.At the other end of the income statement, Netflix’s adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket from $0.15 per share in the prior-year period to $0.80 per share. For the full-year, the company’s earnings are expected to climb by 130% to touch $2.88 per share.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1392,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. With the 2018 FIFA World Cup underway, Ben Rains dives into why it is so important that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America. Rains then discusses all of the latest happenings in the sports betting world, as more companies get in on the action.The U.S. didn’t make the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which will likely impact Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) coverage this summer. However, the company also holds the rights to the 2022 and 2026 World Cups, along with Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The 2026 bid was a little shady and upset the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and others—helping FIFA live up to its somewhat poor reputation.But with the United States set to host 60 games in 2026—many of which are likely to be in primetime—in what will be the first 48-team World Cup, Fox and Telemundo look to be the clear winners. More matches, more teams, and primetime games will likely attract many more companies on top of the major players Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY, and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Moving onto sports betting, a small soccer related partnership between William Hill WIMHY and Las Vegas Lights FC, of the United Soccer League USL, will see the betting company become the soccer team’s official sports book. The deal will allow fans to make live in-game bets through William Hill’s mobile app—partnerships like this are sure to become more commonplace as legalized sports betting becomes more popular.Sports gambling is now up and running in Delaware and New Jersey. Daily fantasy giant DraftKings has already applied for a sports betting license in New Jersey, which could kick off a wave of established companies, including Wynn (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), rolling out sports betting locations and platforms throughout the country.Meanwhile, investors should pay attention to tech companies, like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), to see if they utilize their infrastructure to get in on the massive mobile sports betting scene. It will also be worth keeping an eye out for any sports betting acquisitions, as startups are sure to pop up. As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1393,FOXA,"Ahead of the opening bell this Tuesday, we see a surprisingly high number of companies reporting Q1 (calendar) earnings both this morning and after the close this afternoon. True, most of the big names of the quarter have already brought forth their results, but companies like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and especially Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) report after the bell today.Speaking of Disney, what had looked like a done deal regarding its annexing of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) film, TV and international assets is currently up for debate, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reportedly gears up to sweeten the pot with its own offer for the creative businesses. The original Disney-Fox deal was for $52 billion; Comcast is looking to secure as much as $60 billion — all cash — to swoop in for those assets itself.Comcast was already in the mix somewhat, beforehand: it had put in a bid to buy British communications company Sky Broadcasting, or at least the 2/3 of the company Fox doesn’t already currently own. But one important component to all this is whether the proposed AT&T (T  -  Free Report)-Time Warner  merger passes regulatory appeal; while it does not appear to subvert any merger precedents, plenty of resistance for this deal — not least of all from the White House — have clouded this path for months.Time, as they say, will tell. The morning prior to Disney’s fiscal Q2 earnings report, the Zacks consensus expects $1.68 per share on $14.23 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 12% on the bottom line and 6.7% on the top. Disney has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of the last 4 quarters for a modest trailing 4-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.7%. For more on DIS’s earnings, click here.Before Tuesday’s open, Dean Foods (DF  -  Free Report) put up beats on both top and bottom lines for its Q1 earnings report, posting 14 cents per share that beat consensus by 2 cents (a penny higher year over year) on sales of $1.98 billion that outpaced the $1.84 billion analysts were expecting. This is only the second earnings beat for Dean in the past 4 quarters; ahead of its report, the company carried a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but had a Zacks Style Score (Value-Growth-Momentum) of A. For more on DF’s earnings, click here.

Powered by strong WiFi network, cable TV operators are gradually entering the wireless field through MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreements with incumbent carriers. Meanwhile, major telecom operators are entering the pay-TV industry, especially through online TV streaming services.At the same time, cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011. AT&T Inc.

1395,FOXA,"Shares of Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) climbed 1.3% on Monday as investors began to gear up for the release of the media and entertainment powerhouse’s second quarter financial results. Disney has failed to inspire a ton of investor confidence recently, but a strong quarter could help the company get back on track.Disney stock had sunk 9% over the last year and nearly 1% during the last four weeks prior to yesterday’s gains. Much of Disney’s recent downturn has been blamed on ESPN’s continued struggles. With that said, its Studio Entertainment division revenue actually slumped 1% in the first quarter. Luckily for investors, Disney’s Parks and Resorts unit surge 13% to help lift the company’s overall revenues.Still, at this point, investors need to know what to expect from Disney’s Q2 earnings as they might be the only thing that can propel the stock in the near-term, while many wait to see what comes of the proposed Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) deal.Disney Q2 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Disney’s quarterly revenues to jump by 6.7% from the year-ago period to reach $14.23 billion. Investors should also be pleased to note that the company’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 12% to reach $1.68 per share.Furthermore, Disney has earned three upward earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days. But investors will need to know a little bit more in order to understand if Disney is expected to beat or miss our current earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Disney’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.69 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.94%.Therefore, investors should consider Disney a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports after the closing bell today.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1396,FOXA,"Shares of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) jumped more than 9% after the company reported robust first-quarter earnings on Apr 16. The video streaming giant crushed its own expectations for new subscriber additions in the quarter, once again proving that it is going from strength to strength. Netflix has been on a dream run for quite some time now, with subscriber gains clearly helping it to earn more revenues. Year to date, Netflix is already up 66.7%. So does Netflix have further room for improvement in the days to come? Netflix’s strength lies in the original content it produces, which has seen its subscriber base grow over the years. Moreover, Netflix is no long just a tech giant. It is giving stiff competition to studios like The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), Time Warner Inc.  and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report).Record Subscriber AdditionsAn expanding customer base coupled with higher prices for its streaming service gave a boost to Netflix’s revenues. The Los-Gatos, CA-based company added 7.4 million customers in the first quarter, surpassing not only analysts’ expectations by around 1.7 million but also its own expectations of 6.35 million. Of these, international subscriber addition accounted for 5.46 million, while U.S. additions totaled 1.96 million.Interestingly, subscriber additions jumped ignoring the company’s pushed up subscription price to $10.99 in the United States at 2017 end. This certainly did help the company in registering stunning profits. The streaming giant posted $290.1 million in net income, higher than profits generated by it in the entire year of 2016 (read more: Netflix Q1 Earnings Gain From Solid Overseas Growth).Understandably, people are least perturbed about the hike in subscription and Netflix seems to be riding high on its strong customer loyalty. Since reporting its first-quarter results, shares of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Netflix have surged around 5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Original Content Biggest StrengthShares of Netflix have surged more than 66% year to date, way ahead of other tech giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), which have gained only 35%, 8.6% and 11%, respectively.Price Performance of Netflix Vs. Peers Netflix definitely is changing the entire streaming ballgame by virtue of its high original content quotient. The company entered into the movie business and even earned an Oscar but now, it has a separate plan. Instead of getting directly into competition with the theatres, Netflix now looks keener on streaming movies in the form of web series.Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings last week said, “What we’ll do now is mostly focus on series, and standup, docuseries, and great content we can do without disrupting or being perceived to disrupt the movie sector.” Incidentally, the company plans to pump $8 billion in original programming.Moreover, spending on licensed content is also on the rise, with the company expecting to shell out $17.9 billion this year, up from $15.3 billion in 2017. Understandably, demand for original content is expected to further help Netflix increase its subscriber base, which is definitely going to translate into higher profits.Does Netflix Have Sufficient Upside?Netflix has gained a whopping 66.7% year to date. However, the only factor that is going against the stock at this point is valuation. Netflix has a PEG ratio of 3.42 that makes it pricier than the S&P 500, which has a PEG ratio of 1.72.However, Netflix’s median PEG ratio over a five-year span is 4.93. Additionally, it touched a peak PEG value of 23.60 during the fourth quarter of 2015, which means that it remains pricey but has further room to run.Moreover, the ongoing market rally has dispelled concerns over valuation time and time again. Tech majors have delivered robust earnings performances for quite some time now, as was yet again confirmed by Netflix’s first-quarter results, which justifies its high valuation. Most importantly, for a company like Netflix that depends largely if not solely on customer loyalty, a stupendous subscriber addition speaks volumes about its sustainable profitability.Netflix’s whopping 7.4 million subscriber addition in the first quarter coupled with its increased focus on original content gives it room for further upside in 2018.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1397,FOXA,"Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 9.The company has agreed to sell Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight, Fox 2000, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India, and 21st Century Fox’s interests in National Geographic Partners, Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group to The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report).Moreover, Twenty-First Century Fox plans to spin-off Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network (BTN) into a new “Fox”. The new company will also include Twenty-First Century Fox’s studio lot in Los Angeles and equity investment in Roku.Moreover, the company is also bidding for the remaining shares of Sky Plc, which it anticipates to wrap up by Jun 30, 2018.However, bidding war between the company and Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is expected to intensify as the cable giant recently submitted a $31-billion offer for Sky.Earnings History & Q3 TrendTwenty-First Century Fox has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.28%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings of 42 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. However, the figure declined 20.8% on a year-over-year basis. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Quote Meanwhile, net sales have outpaced the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, net sales increased 5% year over year to $8.04 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.97 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has remained steady at 52 per share over the last seven days, reflecting year-over-year decline of 3.7%.

Moreover, the consensus mark for Television segment is currently pegged at almost $1.30 billion, down 23.4% year over year.Moreover, significant increase in global sports programming cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. Television profitability is also expected to hurt from an increasing contractual sports programming costs at the FOX Broadcast Network.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.We believe that Twenty-First Century Fox is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the first quarter due to an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

1398,FOXA,"Alcohol companies are focusing on spending millions of dollars to convince people that alcohol consumption could be a healthy habit, according to published investigations by Stat, The New York Times and Wired. In fact, per a 2015 Gallup poll, one out of five Americans consider that “moderate” alcohol consumption is actually a healthy practice. This belief clearly benefits the alcohol industry because moderation for drinkers varies significantly when it comes to alcohol.In this context, earnings of alcohol companies scheduled for release over the next week, assume greater significance. With both brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) scheduled to report earnings on May 9, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both AB InBev and Ambev S.A. carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled on the same day include Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG  -  Free Report) and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceThe AB InBev stock has declined 19.9% in the last one year, while the Zacks categorized Alcoholic Beverages industry has gained 1.1%. However, Ambev has increased 7.1%, significantly better than competitor AB InBev and the industry.ValuationThe price-to-sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer-focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates the market value of each of the company’s sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared to the wider industry, which has an exorbitant P/S ratio of 19.24. However, Ambev is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 5.59, higher than AB InBev’s reading of 2.74.Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within an industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 14.11%, AB InBev is lower than the industry average of 21.6%. Meanwhile, Ambev, with net margin of 24.77%, is better placed on this count compared to its rival and industry.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of the beer industry, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability.Both AB InBev and Ambev have better leverage positions than the industry, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 61.22%. Coming back to the individual companies, debt-to-equity ratio of AB InBev and Ambev is 1.45% and 10.36%, respectively. Clearly, with a low debt-to-equity ratio this round goes to AB InBev.Asset Turnover RatioSince the alcohol industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes, activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company. All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company’s ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash. The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales.With an asset turnover ratio of 0.57, Ambev is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.53. In this context, AB InBev has an asset turnover ratio of 0.45, which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Ambev.Quick Ratio Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity, the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is. In other words, it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities. The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets that are relatively less liquid such as inventory.With a quick ratio of 0.66, Ambev is better placed than the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.63. AB InBev is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0.54.Earnings History and ESPWhile considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks for the current quarter as both the alcohol giants having readings of 0. However, taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history, Ambev has delivered a negative surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average negative earnings surprise of 5%. Meanwhile, AB In Bev is at disadvantage, as it has not only delivered negative earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters, but also has an average negative earnings surprise of 12.3%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that AB InBev holds an edge over Ambev when considering valuation ratio and leverage position. But on all other counts Ambev has a clear edge. Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and good earnings history, it is better placed when considering net margin, debt-to-equity, asset turnover and quick ratios. In this context, Ambev clearly holds an edge over AB InBev ahead of earnings.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"
1400,FOXA,"Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) has for years struggled to grow its user base, but the social media company’s push into live video could turn into a game-changing move. With that said, let’s dive into the details of Twitter’s streaming video future as it continues to secure big-time partnerships and more advertising dollars.Twitter reported GAAP profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter. This positive trend continued in the first quarter, with Twitter posting GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s Q1 revenues surged 21% to reach $665 million, which topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $609.3 million by a healthy margin.The social media company expanded its daily active user based by 10% year-over-year, while its monthly active user base reached 336 million. This marked only a 3% year-over-year gain, but 10 million new MAUs helped the company boost its ever-growing advertising revenue.AdvertisingTwitter's advertising revenues climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Investors will notice that Twitter’s ad revenue surge matched its overall revenue climb. The simple reason is that like fellow social media firms, including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), Twitter makes a large chunk of its money from advertising—roughly 86% in Q1.The social media company’s international ad revenue climbed by 52%, bolstered by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, highlighted by strong video performance in Japan. This advertising growth is what should give people hope that Twitter might finally be ready to turn into the money-maker many hoped it would be years ago.Twitter’s quarterly ad engagements also surged 69% in Q1, while its cost per engagement dropped 28% from the year-ago quarter. Video accounted for more than half of Twitter’s advertising revenues and was also the company’s fastest growing ad segment.Live VideoTwitter’s march toward live video success has been slow, but it seems that the company might have finally hit an inflection point. The company streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1. Investors should also note that roughly 80% of these live-streams reached a global audience.Looking ahead, the social media company announced that it signed more than 30 new video deals last quarter. This includes live-streaming rights, highlights, as well as VOD partnerships.On its surface, 30 new video contracts might sound insignificant. But Twitter has really positioned itself well as the world shifts more and more toward streaming. The company locked down a new deal with Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report) for multiple FIFA World Cup-related shows—which is by far the most popular sporting event in the world.Twitter also inked new deals with MLB and MLS, along with NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and others. Twitter now has a live video foothold in everything from video gaming and sports to news and entertainment.Looking AheadTwitter’s live video push and its bottom line growth have also made its stock look far more reasonably priced. Twitter is now trading at 41.7x earnings, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average P/E of 58.3. Furthermore, despite its strong first quarter, Twitter stock currently sits roughly 20% below its 52-week high, which means now might be a great time to buy.Twitter’s full-year revenues are also expected to climb roughly 19% to hit $2.89 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 66% to reach $0.73 per share.Bottom LineThe social media company became famous and hugely important for its breaking news and instant dissemination capabilities. Now, Twitter can couple its interactivity and breaking news features with both stand-alone and complimentary live video.Twitter is still nowhere near where Facebook and other tech companies are in terms of live video reach. But it is not hard to envision Twitter becoming a much more legitimate live streaming video player as it continues to secure deals with major content creators.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1401,FOXA,"Since AT&T (T  -  Free Report) bought Time Warner  for $85 million, media companies all over the nation have spiraled into a manic frenzy over who will acquire what company next. It seems as though a new company is looking to merge every month, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) are in a head to head battle over 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) top assets, as well as Viacom  and CBS (CBS  -  Free Report).The CEOs of these legacy companies won’t say anything about the future of their companies to the public, but secretly, they know that the days of pay TV is slowly dying.These media giants have one victim to blame, and that is none other than Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). According to CNBC, executives at these media companies believe that even if they are not directly responsible, Netflix is at least holding the murder weapon. These companies also believe that it is unfair to them that the more Netflix spends on its content, the more shares go up.It makes sense that media companies seem intimidated or frightened by Netflix, seeing as online streaming and using the internet as a means to watch your shows/movies has become quite popular in the past couple of years. According to research done by Pew Center, 61% of young adults between the ages of 18-29 use online streaming services such as Netflix and HBO Go as their primary source of watching television.One of the main reasons why Netflix soars above these traditional media companies is mostly due to the fact that the number of their global subscribers continues to increase, whereas most of these media companies don’t have a global viewership. According to Bloomberg, in 2017, Netflix notched 5.2 million subscribers, with 4.14 million of those being global subscribers. Even though it is an American company, Netflix has dominated many international markets. Not only does that benefit the company, but it gives them an edge over others, seeing as they are known worldwide.In today’s society, companies try to beat out one another whether it’s with their advertising strategies, share prices or culture. Netflix uses all three of those tactics to knock out its competition and continue to take up its space in the market.While Netflix sits back and watches the show, these other media conglomerates frantically continue to find ways to compete with and outperform Netflix, as well as develop strategies that could possibly revive their viewership and eventually begin streaming online.   Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

1402,FOXA,"This week was an eventful one with some key developments dominating the headlines and influencing ETFs. Below we discuss some of these events.Trump and Kim Reach DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending a 68-year long bitterness. The leaders signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street. Peace talks pushed down defense ETFs after the summit. iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) and Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF PPA all shed at least 1% since the Trump-Kim deal. All these ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AT&T-Time Warner Deal Gets Green SignalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. This led to a surge in media ETFs - Invesco Dynamic Media ETF (PBS  -  Free Report) and iShares Evolved U.S. Media and Entertainment ETF IEME. PBS has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).Fed Turns HawkishAs expected, the Fed raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels since August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But, this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly leading to a decline in net margins. As a result, the ultra-popular bank ETF - SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) is down nearly 1% post Fed meeting. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (read: Fed Turns Hawkish: ETF Areas to Win). ECB to Exit QE, Maintained Dovish View The European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European shares, which is poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, currency hedged ETFs, which seek to tap the bullish international fundamentals by dodging the effects of a decline in weak euro, seem an attractive option. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ  -  Free Report) is a popular fund tracking European equities while at the same time protecting against wakening euro. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (read: Currency Hedged ETF Hits New 52-Week High).World Cup Fever Leads to Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has started in Russia with expectations of solid growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Pro Sports Sponsors ETF FANZ, Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (BJK  -  Free Report) could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event. SOCL and BJK have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (read: 6 ETFs to Score High from World Cup Spending Spree).Trump Prepares for Chinese TariffTrump has approved the plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move, if enacted, could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (PBJ  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF FTXG are on investors’ radar and could take a hit from US-China trade disputes. PBJ has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 while FTXG has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

(DIS  -  Free Report) regarding the acquisition of majority assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report).Speculation on many more merger deals in near future in the integrated telecom-cable TV-media space has significantly raised stock prices of most of the major stocks of media, telecom and cable TV industries. The tech-based Nasdaq Composite was the largest beneficiary of this market trend which helped the index to achieve new all-time high level.ECB to Follow Low-Interest PolicyOn Jun 14, the ECB, announced after its governing council meeting that the central bank will continue its low interest rate policy and benchmark rates will remain unchanged until mid-2019.

1404,FOXA,"Shares of Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report) soared over 7% on Tuesday one day after Oppenheimer analysts upgraded the streaming TV firm. So now let’s take a look to see if Roku stock might be worth buying with the streaming content revolution set to continue. Upgrade Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein upgraded Roku to “outperform” on Monday. The company sells an array of devices that allow customers to watch their favorite streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime all in one place, similar to Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) TV, Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chromecast or an Amazon Fire Stick. Yet, Oppenheimer cited the company’s Roku Channel and its new targeted advertising push as reasons to be more optimistic about Roku’s future.  The Roku Channel allows users to watch hundreds of streaming movies and TV shows for free without a subscription, which Helfstein sees as a great way for the company to bolster its user base—Roku had roughly 21 million customers at the end of the first quarter, up 47% from the year-ago period. The relatively new offering makes Roku devices more enticing because it then becomes a standalone streaming service akin to Hulu and Netflix, on top of the ability to access users’ other streaming accounts. “The rapid adoption of The Roku Channel gives us incremental confidence in the channel's ability to garner viewership on other platforms, such as Samsung, allowing Roku to monetize a broader portion of the OTT ecosystem than we had previously assumed was possible,” Helfstein wrote.Helfstein also set a new $50 price target for Roku, which marked 15% upside from Monday’s closing price. Roku, which went public last September at $14 per share, is also set to make much more money from its video advertising.This upgrade comes just a week after Roku launched a new “Audience Marketplace” that will allow advertisers to buy ad space targeted directly to specific audiences, “by leveraging Roku’s first-party data and proprietary ad technology,” according to a company release.21st Century Fox, (FOXA  -  Free Report), Turner, Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and others have all signed on to sell TV ad inventory in the new marketplace. These ads will appear during programming that users watch on Roku devices that would already show advertisements.  “Over-the-top distribution has been a key audience driver for Turner’s portfolio of premium content, with Roku being one of the preeminent partner platforms,” VP of Ad Innovation & Programmatic Solutions at Turner, Larry Allen, said in a statement. “Participating in Roku’s Audience Marketplace gives us access to rich insights and enhanced audience targeting capabilities, extending the ability for ad buyers to reach and engage with streaming viewing audiences that are critical to grow their business.”Fundamentals Now that we have covered the upgrade and what Roku does, let’s dive into some of the company’s other fundamentals to help investors see if the stock might be worth buying at the moment.Last quarter, the company posted an adjusted loss of $0.07 per share, which actually came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for a loss of $0.16 per share. Meanwhile, Roku’s revenues climbed 36% to $136.58 million. The company's average revenue per user also soared 50% to $15.07.Looking ahead, Roku noted that it expects to operate at or near break-even on an adjusted EBITDA basis. The company also boasted that one in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. during Q1 were Roku TVs—televisions with built-in Roku—up from one in five in 2017.For the full-year, Roku is projected to see its revenues climb by 35.5% to $694.99 million, based on our current estimates. At the other end of the income statement, Roku is once again expected to post an adjusted loss, which is hardly uncommon for a young tech company. With that said, Roku is projected to swing from an expected loss of $0.30 per share in fiscal 2018 to adjusted earnings of $0.04 per share in fiscal 2019.Bottom LineRoku is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that has earned five full-year upward earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades for 2018 and 2019, all within the last 60 days. The company is also expected to grow its user base through its free streaming content offerings, and bolster its advertising revenues through its new marketplace.Meanwhile, the TV industry is slowly shifting toward an OTT model, which means companies like Roku will start to get more customers based on larger market trends alone.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

This is the longest losing streak since Mar 2017. Concerns surrounding a prospective trade war continued to dampen investor sentiment.

1407,FOXA,"The NFL Draft begins Thursday night, kicking off a three-day event that has transformed from a humble ballroom production into a big budget spectacle and the NFL’s most important offseason offering. But instead of more speculation about the top picks, let’s tackle the big business that fuels the 2018 NFL Draft.New York City played host to the NFL Draft for the first 50 years, moving from hotels to its long-time home, Radio City Music Hall. Then, in 2015, the NFL moved on from the 6,000 seat theater to Chicago, where it was held for two years.Last year, Philadelphia won the rights to host the event, building upon Chicago’s impressive outdoor fan festivities. Roughly 250,000 visitors spent an estimated $56 million on everything from hotels to food in Philadelphia.‘Everything's Bigger In Texas’ This year, the Dallas Cowboys play host to the 2018 NFL Draft at AT&T (T  -  Free Report) Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where roughly 400,000 people have registered to attend. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Event Trust Funds even donated $2.2 million to help Jerry Jones’ team play host.Outside of the 20,000 fans a day that will gain entry into AT&T Stadium to watch the actual draft, 27 NFL corporate sponsors will host and market to fans during the three-day NFL circus. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) and Frito-Lay (PEP  -  Free Report) are set to host fans at different pop-up venues. Meanwhile, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) will run a clinic with Dallas Cowboys’ star Ezekiel Elliott.Fresh off grabbing official NFL sponsorship rights from Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut will try to capitalize on the fanfare. Another big NFL partner, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), is the presenting sponsor of the red carpet, as well as the NFL Network’s TV coverage.Television Extravaganza Last year’s NFL Draft grabbed an average of 4.6 million combined TV viewers across ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and NFL Network. And this year could be even bigger, as it marks the first time that the entire NFL Draft will be broadcast live on television.The first three rounds of the draft, on Thursday and Friday, will be broadcast live across the NFL Network, Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN Deportes. Saturday’s coverage will also be available on NFL Network and ESPN, with ABC simulcasting ESPN’s coverage of rounds four through seven for the first time ever.Draft coverage can also be live streamed through the NFL app or NFL.com, as well as on the Fox Sports and ESPN apps. Notably left out of the coverage are CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), which both pay billions to broadcast NFL games.Player Money Clearly, the NFL Draft is a big business. But the people that stand to benefit the most during the three-day event are the players taken in the first-round, particularly those drafted in the top 10.Myles Garrett, last year’s top pick, signed a fully guaranteed four-year, $30.4 million contract with the Cleveland Browns. This included a $20.3 million signing bonus. The last pick in the first-round, Ryan Ramczyk, signed a four-year, $8.9 million contract with $6.7 million guaranteed.The average second-round contract was worth about $5 million over four years, according to Spotrac.com. These numbers slowly shrink as the rounds go on, with pick 256 in the 2018 draft excepted to land a signing bonus of $69,784.Meanwhile, the top pick in the 2018 NFL Draft is expected to make $32.9 million over his first four years, including a $22.1 million signing bonus.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1408,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the host taking on Saudi Arabia in the inaugural match. There seems to be nothing much to look forward to for the United States in this world cup. But the world’s biggest economy along with neighbors Canada and Mexico has clinched the opportunity to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, beating Morocco.This is definitely good news for North America at a time when political tension is looming between the United States and its once allies, Canada and Mexico. Winning the world cup bid is expected to boost the United States’ and Canada’s joint football event, Major League Soccer (MLS). Moreover, companies like NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox also have ample reasons to rejoice this bid clinched by the three countries.Hosting 2026 World Cup is Good News for MLSThe 2026 FIFA World Cup will be bigger than the ongoing tournament in Russia. This year’s World Cup has 32 teams competing for the coveted title, while in 2026 the number of teams will be 48. Moreover, instead of 64 matches this time around, 80 matches will be played. The United States will host 60 matches, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 matches each.With the United States becoming one of the co-hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, ESPN’s Darren Rovell said that the “profile of U.S. soccer” will get a boost. Additionally, MLS franchises and sponsors are also expected to gain from this latest development. In fact, only last year, Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) has signed a $700-million deal with MLS to retain the league’s official sponsorship at least till 2024.Telemundo, Fox Clear Winners of 2026 World CupWith the United States, Canada and Mexico chosen as the host of 2026 FIFA World Cup, broadcasters like Comcast Corporation-owned (CMCSA  -  Free Report) NBCUniversal’s Telemundo and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) are likely to gain. Way back in 2011, Telemundo and Fox together paid $1.1 billion to corner the U.S. rights to broadcast the 2018 Russia World Cup and the Qatar 2022 World Cup.However, FIFA feared that Qatar’s high temperatures may have a negative impact on the entire competition, following which FIFA decided to stage the mega football event in the fall of 2022. This did not go down well with Telemundo and Fox as other big sporting events, like National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and National Football League take place during that time.In order to make up for this situation, FIFA decided to give the broadcasting rights for 2026 World Cup in the United States to Telemundo and Fox in a private auction. This in turn is definitely a positive for these two television networks.What Does This 3-Nation Event Mean for FIFA?The United States together with Canada and Mexico won the joint bid to host the 2026 World Cup in a 134 to 65 vote. North America is projected to generate revenues of $14 billion, while FIFA’s profits are estimated to be around $11 billion. The amount is more than half of what Morocco, another contender for the 2026 event, could offer the football regulatory body.This is definitely a big opportunity for sports footwear and apparel company, NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report). Moreover, smaller competitors like Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) can also gain from the event by sponsoring participating countries.Given this scenario, other companies like YouTube-owner Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and social networking giant Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), are also expected to gain. Both Alphabet and Facebook have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ConclusionFor the first time, three countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico, will be hosting a FIFA World Cup. The 2026 event is certainly big news for broadcasters, sports apparel and footwear designers, streaming networks, and social media behemoths.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1409,FOXA,"Shares of Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) climbed over 2.6% in early morning trading Thursday, the day after Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) outbid the historic entertainment company for key 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets. This could lead to a bidding war, and Disney might end up missing out. Still, Disney stock seems worth considering at the moment because its fundamentals are pretty strong.  Fox  Deal Overview Comcast offered to buy a massive chunk of Fox’s entertainment and international assets for $65 billion, which the company said marked a 19% premium compared to Disney’s all-stock offer worth $52.4 billion. Disney and Comcast both plan to buy Fox's movie and TV production assets, cable networks such as FX, popular entertainment properties, two major satellite distributors—Sky in Europe and Star in India—as well as Fox’s stake in Hulu—which would give Disney a controlling stake in the streaming company.Fox is set to vote on Disney’s offer on July 10, which means there could certainly be a lot of back-and-forth in the coming weeks. And the regulatory concerns that many cited as possibly holding up any Fox purchase seem much less relevant after a federal judge approved the AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  merger on Tuesday.Recent Performance Now that we have quickly gone over the Fox assets Disney plans to acquire, let’s dive into some of the company’s other fundamentals. Disney topped both top and bottom estimates in its fiscal second quarter, with its overall revenue up 9% from the year-ago period to $14.55 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS figure climbed roughly 23%.Shares of Disney have climbed 240% over the last 10 years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 129% climb. This upward movement also tops Comcast’s 238% surge as well as Fox’s 172%. Disney stock has lagged just behind the index’s roughly 73% surge over the last five years, up nearly 68%.Investors will see DIS has done very little over the last three years, with shares down nearly 2%. Looking a little closer, Disney stock has been on a rollercoaster ride during this stretch, but is, in fact, up nearly 11% over the last two years. The recent up and down movement seems to stem, in part, from overreactions to ESPN’s woes, which have been somewhat overblown compared to linear TV’s overall decline.Valuation Moving on, Disney’s valuation picture should please investors. Coming into Thursday, Disney stock was trading at 14.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, DIS has traded as high as 17.8X and as low as 13.4X, with a one-year median of 15.5X.Expanding our view a little further, investors will see that Disney’s valuation appears very attractive at its current level, if not cheap, as it rests just above its three-year low and marks a major discount to the S&P 500’s 17.3X. DIS also rests well below its industry’s average of 20.2X.Growth Outlook With all that said, investors must also understand Disney’s growth outlook. The company’s quarterly earnings are expected to surge by over 25% to reach $1.98 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Disney’s full-year earnings are projected touch $7.08 per share, which would mark over a 24% expansion.The company is also expected to see its quarterly revenues climb by 10.2% to hit $15.69 billion, while its full-year revenues are projected to pop by 8% to reach $59.56 billion. Both its quaterly and full-year growth would be rather impressive for a company of its size and age.Bottom Line Disney would love to grab the Fox assets as it tries to build up its war chest at a time when owning content is paramount. But, investors shouldn’t worry too much if Disney is beat out because the company’s portfolio already includes Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and more.These assets should help it compete against the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) when it launches its new standalone streaming service in late 2019. Coupled with ABC, ESPN, and its other cable networks, Disney will do just fine in the new entertainment age.Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports “A” grades for Value and Momentum and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 1.6%.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1410,FOXA,"U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). It is the largest all-cash deal ever, surpassing Bayer's $64 billion merger with Monsanto, according to Thomson Reuters.The move was highly expected, especially after the regulatory approval for AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) acquisition of Time Warner . The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal (read: AT&T-TWX Deal Approval to Spark M&A Frenzy: 4 ETFs to Profit).This is because Comcast’s offer is 19% higher than that of House of The Mouse, which is home to Lucasfilm (the Star Wars movies), Marvel (Avengers) and Pixar (Toy Story) as well as the Disney brands. Fox shareholders are expected to vote on the Disney transaction on Jul 10 though the company can postpone it.How Fox Matters to BothBoth Disney and Comcast are hoping to acquire Fox’s film production business, which includes Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000, and popular entertainment properties - X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool. Fox TV film studio includes This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The acquisition of these assets will enhance the streaming and television content of both the companies and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).For Comcast, the purchase of Fox could bulk up its portfolio of films and TV shows and help in luring Internet and cable subscriptions, which have been lower in the wake of surging demand for online services. It also gives the company a majority stake in Hulu as CMCSA already owns a sizable chunk of it. The deal will add to what Comcast already has within NBCUniversal, include channels like Bravo and E!, as well as Universal Pictures film library. Comcast could become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox.As far as Disney is concerned, the acquisition will complement its planned launch of an ESPN streaming service in 2018 and the studio's streaming service in 2019 (read: Disney-Fox Deal to Change Media Industry: ETF in Focus).Market ImpactThe battle to acquire Fox could transform the entire media industry, setting the stage for a surge in media ETFs. Below we have highlighted a couple of them:Invesco Dynamic Media ETF (PBS  -  Free Report)PBS provides exposure to media stocks under one roof. It seeks to offer capital appreciation by investing in companies that are selected on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value by tracking the Dynamic Media Intellidex Index. The product has AUM of $50.1 million and average daily volume of 15,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: 6 ETFs to Score High from World Cup Spending Spree).iShares Evolved U.S. Media and Entertainment ETF (IEME  -  Free Report)This newly actively managed ETF employs data science techniques to identify companies with exposure to the media and entertainment sector. It has accumulated $5.2 million in its asset base since Mar 21. The ETF charges 18 bps in annual fees and trades in paltry volume of around 2,000 shares.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Making the scenario more complex, Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), on Wednesday, made a $31-billion offer to take over Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report), which raises the specter for a potential bidding war between Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the cable television giant. Fox had earlier offered $16.5 billion to take over the remaining assets of Sky.Understandably, every broadcaster is trying to increase its international presence with acquisitions, to stay ahead in the race. In fact, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in Dec 2017 cut a $52.4-billion deal to acquire Fox’s television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets.It goes without saying that broadcasters are trying to make their international presence stronger given the stiff competition they are facing from streaming giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), which are fast invading their space and changing the entire ballgame. As the bidding war starts, it now needs to be seen, which players finally gets bigger share of the pie.Comcast Gears Up for Global PresenceComcast has graduated from a cable television giant to a diversified media company. Its recent $31-billion bid to take over Sky proves that the company now plans to expand and make its international presence felt. In fact, in late February, Comcast had expressed its desire to take over the assets of Sky, which Fox is eyeing as well. Interestingly, Fox holds a 39% stake in Sky and had made a $16.5-billion offer to buy the remaining stake in the company in 2016.Understandably, this will only result in a potential bidding war between the two companies. Sky is a lucrative property given its 23-million strong subscriber foothold in Europe. And taking over such a prized company will only add to Comcast’s broadcasting, comprising NBCUniversal, which has an eclectic mix of news, entertainment and sports content.Moreover, Sky, which holds the rights of British Premiere League in the U.K., extended the U.S. television rights to NBCSports through 2022 in February. Naturally, a deal with Sky will help Comcast get broader access to the international market. Sky plc has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Taking over Sky makes sense to Comcast at a time when its rivals are scaling up. Charter Communication, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is aggressively working on mobile expansion, while AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is also planning to buy out Time Warner Inc.  to enhance its pay TV and digital content. Given this scenario, taking over Sky will only strengthen Comcast’s broadcasting arm.Broadcasting ConundrumComcast’s formal bid to take over Sky has definitely made the entire broadcasting war more complex, as almost all the industry giants are trying to expand. Walt Disney in Dec 2017 entered into a deal to acquire Fox television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets. Understandably, this deal was a move to increase the company’s global presence in broadcasting. However, a few lucrative assets such as Fox News and Fox Broadcasting were left out.Fox, on the other hand, had placed an offer to buy out the remaining 61% stake in Sky. In fact, Sky’s independent directors had recommended that the company’s shareholders accept Fox’s offer. However, with Comcast making a bid, Sky’s directors have withdrawn their recommendation.Undoubtedly, Comcast has now put both Disney and Fox in a complicated situation, first and foremost because it automatically increases the stake for Disney’s bid for Fox. Moreover, if Fox doesn’t get into the bidding war, Disney might bid for Sky separately, as it had previously indicated. This is more so because Disney’s CEO Bob Iger had long expressed his desire to buy Sky calling it “the crown jewel.”On the other hand, for Fox, acquiring Sky is more an emotional decision, given that Rupert Murdoch had founded the satellite broadcaster in 1990 and already holds a 39% stake.The Real CompetitionThe biggest story amid all these bids and counter bids is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money and the only way to stay in the race is by expanding and diversifying their content.In fact, Netflix has already said that it will spend $8 billion in 2018 just only on content. Comcast’s recent decision to add Netflix to its bundled offering is further proves the growing demand and preference for online content. Although it too early to predict a winner, it makes sense for broadcasting giants to diversify their portfolio to survive the onslaught of streaming giants.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

1413,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into BodyArmor as the sports drink newcomer looks to take on Gatorade. Next, we discuss the NBA’s latest deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, before we close with a look at a deal that could impact Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service.BodyArmor—which has no relation to Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—is ready to take on PepsiCo’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s (KO  -  Free Report) Powerade in the multibillion-dollar sports drink market. Those unfamiliar with BodyArmor might soon see the company a lot more after it launched its latest national television campaign, which features some big stars, including James Harden.The company could also get a real boost from one of its largest investors, Kobe Bryant, who also happens to play a big role in BodyArmor’s creative vision. BodyArmor has a long way to go to try to catch up to Powerade and Gatorade, but the drink market is going through a massive shake-up recently. And with Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as another major investor, BodyArmor could be poised to become a legitimate long-term player in the sports drink market.Full-Court Finance then transitions into the NBA’s latest streaming rights deal with Twitch for its brand new esports league, which the NBA created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report). The NBA has been on the cutting edge of a lot of media trends, and its growing relationship with Amazon could end up playing a much bigger role as streaming TV providers, from Hulu to YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report), slowly look to enter the live sports business.We then close with a look at a possible partnership between ESPN and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The two companies reportedly proposed to split a UFC TV package last week that, if completed, would see some UFC fights move to Disney’s brand new ESPN+ streaming service (also read: Should Disney Investors Worry As ESPN Plus Underwhelms?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1414,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we break down Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service, which might fail to impress investors at a time when the sports broadcasting giant really needs a boost.Disney officially launched ESPN+ on Thursday, April 12 after nearly two years of anticipation. ESPN+ might not be exactly what investors hoped for, but it is Disney’s first real streaming offering as the company begins to compete against the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).ESPN, under the guidance of its new boss Jimmy Pitaro, launched the streaming service in conjunction with an updated ESPN App. The $4.99 a month ESPN+ streaming service—which is available on Amazon, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) devices—hopes to complement ESPN’s linear television offerings as the cord-cutting revolution leaves ESPN weakened.ESPN+ will offer users the chance to watch live streaming coverage of MLB, NHL, MLS, PGA Tour Golf, as well as an array of college sports. The service also hopes to entice fans of globally popular games such as rugby and cricket. Furthermore, users can binge ESPN original programming, including the 30 for 30 documentary series, along with new offerings such as a Kobe Bryant NBA show.However, many investors and sports fans will notice that ESPN+ does not currently offer users the chance to watch ESPN’s premier coverage. This means sports fans must still have a cable or streaming subscription of some kind that includes ESPN in order to watch Monday Night Football, NBA games, as well as big-time college football and basketball.  With that said, ESPN+ might not help Disney make much money just yet and will likely leave investors wanting more. But the silver lining is that ESPN+ gives the entertainment powerhouse the ability to work out any kinks before it launches its stand-alone Disney streaming service that aims to become a serious streaming player, even if Disney’s deal with Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) doesn’t go through.  Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

1415,FOXA,"The Masters’ tagline has been “a tradition unlike any other” for years. The validity of this claim aside, the first major championship of the year at Augusta National Golf Club is unique to the rest of major sports and golf as a whole for the simple fact that it does not pursue the most money possible.Augusta keeps many of its financial dealings under wraps, but the Masters reportedly generated revenues of roughly $115 million in 2015, according to a Golf Digest report. The club also leaves millions of dollars on the table when you consider the relatively cheap ticket prices, insanely inexpensive food, and absence of online merchandise.So where does the money come from and where does all of it go?AugustaThe most basic revenue breakdown is as follows: merchandise ($47.5 million); tickets ($34.75 million); international TV rights ($25 million); and concessions ($7.75 million).Augusta pours millions and millions of dollars into the course every year. Another large chunk of the money goes directly to the players. The Masters will shell out a total of $11million in prize money this year, which is the second-highest on tour.Masters tickets, one of the largest revenue generators despite their relatively low costs, are usually won and purchased through a lottery system. But tickets always end up on secondary markets. Four day badges for the Masters had been selling for about $6,500 right up until the start of Thursday’s first-round, on various ticket sites.One of the most obvious ways that Augusta leaves money on the greens is through its now iconically-cheap food and drink offerings.Once again, the amazing concession prices at the Masters. Important Note: Today’s badge alone is going to cost you about $1,750. pic.twitter.com/DGhfsy4gJN— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) April 5, 2018TelevisionCBS (CBS  -  Free Report) will broadcast weekend coverage of the Masters for the 63rd year in a row. The network and Augusta have worked on one-year deals pretty much the entire time, and look as if they will continue this relationship in perpetuity.Interestingly, neither CBS nor Augusta reportedly make money from their relationship. This breakeven partnership is based on mutual prestige, which seems hardly enough when looking at the massive 12-year, $1.1 billion deal Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the USGA signed in 2013.  The 2018 Masters also marks roughly 10 years since ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) took over Thursday and Friday coverage. Details about the deal aren't clear, but ESPN certainly dedicates a lot of resources to its nearly around-the-clock coverage.Fans can also watch nearly all of the coverage on Masters.com, which shows far more total hours than ESPN and CBS.SponsorsDelta (DAL  -  Free Report) became the newest official sponsor of the Masters last October. The airline’s addition brought the overall total to six. UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Mercedes-Benz, and Rolex all spend between $6 and $8 million a year, but have zero signage in view on the property.This investment grants the Masters’ partners the rights to split four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, which is far less time than most other sporting events. Three of the biggest sportswear giants, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will also all be on full display during the four-day tournament. Lastly, many of the players themselves will have a slew of corporate logos, from KPMG and other financial firms to golf companies such as Callaway (ELY  -  Free Report), all over their bodies.RatingsOf all the mystique surrounding the Masters, one thing that seems all too clear is that both CBS and ESPN hope this year’s tournament grabs better ratings.The Masters suffered it lowest TV ratings in 13 years in 2017. But this year’s event promises to be different because the sport’s biggest star, Tiger Woods, is back at Augusta—and this time he looks healthy.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1416,FOXA,"Investors in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 20, 2018 $24.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Twenty-First Century Fox shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Twenty-First Century Fox is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Film and Television Production and Distribution industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 57 cents per share to 56 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Twenty-First Century Fox right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1417,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Black Panther has once again gone on to prove that the best way to ensure box office success is to take the franchise route. Major studios are fast catching up with the trend and relying on franchise films, as these are attracting more audience than standalone movies.Of course, Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One has earned a robust $53.2 million since its opening in theatres on Wednesday, with $41.2 million coming from the three-day Easter weekend. Yet it’s clearly Black Panther that is roaring at the box office — set to become the third-highest grossing movie ever in the United States and Canada.In fact, Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi was the highest grossing film of 2017, while Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of Sony Corporation of America’s (SNE  -  Free Report), Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Marvel Studio’s Guardians of the Galaxy, were the fourth and fifth-highest grossing films, respectively. Needless to say, franchise films are working better and Black Panther with its dream run at the box office reestablishes the fact.Black Panther on Record-Breaking RaceReady Player One may have witnessed a great opening weekend, making it Time Warner, Inc.’s  Warner Bros.’s, first No. 1 debut this year. But it has taken seven weeks for any film since the release of Black Panther to actually reach there. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp’s  psychological thriller Acrimony opened better than expected raking in $17.2 million but is again no match to Black Panther.It isn’t that Black Panther’s success is a one-off instance for franchise films leading to higher ticket sales. The film has now earned $650.9 million in the domestic box office and $1.273 billion worldwide, accounting for 23% of all ticket sales in the first three months of the year, ending Saturday, according to comScore. And if everything goes the way it is, the film is on track to become the third-highest grossing movie ever in the United States and Canada.Moreover, Black Panther’s success has had a direct impact on other standalone films such as Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Red Sparrow, and Disney’s own A Wrinkle in Time, which have managed to collect a meager $45.7 million and $83.4 million, respectively.Franchise Power RulesThe success of franchise films was seen last year too, with Star Wars: The Last Jedi emerging as the highest grossing film. Its total domestic collections are more than $620 million as of Apr 1, 2018, making it the eight-highest grossing film of all time in the United States. Moreover, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,Guardians of the Galaxy and Sony’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, all franchises, took the No. 4, 5 and 6 spots in 2017 with box office collections of $402.8 million, $389.9 million and $334.2 million, respectively.And when these figures are compared with standalone films such as Fox’s Shape of Water and The Post, and Warner Bros’ Dunkirk, which shared the maximum Oscar nominations and wins among themselves this year, we find meager box office collections of $188 million, $63.5 million and $81.7 million, respectively.Disney Leads the Race Over the last few years, a lot of Disney’s success can be credited to the franchises it owns. The production house has time and again banked on its long list of franchises that have helped the company earn hefty box-office revenues. If Black Panther set the cash registers ringing this year, Disney had an enviable set of box-office winners in 2017 with the likes of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales all doing exceeding well.Moreover, from animation characters to the likes of Indiana Jones, Marvel Cinematic Universe characters and High School Musical, the company owns a wide array of franchises that have always helped it rake in healthy revenues. Among these, Marvel Comics characters such as Black Panther, Thor, Iron Man and Captain America are prized properties of Disney. In 2018, the film studio has an enviable line up of releases that include films like Ant-Man and the Wasp and Solo: A Star Wars Story.That said, other studios are also banking on the franchise power. Warner Bros. has franchises like Fantastic Beasts, Lord of the Rings and Matrix, while Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), has franchises such as Jurassic Park, The Fast and the Furious and The Mummy. However, Disney seems to be way ahead in the race. Currently, Disney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .In fact, ticket sales for films released by Disney Buena Vista studio accounts for a market share of more 31% of all ticket sales for 2018. And this again was driven by franchise films Black Panther, which brought in domestic sales of $631 million, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi that sold $103 million tickets in 2018. On the other hand, Columbia has a 14% market share of ticket sales this year, followed by 20th Century Fox with 13%. Comcast and Universal have 9% each and Warner has 9%.In ConclusionWhile it remains to be seen how Ready Player One performs in the coming weeks and if it can help Warner Bros. increase its market share of ticket sales, Black Panther continues to set new box office records. Interestingly, Ready Player One is Spielberg’s biggest opening since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, yet again a franchise film, which debuted in 2008 to $100.1 million. It now needs to be seen how Ready Player One  performs over the next few weeks till Disney’s next big superhero film Avengers: Infinity War releases on Apr 27. Disney with the maximum number of franchises is leading the race with the power of the Marvel Comics characters it owns. And understandably, once these franchises come to an end, the studio is expected to fall back on its old franchises.It goes without saying that, Black Panther’s success is only an attestation to popularity and command of franchise films at the box office. And all major film studios will keep relying on the franchise power to scoop up maximum revenues. Standalone films, which till a few years ago had their own appeal, definitely are losing out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1418,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into NCAA March Madness ratings ahead of Monday’s championship game. We then take a look at the money that fuels Major League Baseball, before diving into a Masters preview. Time Warner’s Turner  and CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) have seen their ratings fluctuate throughout the 2018 March Madness college basketball tournament, despite some favorable storylines. Meanwhile, MLB’s opening day has already come and gone in the shadow of college hoops. But as baseball’s popularity on a national level continues to decline, MLB is more profitable than ever. The New York Yankees are worth nearly $4 billion, and the average opening day salary was roughly $4.5 million.These big contracts come from ticket sales, as well as large local and national television broadcast deals. MLB teams around the country consistently post some of the best primetime ratings in their local markets, which is why Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and others spend billions on multi-year deals.MLB has also been on the cutting edge of streaming technology, as demonstrated by Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) majority acquisition of BAMTech. Furthermore, the league will continue its partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV during the 2018 season. Shifting gears one last time, we turn our attention to the Masters. Golf’s biggest tournament tees off this week on ESPN and CBS. The first major of the year has potential to be one of the sport’s biggest events in recent memory due to Tiger Woods’ return.Still, aside from the small amount of commercial time split between Delta (DAL  -  Free Report), UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), and Mercedes-Benz, the week-long event at Augusta National is known more for its lack of commercialism.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1419,FOXA,"In an effort to adapt to transformations in the media scenario and focus on growth prospects, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) announced streamlining of its operations into four segments. Evidently, it has created a direct-to-consumer and international business segment, and combined Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products into another unit. Meanwhile, the other two segments, Media Networks and Studio Entertainment, will almost remain the same.We expect the reorganization of its business to help this media behemoth focus on producing high quality content, increasing global foot print, technological modernization and most importantly direct-to-consumer distribution. However, following the news not much movement was witnessed in the stock price yesterday. In the past six months, the stock has gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 1.6%.Let’s discuss the company’s direct-to-consumer & international and parks, experiences & consumer products in details.High Hopes on Direct-to-Consumer & InternationalThe newly formed direct-to-consumer & international segment will be headed by Kevin Mayer, who has been the company’s chief strategy officer since 2015. This segment will consist of the company’s international media businesses, the direct-to-consumer businesses worldwide and Hulu streaming services.Further, Disney, which plans to launch its own streaming services, one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers will also be a part of the segment. Per management, the streaming services for ESPN will be launched this spring. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will lend an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games, annually. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis and college sports will also be streamed live. Meanwhile, the Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service is likely to be launched in late 2019.Additionally, global advertising sales for ABC, ESPN, Freeform and the Disney Channels, which were part of the Media Network, will now be under direct-to-consumer & international segment.Per Kevin Mayer, “Delivering our great stories and characters directly to consumers on all high-quality devices around the world will provide the Company with meaningful new revenue streams and opportunities for growth.”Parks, Experiences & Consumer ProductsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division, which has done exceedingly well in the recent past, will be combined with consumer products business. The segment will also include licensing and Disney stores. Bob Chapek will supervise the segment. According to Chapek, “Having worked with the exceptional teams at both Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products, I know this combination of incredible skills and resources will lead to a whole host of new creative ideas for high-quality products and experiences to delight our guests.”To ConcludeTechnological advancement is playing a major role in how people prefer to watch their favorite programs nowadays. Moreover, with new entertainment products and services available traditional media players are losing competitive leverage. Disney to an extent has been the victim of the same.Nevertheless, the company, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), Time Warner Inc.  and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), is taking steps to be more in sync with the contemporary. In fact, the company’s focus on producing high quality content, increasing global foot print, technological modernization and most importantly direct-to-consumer distribution, can be cited as one of the examples in that direction.Disney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1420,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the latest news surrounding the potentially game-changing sports gambling case, the headwinds facing ESPN’s new president, the big business of the NCAA, and much more.New York and over a dozen other states have joined New Jersey in its fight to legalize sports betting. At the same time, the NBA and MLB have started to lobby heavily around the country to make sure they get a piece of the action.Aside from the major professional sports leagues, gambling giants like MGM (MGM  -  Free Report) and William Hill WMH might benefit greatly from broader legality, while some tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Sony (SNE  -  Free Report) have filed sports betting patents.Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) has also been in the news recently after the company finally announced its new president. James Pitaro, who filled the vacancy left by John Skipper, joined the sports network at a rocky and highly important time.Pitaro’s first big challenges will be rolling out the company’s new streaming platform and dealing with low viewership numbers for some its prime programming, including SportsCenter and Monday Night Football. ESPN is also reportedly in a fight with Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) to bring Peyton Manning to the broadcast booth, which could help boost ratings.This week also marks the start of one of the richest and most popular months of sports television. NCAA March Madness is sure to draw a lot of attention as people fill out brackets all over the country—but also some criticism based on the money it makes from its massive TV deals with CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Turner .The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

(T  -  Free Report) will acquire Time Warner Inc.  for a consideration of $85.4 billion. The deal originated in October 2016 but was facing obstacles from the U.S. Department of Justice which argued that the proposed merger will give monopolistic power to AT&T in the converged platform of content creations and distribution. Both AT&T and Time Warner carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Following court’s approval of the AT&T – Time Warner Deal, cable TV and media giant Comcast Corp.

1422,FOXA,"Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as anticipated, didn’t lose any time to offer a higher price for 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets.As soon as AT&T got federal approval for Time Warner acquisition, the cable giant submitted a $65 billion bid for Fox’s assets, which is a 19% premium to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) $52.4 billion offer.The ball is now in Disney’s court. The media giant can wait for Fox’s board decision (vote on Jul 10 that is expected to be postponed now) or can immediately try to outbid Comcast’s $65 billion all-cash offer.Notably, since Disney’s announcement of the Fox deal (Dec 14, 2017), Comcast’s shares have lost 17.4%, as compared with Disney’s loss of 3.8%.  Who Will Fox Board & Shareholders Prefer?Apparently, the company, which pays more, will be preferred by both the Fox’s board and shareholders.In fact, a shareholder like TCI Fund Management, which owns almost 7.4% stake, per Reuters, believes that Fox’s board should sell the company to the highest bidder.Comcast’s current offer seems to be water tight. Per Reuters, apart from the premium bid, the company has offered $2.5 billion as a reverse termination fee, in case the deal fails to pass regulators.Notably, the reverse termination fee figure matches Disney’s offer. Additionally, Comcast will pay Fox’s breakup fee of $1.525 billion, which it would owe to Disney, if Fox’s board selects the cable giant.Nevertheless, Rupert Murdoch’s (Fox’s largest shareholder with roughly 17% stake) preference for an all-stock deal can become an obstacle for Comcast. The company’s all-cash offer will attract huge capital gain tax, per tax experts, as cited by Reuters.Will Disney Raise Bid?Per Bloomberg, Disney has the right of refusal on any counteroffer under its agreement with Fox. Moreover, if Fox’s board prefers Comcast, Disney will have five business days to respond.We believe Disney can raise its offer for Fox’s assets, given the significant synergies from the deal. The acquisition of majority of 21st Century Fox’s assets will significantly expand its content portfolio. Fox’s large library of TV shows and movies like The Simpsons and Avatar will also boost its competitive position against the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime.Further, Disney will have telecasting rights of Major League Baseball and NBA in the United States; Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League in the Europe; and Indian Premier League (IPL). The company’s international footprint will increase substantially by the addition of the aforementioned sports channels.Moreover, Fox Networks International operates more than 350 channels in 170 countries, while Star India has 69 channels serving 720 viewers per month. The international expansion will help Disney to negate a slowing U.S. television business.Comcast’s Debt Level to Shoot UpPer Reuters, Comcast already has “Highly Confident Letters” from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo for its 21st Century Fox bid. The “Highly Confident Letters” implies investment banking firms are confident about financing the deal.Notably, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s total debt was $66.72 billion compared with $59.42 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. Comcast’s debt level is now further expected to increase, due to the higher bid for Fox as well as a $30 billion (£ 20 billion) offer for U.K.-based Pay-TV provider, Sky, in which Disney has also shown interest.Per Bloomberg, if Comcast successfully acquires Fox and Sky, it could become one of America’s largest corporate borrowers. Rating agency Moody's has already warned that it may cut Comcast's A3 rating, citing higher debt levels.Disney, on the contrary, has significantly less borrowings under its balance sheet compared with Comcast. As of Mar 31, 2018, total borrowings were $24.68 billion.Moreover, Disney has a debt-equity ratio of 38.6% compared with Comcast’s 90.1%. Hence, the balance sheet strength provides ample opportunity to Disney to raise its bid for Fox’s assets.Zacks RankCurrently, both Disney and Comcast have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1424,FOXA,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FOXA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.21st Century Fox Q2 Earnings & Sales Beat EstimatesTwenty-First Century Fox delivered better-than-expected earnings for the seventh straight quarter, when it reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at 42 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. However, earnings declined 20.8% year over year.Including one-time items, earnings came in at 99 cents a share compared with 46 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Notably, the top line not only increased 5% year over year but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter. Revenues of $8,037 million came ahead of the consensus mark of $7,968 million on account of robust affiliate and advertising revenues at the Cable Network Programming, marginally offset by decline in revenues at Television segment. It was also aided by increase in syndication revenues at the Cable Network Programming. Segment wise, Cable Network Programming revenues jumped 11% to $4,405 million on the back of robust affiliate as well as advertising revenue growth, which overshadowed 15% gain in costs. Rise in expenses was primarily due to higher global sports programming costs.Filmed Entertainment revenues were down 1% to $2,246 million, while Television segment net revenues decreased 5.8% to $1,806 million, both on a year-over-year basis.    The company’s total segment operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) came in at $1,438 million, down 27.9% year over year. Increase in OBIDA from Cable Network Programming was negated by decline in OIBDA from Television, Film Entertainment and Other, Corporate and Eliminations.Detailed DiscussionOIBDA at Cable Network Programming rose 2.6% to $1,365 million owing to 11% increase in revenues. The increase was partially offset by 15% rise in expenses on account of increase in global sports programming costs.OIBDA contribution from domestic rose 1% year over year due to increase in contribution form Fox News, which mitigated dismal performance at domestic sports networks as well as National Geographic. At the domestic cable channels, affiliate revenues grew 12% owing to rise in contractual rate across all domestic brands. Domestic advertising revenues declined 3% year over year primarily due to fall in general entertainment ratings.OIBDA contribution from International cable channels jumped 8% year over year as strong performance at FNG International and STAR entertainment networks overshadowed decline at STAR sports networks. Affiliate revenues advanced 13% owing to increase in rates and subscribers growth at both FNG International as well as STAR India. International advertising revenues rose 14% primarily owing to high-double digit advertising growth at STAR India and improvement at FNG International.Filmed Entertainment’s OIBDA slumped 66% to $131 million on account of higher theatrical releasing costs.Television segment’s OIBDA plunged 85% to $56 million on account of increase in contractual sports programming costs at the FOX Broadcast Network and lower revenues. Other Financial DetailsTwenty-First Century Fox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,809 million.

1425,FOXA,"On Tuesday, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hit its third successive all-time high of $325.27. The streaming video giant had already enjoyed a strong showing on Monday, powered by its second-ever Oscar win for the documentary Icarus. In contrast, other major media names mopped up only meager gains despite garnering multiple awards.More importantly, shares of Netflix have surged nearly 70% year to date, edging out larger tech names like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), which have gained only 31.5%, 4.4%, 9.1% and 4.5%, respectively over the same period.But does the stock’s price have further room for improvement in the days ahead? A wide swathe of analysts believes that the stock has the potential to move even higher in 2018. A carefully built up competitive moat and the rapid adoption of ultra-HD content are some of the reasons that could fuel Netflix’s ascent in the days ahead.Oscars’ Biggest Winner?On Monday, Netflix’s stock gained 4.6% after it picked up its second Oscar in the documentary category. The prestige factors must surely have added to the sheen of the stock since the real big winners on Academy Awards night had little to show for their efforts in terms of price gains.Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Time Warner , Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) Universal all picked up multiple awards. But each of these companies’ shares failed to increase more than 1% on Monday during a session when the Dow gained nearly 1.5%. Meanwhile, Netflix notched up another 3.2% gain on Tuesday. Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Competitive Moat, Ultra-HD Adoption to Drive UpsideOf course, there is another section of analysts which believe that movies are only incidental to Netflix’s larger game plan, give its massive library of original content, Netflix is planning to spend almost $8 billion on producing its own content in 2018. This is a substantial jump from the $6 billion that it spent on content in 2017.Analysts at UBS AG (UBS  -  Free Report) believe that investment in original content is one of the major factors which have helped Netflix to build a formidable competitive moat. And this moat is one of global proportions. Going forward, analysts at the Wall Street firms think that Netflix has created a virtuous circle for itself since its international success reduces the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing fresh subscribers.This is UBS has revised its price target for Netflix upward, from $290 to $345. Meanwhile, analysts at Macquarie have revised their Netflix price target higher for a completely different reason. This firm believes that the widespread proliferation of ultra-HD content will help Netflix gain further headroom.Since Netflix charges a $4 premium over its standard service for ultra-HD content, this is likely to result in higher revenues. On Monday, Macquarie’s 12-month price target stood at $330.Does Netflix Sport Sufficient Upside?With the stock gaining a searing 69.4% year to date, the only factor working against it at this point is valuations. With a PEG ratio of 4.06, Netflix is clearly pricier than the S&P 500, which has a PEG ratio of 1.81.However, its median PEG ratio over a five year time span is 5.08. Additionally, it high a peak PEG value of 23.60 during the fourth quarter of 2015, which means that it remains pricey but has further room to run.Also, the ongoing market rally has dispelled such concerns over valuation time and time again. Tech majors have delivered ever stronger earnings performances, as was in evidence during Netflix’s fourth quarter results, to justify such exorbitant valuations. The company added 8.3 million subscribers (highest in history), much more than the expected 6.3 million, which shows how attractive its portfolio is to consumers.In ConclusionOver the last three months, Netflix’s Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 19.3%. Additionally, its expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100%. Meanwhile, its stock remains pricey but well below its peak or even median valuation levels over a five year span.Given these factors, Netflix is likely to surge even higher in 2018 on the back of its strong original content and international subscriber additions. This makes it a great option for investors going forward.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

1426,FOXA,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three. According to data from the CME Group, odds of four rate hikes by year-end rose to 33% on Tuesday from about 20% on Monday.For the time being, Powell maintained that the Fed would keep to its plan of hiking rates three times this year. But, he did mention that “we’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target”.Following a three-day long rally, all the key U.S. indexes declined as investors remained wary of an increase in the pace of rate hikes. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their worst daily performance in percentage terms since Feb 8. The Dow registered a slump of more than 300 points. For the S&P 500 index, all the 11 sectors finished in the red, with the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors emerging as the biggest drags on the S&P 500.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 2.14%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (REIT) (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively.Additionally, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) decreased 2.12%, which was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500.

1427,FOXA,"The Oscars 2018 race is in its last leg and the final results will be announced this weekend. Naturally, cine buffs across the globe are waiting with bated breath. And so are film studios, as winning the coveted statuette lifts the fortunes of big players.A film’s box office collection immediately increases after the nominations and a win gives it a further boost.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which set new box office records and managed to collect more than $618 million as of Feb 25, 2018, has managed to earn only four nominations. Interestingly, despite 27 nominations, Fox came in fourth in 2017, in terms of total domestic box office gross.Oscar Nominations Boost RevenuesIt goes without saying that box office results are not deciding factors when it comes to winning an Oscar. But a win definitely gives box-office collection a renewed thrust. An Oscar win creates more interest among filmgoers, which make producers look for more avenues to maximize revenues by releasing the film in more theatres. Not only a win, in fact, just an Oscar nomination is enough to shower fortunes on a film.According to ticketing site Fandango, which compared the nominees’ total sales for the entire day of Jan 22, a day before the Oscar nominations were announced, total sales for Shape of Water saw a 241% increase in ticket sales during the entire day of Jan 23. Meanwhile, ticket sales for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri shot up 102%. On the other hand, The Post and Darkest Hour ticket sales saw the lowest increases of 46% each, still a huge jump. This is a clear indication of the impact that Oscar nominations have on future ticket sales.Beyond the StudiosIt’s not only the studios that have a lot at stake pre and post Oscars. The Academy Awards mean a lot to others behind a film’s win. This has become increasingly true since going to the movies has become a whole new experience altogether and the audience is ready to shell out more for a better experience that 3D or Imax offers. Imax Corporation (IMAX  -  Free Report) certainly has been a game changer when it comes to movie watching. By late 2017, as many as 1,302 Imax theatre systems were installed in 1,203 commercial multiplexes worldwide.Of the Imax films nominated this year, Dunkirk and Blade Runner 2049 lead the pack, with eight and five nominations, respectively. In total, Imax has 11 films with a total of 26 nominations, including money churners like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast.Another company that will have its eyes glued on Oscars is Dolby Laboratories . Today, the majority of films studios depend on Dolby for better sound. This year, the company has as many as 12 films nominated for the Oscars in various categories.Revenue-Churning MachineThe wait for the star-studded Oscar night is just days away and studios are anxious about the final announcement. A number of big films are already fighting it out for the top spot in different categories, which will finally decide the fortunes of the film studios. Much like the nominations, which saw a rise in ticket sales of most of the films making it to the list, the winners too are expected to push up revenues for the respective studios.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?

1428,FOXA,"Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) newest Marvel superhero film, Black Panther, crushed initial projections and brought in roughly $240 million at domestic box offices over the weekend. This strong start to the current fiscal quarter was just what Disney needed as it has seen its Studio Entertainment unit revenues decline in recent quarters.The film, which stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, and Lupita Nyong'o, boasted an estimated budget of $200 million, and early projections called for between $100 million and $120 million in opening weekend sales for the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Expectations were eventually raised to $170 million after a ton of pre-sale tickets were sold and commercial and social media hype increased.Black Panthereventually earned a total of $242 million at 4,020 North American locations, which topped the four-day domestic opening total for Star Wars: The Last Jedi to move into second-place all-time. The film now sits behind only Disney’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens.The movie also recorded the fifth-largest opening weekend ever. Black Panther performed well internationally too, bringing in $184.6 million abroad—led by strong sales in South Korea and the U.K. In total, the blockbuster brought in $426.6 million worldwide.The strong opening weekend could spell more stellar numbers down the road as the film continues to receive great critical feedback, with a 96% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. Black Panther’s debut also proceeds what Disney hopes will be a string of 2018 hits, including A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2, and Ant-Man and the Wasp.Last year proved to be a rough year for Disney’s Studio Entertainment segment after it landed major wins in 2016. In fiscal 2017, Studio Entertainment sales slipped by 11% to $8.38 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, segment revenues dipped marginally (also read: Disney Q1 Earnings Beat, Parks & Resorts Leads the Way).Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has earned 10 earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for fiscal 2018, as well as seven for the following year.Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, Disney is expected to see its revenues hit $58.88 billion, which would mark a 6.80% year-over-year jump, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is also projected to expand its bottom-line by nearly 21.93%. The company is projected to see its sales surge nearly 6% in the current quarter, while its earnings are expected to expand by 12%—both of which could easily be raised since Black Panther blew past initial box-office estimates.Looking ahead, Disney will continue to lean on Marvel for box-office growth even if its massive 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) deal is approved. A successful new series in the giant Marvel Universe will also help the company as it starts its own over-the-top streaming platform to compete against the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).And finally, due to the recent market-wide selloff, shares of Disney rest over 9% below their 52-week high, which means investors might consider scooping up the entertainment giant as its big-name titles become more valuable in a highly competitive media landscape.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1429,FOXA,"The camera has started rolling and another great film is likely in the making. The 2018 box office seems on track with Marvel Studios’, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), Black Panther heading for a record-breaking box office weekend.Things certainly look rosy, with industry experts and analysts predicting that the film could fetch as much as $145 million in the domestic market only, in its opening weekend. That, indeed, is an astounding figure. But that’s the new normal for all Marvel Studios productions! Disney has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Black Panther Sets the Ball Rolling for 2018Interestingly, Marvel Studios has emerged as the most sought-after brand with each of its 17 films in the last 10 years opening at number one, collecting more than $13.5 billion and setting new box-office records. This year also marks Marvel Studios’ 10th anniversary. Disney certainly has a lot of hopes pinned on Black Panther given that the film will also enjoy the four-day long President’s Day Weekend.  Analysts are optimistic too with the opinion that it will garner more than $160 billion.Given this scenario, the Chadwick Boseman-starrer might set a new February-opening weekend record, leaving behind Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Deadpool, which made $132 billion in 2016.  Needless to say, Disney has been having a dream run at the box office. And if the $52.4 billion deal to acquire Fox’s film and television arms, as well as regional sports networks, (which Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) too has placed a bid) falls in place, Disney’s movie business is only expected to go from strength to strength.Box Office Topper in 2017     Disney ended 2017 on a high with Star Wars: The Last Jedi debuting with the second biggest opening weekend at the domestic box office in the history, trailing only behind its 2015 predecessor Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Thefilm’s total domestic collections have been more than $617 million as of Feb 13, 2018 and more than $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the eight highest grossing film of all time in the United States. In fact, Disney has been tasting box office success for quite a while now. The last couple of years, 2016 and 2017, have been exceptionally great for the production behemoth.According to box office tracker comScore, Disney emerged the box office winner for the second year in a row in 2017, with revenues of $2.41 billion. Warner Bros., a division of Time Warner Inc  took the number two spotgarneringrevenues of $2.03 billion.Similarly, 2016 too had seen Disney registering robust revenues of $2.85 billion, while Warner Bros. was way behind with $1.88 billion. That makes the picture quite clear with the difference between the first and second position being almost $1 billion. And if these figures are not enough to tell the entire story, Disney released a lesser number of films compared with other Hollywood studios, with only 16 and 12 titles in 2016 and 2017, respectively.Warner Bros. on the other hand released 31 films in 2017. Universal Studios and Fox came in third and fourth with revenues of $1.53 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively. In fact, these two studios also released more titles than Disney. While Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast, released 17 titles, Fox had as many as 38 films hitting theatres in 2017.Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of Sony Corporation of America (SNE  -  Free Report), was the fifth-best performer, registering revenues of $1.06 billion. The studio released 23 titles, of which Spider-Man: Homecoming was the best, making $334 million. Lionsgate Entertainment Corp  came in sixth with only $885.1 million despite 31 releases.Undoubtedly, Disney stands heads and shoulders above the competition. With only half the number of releases compared with other Hollywood studios and attractive revenue figures in the last two years, it can safely be said that most of Disney films struck the right chord at the box office. And this has been primarily because of the successful franchises the studio possesses.Cashing in on Franchise PowerTime and again, it has been proved that franchisees have enjoyed a different kind of popularity. From Disney animation characters to the likes of Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, Marvel Cinematic Universe characters and High School Musical, the company owns a wide array of franchises that have always helped it rake in healthy revenues.In fact, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the highest grossing film of all time at the domestic box office. It also holds the records for biggest opening day at the domestic box office and biggest opening weekend at the domestic box office. Black Panther, with more than 5 million tweets has been declared by Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) as the most tweeted film of the year before its release.Warner Bros, on the other hand, despite having prized franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Matrix is way behind Disney both in numbers and performance of its titles at the box office. The same hold true for Universal that has franchises like Jurassic Park, The Fast and the Furious and The Mummy films. The only other studio that comes close to Disney in this regard is Fox. So we can well presume what is about to come if Disney finally acquires Fox assets. First, the acquisition will give the company complete ownership of all Marvel characters under the Fox banner such as the Deadpool, the Fantastic Four and the X-Men. Moreover, Disney gets to enjoy the enviable 80-year film library created by Fox with Avatar topping the list followed by genre films like Alien, Ice Age, Planet of the Apes and Predator.All this will be a formidable addition to Disney’s already enviable lineup of releases in 2018. Black Panther is already heading for a great start and the coming months will see popular franchises like Avengers: Infinity War, Solo: A Star Wars Story, The Incredibles 2 hitting the theatres.A Great Year AheadThe production giant seems to be carrying on from where it had left in 2017 with an attractive bouquet of tiles slated for release. And if the Fox acquisition falls in place, the performance is expected to touch the sky, only to widen the huge gap between Disney and other studios.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1430,FOXA,"CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.

Content licensing and distribution revenues also surged 33% to $1,191 million owing to robust growth from domestic as well as international licensing sales. However, total advertising revenues decreased 3% to $1,745 primarily due to decline in political advertising sales.Despite year-over-year rise in top and bottom line, not much movement was witnessed in after-hours trading on Feb 15.

1431,FOXA,"Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) has signed a five-year deal worth around $300 million with Ryan Murphy, the name behind popular series’ like American Horror Story and Glee. Reportedly, Murphy is ending his tenure with Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) where he has been working since 2003 to join Netflix in July.Earlier in September, Netflix collaborated with Murphy to bring a two-season 18 episode series, Ratched, that traces the origin of Nurse Ratched of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. A comedy series named The Politician produced by Murphy is also in the making.The addition of Murphy will definitely provide an impetus to Netflix’s original content expansion strategy. Last year, the streaming giant signed a contract with Shonda Rhimes, a long-time Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) associate, to produce original content exclusively for Netflix.We believe these additions will help Netflix to maintain its dominant market share going forward. Walt Disney is set to enter the streaming market in 2019 and its recent deal with Twenty-First Century Fox is expected to be a major catalyst to growth. However, Netflix doesn’t see this as a threat.Talking about the Disney-Fox merger, recently, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos was quoted saying, “one of the reasons we entered into original programming was that if we got to the place where networks didn't want to sell us their content in second windows, that we would be replacing that with our own -- by creating our own original programming.”Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Netflix, Inc. QuoteFocus on Original ContentNetflix’s continued focus on producing quality original content is driving its top line. The company’s strong programming slate is helping it attract and retain subscribers.In the last reported quarter, Netflix added 8.33 million subscribers (highest in its history), of which 6.36 million came from the International streaming business. The figure is impressive, considering that Netflix hiked prices in Europe and the United States by almost 10%.In January, Netflix released a new sci-fi series Altered Carbon and a six-episode chat show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. The guest list of the talk show includes influential personalities like Barack Obama, George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey and Howard Stern.A new coming-of-age high school comedy series set in the 1990s called Everything Sucks is also set for a Feb 16 release.The company also mentioned its upcoming projects on the last earnings call. The second seasons of Marseille, Jessica Jones, Santa Clarita Diet and Lemony Snicket are due this quarter.Notably, Netflix plans to release 30 international original series this year, including programs from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. The company intends to produce/acquire 80 films throughout the year.Netflix has set a budget of $7.5-$8 billion for production/acquisition of original content in 2018. Management expects this figure to increase in 2019 and 2020.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderNetflix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Micron is projected to be 10%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1432,FOXA,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come.NBC outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights. The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future-looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc. (SNAP).One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase. This year, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Famers Insurance, Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and many others are official NBC partners.But there are also 13 top dogs: the firms that spend over $100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors. This list includes Visa V, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), along with recently added tech giants Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC—which will give fans a taste of its virtual reality capabilities from Pyeongchang.The Olympics are also a time for companies and apparel brands to attach themselves to athletes. Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) outfitted Team USA with gear for the opening ceremonies, while medal winners will sport Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on the podiums. Even Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) got back in the action after some athletes panned its gear in 2014.And this year’s games were awarded to South Korea, due in large part to a push from the former head of one of the world’s most well-known technology companies.

1433,FOXA,"Markets slipped into a correction on Thursday after a 1,000 point decline in the Dow. Both the S&P 500 and the blue-chip index closed 10% below their respective record closes on Jan 26. Further, the CBOE Volatility Index surged once again after declining for two straight sessions. Meanwhile, market watchers speculated a possible government shutdown would ensue if the budget deal is not passed by the Senate. Finally, the initial jobless claims hit a 45-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46. However, the S&P 500 fell 3.8% to close at 2,581. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,777.16, losing 3.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 31.76.A total of around 10.6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.2 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by an 8.26 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets in Correction, Major Stocks Pull BackThe Dow suffered severe losses after plummeting as much as 1,033 points on Thursday. This is the blue-chip index’s second decline by over 1,000 points during this week. Such a dip also led the Dow to finish 10.4% off its record close on Jan 26, 2018, charting its second-biggest decline in terms of points since its inception.Also, this marked its third decline by more than 500 points in a matter of five days. The blue-chip index finished at its lowest level since Nov 28, 2017 and is set to post its worst weekly decline since October 2008. Despite these losses, the Dow still managed to finish above its lowest close for the week of 23,778.74 that it hit on Tuesday.Losses for the Dow were broad based. Shares of American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 5.6%, 5.4% and 4.4%, respectively, contributing majorly to the Dow’s losses.The S&P 500 bled 100.7 points to end in negative territory, finishing 10.2% off its all-time high. This was it lowest close for the week, finishing below the 2,600 level and falling below its 100-day moving average. The broader index has dipped more than 2% over three of the last five sessions.All of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended in negative territory, with financial and technology shares leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 4.4% and 4.1%, respectively.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq tanked 275 points to end in the red after a bloodbath in the tech shares. Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) plummeted 4.8%, 4.7% and 5.1%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader markets suffered huge losses on Thursday following concerns over increasing market volatility, a possible surge in inflation which might lead to a rate hike and an increase in bond yields. Analysts also stated that this correction was just a pullback from massive gains scored for the major part of 2017 and the first month of 2018. Market watchers also speculated a government shutdown would come about if the Senators do not pass the budget deal by midnight.CBOE VIX Rears its Ugly Head AgainHaving fallen for two consecutive sessions, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged almost 24% in intraday trade to 34.48. However, the fear gauge mellowed down to 14.5% by the end of the session. The index of market uncertainty has shown severe fluctuations over the week, highlighting the frenzy that market watchers have gone through over this period. Such panic has arisen primarily out of speculations regarding a hike in inflation even as the economy has been burgeoning.Possibility of Partial Federal ShutdownLeaders from Congress announced on Wednesday that they had agreed upon a two-year budget deal to end the uncertainty regarding government spending and immigration laws. Such tensions had led to a government shutdown earlier in the month. Agreement on the budget legislation came months after both Republicans and Democrats tried to reach a consensus on the deal.The deal seeks to increase federal spending by $300 billion over the next two years. This would exceed the ceiling that was imposed by in 2011. The deal increases military spending by $80 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year through September and further by $85 billion in fiscal 2019. This comes over and above the emerging war funds of about $140 billion.The new agreement also seeks to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program by 10 years and spare another $80 billion for disaster relief funding. Moreover, the legislation also beefs up non-defense spending by $63 billion for this year and by $68 billion for 2019.The future of the deal is uncertain as it requires the support from the Democrats, who are expected to out rightly oppose any surge in government spending. Further, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants a vote in favor of the protection of undocumented immigrants termed as ‘Dreamers’, in return for voting in favor of the budget spending. This issue has gone unaddressed in the $300 billion deal. Finally, if the deal is not passed by the midnight, the U.S. is headed for another partial federal shutdown.Jobless Claims near a 45-Year LowInitial jobless claims for the last week came in at 221,000 as opposed to 230,000 for the previous period. The consensus estimate for the current period was 233,000. The monthly average of the jobless claims plummeted 10,000 to 224,500 on Thursday. This marks its lowest level since March 1973.Stocks That Made HeadlinesViacom Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Decrease Y/YViacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017), wherein earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

At News UK, News Corp Australia and Dow Jones the top line increased 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively. However, at News America Marketing the metric decreased 16%. Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues declined 5% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues fell 6% due to soft home delivered revenues at News America Marketing, mainly attributable to two fewer free-standing inserts as well as lower custom publishing revenues. Also, softness in the print advertising market along with the decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions in the quarter impacted the results. These were somewhat mitigated by contributions from the buyout of ARM, a modest growth of advertising revenues at News UK, and foreign currency tailwinds.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 6% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones, reflecting nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues, persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business. Furthermore, the contributions from ARM buyout, rise in cover and subscription price, and favorable currency impact aided revenue growth. The improvement was partly compensated with diminished newsstand volume at News UK.In the quarter under review, digital revenues accounted for 29% of segment revenues compared with 26% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 7% to $134 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $469 million, up 1% from the prior-year period.

Also, adjusted EBITDA grew 22% to $115 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $120 million, up 15% on account of the buyout of ANC and rise in affiliate revenue at FOX SPORTS Australia.

1436,FOXA,"On Jun 12, a federal judge cleared the way, allowing AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to acquire Time Warner Inc.  for $85 billion. The long-awaited judgment certainly has brought a sigh of relief for Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the company on Jun 13 announced a $65 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets that are at presently in the process of an agreement to be acquired by The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report).This certainly has paved the way for a media consolidation at a time when online streaming giants like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are fast invading their space and changing the entire ballgame. As the directors of Fox vote for the Disney deal on Jul 10, it now needs to be seen how the media landscape shapes up in the days to come.AT&T and Time Warner Deal Helps Comcast  Comcast finally placed an all-cash bid of $65 billion to acquire Fox’s television and film assets, in a move to derail Disney pending deal of $52.4 billion. It goes without saying that Comcast was waiting for the judgment on AT&T’s bid to acquire Time Warner after the Justice Department had sued to block the merger.The recent judgment certainly has given Comcast the confidence to bid for Fox’s television and film assets, which is at a 19% premium to Disney’s offer. However, before entering into a deal with Disney, Fox had rejected Comcast’s offer to buy its assets, citing it as too risky despite the bid being higher. Comcast’s recent announcement definitely is a fresh challenge to both Fox and Disney.Comcast has graduated from a cable television giant to a diversified media company. Taking over Fox makes sense to Comcast at a time when its rivals are scaling up. Charter Communication, Inc. (CHTR) is already working on mobile expansion, while AT&T buying out Time Warner is in a move to enhance its pay TV and digital content. Given this scenario, taking over Fox will only strengthen Comcast’s broadcasting arm.Media Convergence in the Works?Price Performance (Year to Date)The biggest story amid all these is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money. The Justice Department’s argument was that AT&T could use its new position to exorbitantly raise the prices on cable operators that want to run Time Warner programs.However, AT&T will now be able to directly compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. At the same time, it will also allow the mobile-phone giant to create fair competition among cable operators and increase the cost of visual entertainment, thus consolidating the entire media ballgame.Understandably, the acquisition war is a survival strategy. Amazon and Netflix are taking the game away from traditional broadcasters, with television becoming almost obsolete. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In fact, Netflix has already said that it will dedicate $8 billion in 2018 solely to content. Also, Comcast’s decision to add Netflix to its bundled offering further proves the growing demand for online content. Given this scenario, it makes sense for broadcasting giants to only diversify their portfolio.Moreover, the merger might further pose a fresh challenge to the likes of Alphabet, Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google and Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), which dominate the online advertising space. If AT&T now decides to combine it broadband, mobile and Direct TV services with Time Warner’s films, television shows and sporting events, it could further intensify competition with tech companies.  5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1437,FOXA,"Exactly three weeks after Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) made its most recent plans to acquire a valuable array of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets known, the cable and internet giant announced its official offer Wednesday afternoon. Comcast outbid Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) as the fight to remain dominant in the new age of entertainment heats up. Now let’s quickly examine Comcast’s offer and explain why it’s so important. Comcast offered to buy a massive chunk of Fox’s entertainment and international assets for $65 billion, which the company said marked a 19% premium compared to Disney’s all-stock offer worth $52.4 billion. Comcast’s latest offer comes after Fox turned down its previous offer, citing regulatory concerns.  But today looks like a whole new world after a federal judge approved the AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  merger on Tuesday. A move that sets up what could turn into not only a bidding war between Disney and Comcast for Fox but also lays the foundation for a string of other mergers.“We are also highly confident that our proposed transaction will obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and that our transaction is as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction,” Comcast wrote in a letter to Fox. “Accordingly, we are offering the same regulatory commitments as the ones 21CF has already obtained from Disney, including the same $2.5 billion reverse termination fee agreed to by Disney.”Comcast also noted that “time is of the essence” because Fox scheduled its vote on the Disney merger proposal for July 10.The AssetsThe Fox assets that both Disney and Comcast hope to acquire include almost everything but Fox News, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, and a few others. Rupert Murdoch is selling Fox's movie and TV production assets, cable networks such as FX Networks, and popular entertainment properties including X-Men and Avatar.Furthermore, the potential deal is set to include two major satellite distributors, Sky in Europe and Star in India, as well as Fox’s stake in Hulu—which would give Disney a controlling stake in the streaming power that competes directly against Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Why It Matters Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, hopes to bolster its content offerings as the media landscape shifts rapidly. The deal would also theoretically make Comcast’s hugely popular cable and internet bundles look more enticing. The company’s move looks even more vital now that the AT&T-Time Warner merger was approved.  Disney’s plan is similar: expand its content portfolio. The company bought ABC back in 1996 for nearly $20 billion. Since then, the entertainment powerhouse has gone after much smaller assets that have played an extremely valuable role, including Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, and most recently Lucasfilm—amounting to a total of $16 billion.These acquisitions have turned Disney into a studio entertainment juggernaut, they will also play a key role in Disney’s new standalone streaming service that is set to launch in late 2019—as Disney waits for some of its current Netflix contracts to expire. The company’s streaming services becomes much more attractive with Fox’s movie and TV studios attached.Stock Movement Shares of Fox closed up 7.70% at $43.66 per share on Wednesday, after hitting a new all-time high during intraday trading. Disney stock gained 1.90%, while Comcast slipped marginally.Investors will also see that shares of Disney and Comcast have sunk over the last year, with Comcast down big. Meanwhile, Fox has seen its stock price soar, spurred in part by Disney’s December 2017 offer.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1438,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday without team USA for the first time since 1986, which is a huge disappointment for first time broadcast partner Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). But American soccer fans woke up Wednesday to news that North America won the rights to host the 2026 World Cup, beating out Morocco. Here is everything you need to know about the bid, its economic impact, and what companies stand to benefit. Hint: Fox is already celebrating.North America FIFA announced, in a 134 to 65 vote, to award the 2026 World Cup to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico’s joint bid. The reasons here are pretty simple: money. North America is expected generate $14 billion in revenue and $11 billion in profits for FIFA, which is huge for an organization that makes 90% of its money from the World Cup—Morocco reportedly couldn’t offer half of that figure. Soccer’s largest governing body was also under pressure after awarding the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to more controversial hosts, Russia and Qatar.The North American bid included 23 host city candidates, including three from Canada, three from Mexico, with the rest spread out throughout the U.S. Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York/New Jersey are the three cities vying for the rights to host the final.Under the current plan, the U.S. is set to host 60 matches, with Canada and Mexico each set to hold 10. If that number seems a little off to some soccer fans, it’s because the 2026 World Cup will see the world’s biggest sporting event expand its field for the first time to 48 teams up from 32, for a total of 80 matches—up from 64 under the current format.The North American bid noted that it expects the top six games, which would mean the opening games in all three countries, along with the two semifinals, and the final, to compare favorably to Super Bowl ticket sales as well as overall hospitality figures. The committee projects the overall economic impact will be roughly $5 billion, with $5.8 billion worth of ticket sales expected.Companies The clear winner of the 2026 World Cup bid is Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two broadcast powers won the U.S. television rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments for roughly $1 billion combined back in 2011. Then, somewhat quietly in 2015, FIFA awarded Fox and Telemundo the rights to the 2026 World Cup without opening up the bidding. The move sparked outrage from ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and other networks..@FOXSports President and COO Eric Shanks on North America winning the bid for #WorldCup 2026: ""It's a tremendous day, a lot of hard has paid off."" https://t.co/nbcpI3ZFCB pic.twitter.com/ysVfKbOTrR— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) June 13, 2018Fox reportedly only paid 10% more than in its current $425 million contract. On its face, this was a somewhat crazy move because Fox had not even broadcast its first World Cup game at the time, and no one knew what country would host the 2026 tournament. Diving a little deeper, the answer is somewhat clear. FIFA didn’t want any legal trouble from Fox, since, in a shocking move, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be hosted in the fall or winter due to heat concerns, which directly conflicts with the NFL season and other programming.Fox and Telemundo now own the rights to the world’s biggest sporting event on home soil. And this means live games in primetime, which is a trully amazing opportunity that likely has Fox, Telemundo, and FIFA’s marketing partners giddy. In a media landscape driven more and more by the Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) of the world, a month of adverting live in primetime is almost invaluable. Current FIFA and World Cup sponsors, which spend upwards of $50 million a year, include Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY and more. With that said, major U.S.-based companies now have even more incentive to get in on the World Cup.Aside from big opportunities for staples like Nike NKE, it could be a chance for Under Armour UAA to break into the World Cup scene via a team-based sponsorship, while everyone from YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report) to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other tech companies could work their way in somehow. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and other giants are current official sponsors of U.S. Soccer. Bottom Line Soccer has been the supposed sport of the future in the U.S. since it hosted the 1994 World Cup. Today, the world’s most popular sport sits just behind baseball and basketball as Americans’ favorite sport, according to a Gallup poll (basketball was favored by 11%, with baseball at 9%).Meanwhile, soccer jumped up to 7%—its highest spot ever on the annual poll. And a lot can change in eight years, especially as money pours into the MLS and the NFL’s ratings decline.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1440,FOXA,"Following yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) read for May which came in-line with analyst estimates, this morning’s Producer Price Index (PPI), the other side of the supply/demand equation, was higher than expected: +0.5% for May, up from the 0.3% expected and the CPI’s 0.2%. Stripping out volatile food & energy costs, this figure reaches +0.3%.What we’re seeing here is unmistakeable growth. Compare the May PPI with the headline reads from April, for instance: those were +0.1% and +0.2%, respectively. Year over year, PPI is up 3.1%, hotter than the expected 2.8% and the 2.8% year-over-year CPI total. Ex-food & energy (aka “core”) reached 2.4% year over year on PPI. As with the CPI, the Energy sector led the way with more than 4% growth in pricing, otherwise known as inflation.How Will the Fed React?We all know by now that the Fed funds rate will increase another 25 basis points to a still-historically-low range of 1.75%-2.00%. This news is expected around 1pm Central Time today. It will be the first time interest rates will have touched 2% since prior to the Great Recession, nearly a decade ago.That said, analysts still expect another quarter-point rate hike in the Fed’s September meeting, which will have been the third raise in calendar 2018. But what of a fourth rate hike in December? Perhaps inflationary reads like we’re seeing from today’s PPI numbers may cause the Fed to be more proactive in raising rates, which would have the dual purpose of sopping up encroaching inflation and keeping rates high enough that pulling them back meaningfully during the next economic downturn would keep us from getting stuck in the mud.There is almost no discussion whether the Fed might instead consider a raise of 50 basis points (0.5%) instead of the 25 bps hikes we’ve seen since climbing out of the economic abyss. But perhaps the language in the Fed’s statement may take a somewhat hawkish turn, foreshadowing more aggressive policy considerations down the road. And if you don’t know where to look for such analysis, don’t worry — there is a veritable cottage industry of parsing through Fed statements with tweezers and a fine-toothed comb, including here at Zacks.AT&T/Time Warner Deal Goes Through — What’s Next?Following yesterday’s announcement that the proposed merger between telecom giant AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and content major Time Warner  — which originally made headlines back when Barack Obama was still president — has been approved by a federal district court judge, we now expect an offer from cable behemoth Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) for assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) content, according to sources reporting to CNBC’s David Faber this morning.Complicating matters is the competing interest of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) to purchase Fox assets, meaning we might be looking for a bidding war between Comcast and Disney, depending on what today’s initial offer is. Disney would have five days to come back and match Comcast’s proposal.As a result, both DIS and CMCSA shares are down in today’s pre-market, while FOXA is up more than 7%.

(AAPL  -  Free Report) to foray into the telecom space has intensified the competitionPay-TV Industry Facing Survival Threat  Exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high-end smartphone and tablet devices, has altered the entire dynamics of the traditional pay-TV industry.Consumer preference has shifted from costlier legacy cable TV connections to low-cost over-the-top (OTT) video streaming service, resulting in significant cord cutting. Tech giants Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are the two leading Internet TV streaming service providers.Digital Platform: The Next Battle FieldIn order to derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform, telecom, cable TV and media operators are aggressively penetrating the digital advertising technology market. Inclusions of dynamic ad-insertion, targeted audience advertising and data-driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective.This advertising platform is designed to monetize applications for publishers and developers through the use of data-driven ad targeting. Currently, tech behemoths like Alphabet, Facebook and Twiter are major beneficiaries of digital advertisements.Integration of Telecom-Cable TV-Media: A Survival StrategyRapid technological advancement is systematically redefining the parameters of the telecom, cable TV and media industries. Vertical integration of distribution and content creation will create a unique platform to serve any sort of communications, broadcasting along with a vast area of entertainment industry.Consider the case of AT&T, which recently received court’s approval to acquire Time Warner Inc.  in $85.4 billion deal. AT&T will now have nationwide high-speed mobile and broadband network, online TV streaming services, a large TV broadcasting network, HBO assets and film production network.This is definitely a ploy to take on the challenges of Silicon Valley tech behemoths. AT&T currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Deals Are on the WayThe court’s approval of AT&T-Time Warner deal is likely to open the floodgate of mergers and acquisitions between telecom, cable TV and media companies. Cable giant Comcast has become a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011. The company is likely give bid for major assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report). The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report) has made a bid for Fox.Verizon, which already acquired digital assets of AOL and Yahoo, had earlier expressed its intention to takeover a major media house. Consequently, media giants like CBS, Viacom and Discovery have become lucrative takeover targets.The chart below shows price performance of Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Disney in the last three months.Bottom LineBusiness models and the economics of the telecom, cable TV and media industries are changing. Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads to automated or programmatic ad selling. All these forces are moving toward telecom-cable TV-content convergence.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1443,FOXA,"The Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea are officially underway, but NBC’s extensive coverage kicks off in earnest Thursday night, with the Opening Ceremony extravaganza scheduled for Friday evening. The two-week Olympic run is hugely important to NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), meaning this could be a great moment for investors to tune in.Big Spenders The Olympics, maybe even more so than its prestigious Sunday Night Football coverage, can make or break NBC’s year. Advertisers clamor to cover these prime-time events—though they will be on tape delay this year due to the time difference—and NBC promotes its coverage for months, on top of spending billions of dollars for the broadcast rights.NBC purchased the rights for the five Olympics from 2000 to 2008 for $3.5 billion. Then the television giant outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC & ESPN when it paid $820 million for the 2010 Winter Games and $1.18 billion for the 2012 Summer Olympics.  The company then spent $4.38 billion to land the four Olympics from 2014 to 2020.Sensing how much more valuable live sports and “must-watch TV” will be in the age of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), NBC Universal spent $7.75 billion to land the exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032. In total, NBC has spent or committed over $17 billion dollars on domestic broadcast rights.With all of this said, the spotlight will be on NBC over the next two weeks, which makes it a great time to consider scooping up its parent company Comcast. More FundamentalsNBC secured $1.2 billion in national advertising sales for its converge of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. Overall, NBC’s coverage of the last Olympics generated $1.6 billion in revenues, according to Comcast financial releases. Just today, NBC announced that it secured $900 million in domestic advertising dollars for this year’s games in South Korea, which marks a record for the Winter Games.Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus estimates call for Comcast’s first quarter 2018 revenues to pop 10% and hit $22.55 billion, which will include Pyeongchang-generated sales. On top of that, the cable and internet power is expected to see its quarterly earnings surge 13% year-over-year.Investors should also be excited to note that Comcast has seen complete agreement on its slew of recent upward earnings estimate revisions for the upcoming two quarters. Comcastis also projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 10.60% over the next three to five years, which is rather impressive for a company of its size.Comcast has also matched or topped earnings estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. But shares of Comcast currently rest over 13% below their 52-week high—and this dip can be attributed, in large part, to the recent market-wide sell-off.Comcast is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and also sports a solid overall “B” VGM grade, as well as an Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) of 3.01%—which means that analyst sentiment has been even stronger recently.The Olympics don’t make up a very large portion of Comcast’s overall revenues, but during Olympic years, the company does experience a substantial uptick. Coupled with its strong first-quarter 2018 estimates, now might not be a bad time to think about grabbing Comcast amid this current downturn.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1447,FOXA,"Media behemoth The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) reported positive earnings surprise in first-quarter fiscal 2018. The company however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding quarter. However, the big take away from the quarter under review was a robust top-line performance. Revenues surpassed the consensus mark for the first time in six quarters. Following the results, the company’s shares gained nearly 3% during after-hours trading on Feb 6. Moreover, the stock has increased 4.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 6.7% gain.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 and increased 21.9% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $15,351 million, up 4% year over year and also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,244 million. The company’s solid performances were driven by double-digit growth in Parks and Resorts segment.The company’s total operating income came in at $3,986 million during the quarter, up 1% year over year. This upside was on a sharp increase in operating income at Parks and Resorts, which offset the decline at Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media. Hopes Hinge on New Streaming ServicesDisney plans to launch its own streaming services, one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers. The company had earlier stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) for subscription streaming of the new movies, effective 2019. The company said the streaming services for ESPN will be launched this spring. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will lend an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games, annually. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis and college sports will be live streamed. The company will charge $4.99 per month for the ESPN live streaming services called ESPN Plus.Disney will start its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. Meanwhile, subscribers can view both Disney’s and Pixar’s latest live action and animated movies via the fresh Disney-branded service, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate.In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has completed the acquisition of BAMTech, a video streaming, data analytics and commerce management company, in September.In the past few quarters, Disney’s ESPN has been a hot topic in the media industry and investors are closely monitoring the performance of ESPN. In the reported quarter, advertising revenues declined in the low-single digit. Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN continue to hamper the company’s results. Most media companies are failing to cope with ""cord cutting"" as consumers are unwilling to pay for a large bouquet of channels.ESPN has sealed a number of deals with mostly new, over-the-top platform owners. These contracts have started to yield results and are increasing subscribers’ strength. Moreover, the company has inked a deal with Hulu and another entity and talks are also on with others. The company had earlier stated that mobile apps are going to rule the future of media and ESPN is rightly on track to put this booming trend to advantage with a wide range of apps on offer.        Segment DetailsThe Media Networks segment’s revenues came in at $6,243 million, almost flat year over year. Cable Networks inched up 1% to $4,493 million whereas Broadcasting revenues declined 3% to $1,750 million.The segment’s operating income came in at $1,193 million, down 12% year over year. Cable Networks saw a 1% dip in operating income to $858 million while the Broadcasting segment reported a 25% slump in operating income to $285 million. Drop in operating income at Cable Networks was primarily due to loss at BAMTech as well as a decline at ESPN, which overshadowed growth at Disney Channels and Freeform.At ESPN, increase in affiliate revenues and lower programming cost were offset by dismal advertising revenues. Decrease in advertising revenues were chiefly on decline in average viewership and lower rates. Meanwhile, rise in affiliate revenues was driven by an increase in contractual rate, which mitigated the fall in subscribers. Decline in Broadcasting revenues was due to reduction in advertising revenues and program sales income plus an increase in production cost write-downs.  Parks and Resorts segment once again turned out to be the savior for Disney. The segmental revenues came in at $5,154 million, up 13% from the year-ago period. The segment’s operating income climbed 21% to $1,347 million, backed by growth at the company’s domestic parks and resorts, cruise line and vacation club businesses. Moreover, a sturdy performance of Disneyland Paris contributed to the operating income growth. Increase in operating income at domestic parks was driven by higher guest spending and attendance, overshadowing higher costs.  Rise in guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices, merchandise spending, food and beverage expense and a surge in room rates. Meanwhile, growth at Disneyland Paris was owing to rising attendance as well as higher average ticket prices.The Studio segment generated revenues of $2,504 million, down 1% year over year. Moreover, operating income slipped 2% to $829 million due to dismal performance of home entertainment and TV/SVOD distribution, which overshadowed strong results from theatrical distribution. Increase in theatrical distribution was on the back of blockbuster performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Thor: Ragnarok.We believe that the year ahead will be fruitful for Disney. The studio is all set to continue with its success story beyond Star Wars, Zootopia and Beauty and the Beast as it boasts an impressive line-up of big budget movies. In 2018, the company is expected to release Black Panther, A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Moreover, analysts believe that the deal with Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy may rekindle investors’ hopes.Further, Disney is acquiring majority of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets including its Film and Television studios accompanied by cable and international TV businesses in a transaction worth $52.4 billion. The accord would give the company a hold on Twenty-First Century Fox's film production business like Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Fox 2000 and its storied television units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21.Consumer Products & Interactive Media division saw a 2% decrease in revenues to $1,450 million. Moreover, the unit’s operating income dropped 4% to $617 million due to decline at merchandise licensing business.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) Quote Other Financial DetailsDisney generated free cash flow of $1,256 million during the reported quarter compared with $405 million in the year-ago period.

1448,FOXA,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), which has agreed to sell some of its properties to The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 41 cents, which reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 22.6%. We note that the rate of decline is likely to accelerate from 3.9% witnessed in the preceding quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $7,968 million compared with $7,682 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe company’s Cable Network Programming segment, which impressed investors in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 owing to rising affiliate fees, is likely to witness robust performance in 2018 too. Management expects domestic affiliate fee to increase at least in high single-digit in all the quarters of fiscal 2018. Affiliate fees are a dominant source of revenues for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from affiliate fees is currently pegged at $3,179, up 9.4% year over year. Moreover, advertising revenues are also likely to increase 1.9% to $2,593 from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from Cable Network Programming segment to increase 9.2% to $4,331 million. However, growth in Cable Network Programming is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Television and Film Entertainment segments, which are expected to report revenues of $1,876 million and $2,266 million, down 0.1% and 2.2%, respectively.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In fiscal 2017, it increased 7% to $16,130 million. Expenses at Cable Network Programming segment increased 11% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to rise in global sports programming costs on account of the inaugural broadcasts of Big Ten college football at FS1 and Argentine Football Association matches at Fox Networks Group International (FNG International) as well as contractual rights increases for Major League Baseball at the domestic sports channels and higher CONMEBOL soccer rights at FNG International. We believe that an increase in expenses due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the company’s margins and affect its bottom line in the coming quarters.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Twenty-First Century Fox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Twenty-First Century Fox has an Earnings ESP of -3.05%. Although, the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.99% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1449,FOXA,"Dismal performance by The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Media Network has been a major concern for investors in the recent past. ESPN, which forms part of Media Network, will be once again under investors’ glare, when Disney report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6.For some time now, declining subscriber count and higher programming costs have been a cause of concern for investors. Disney’s primary cash cow, ESPN, has been under immense pressure as the Pay-TV landscape continues to change due to migration of subscribers to online TV. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN.Media Network’s Strategic Efforts Bode WellHowever, after witnessing a decline of 3% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year improvement of 1.8% to $6,346 million, per analysts surveyed by Zacks, driven by gain in revenues at Cable Networks. Meanwhile, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,531 million and $1,813 million, up 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively.Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. However, it will take some time before the segment makes a strong come back. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech.

1450,FOXA,"Strong performances by The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Parks & Resorts in the previous fiscal year, has aided the House of Mouse time and again to avoid the rut. In fact, the onus fell on this segment to offer a smooth ride with the company’s primary cash cow, ESPN, struggling. Now the question lingering in the investors mind is that whether the Parks & Resorts segment can sustain its good run in first-quarter fiscal 2018, when Disney reports on Feb 6.Disney’s Parks & Resorts division, which has done exceptionally well in fiscal 2017, is likely to sustain the momentum in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the segment reported revenue increase of 6% following gains of 12%, 9% and 6% in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment for the first-quarter fiscal 2018 is pegged at $4,866 million, reflecting an increase of 6.8% year over year. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business, consequently increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities.The segment continues to show robust performances both domestically and internationally owing to rise in customer spending, higher ticket prices and attendance. Moreover, the company is on the verge of completing Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, which are likely to open doors by this summer. Further, constructions of Star Wars Lands in Disneyland as well as Walt Disney World are in progress.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteMoreover, the company’s overall top and bottom-lines are expected to increase in the first quarter driven by robust performance of Parks & Resorts and Studio entertainment segments.

1451,FOXA,"Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Avengers: Infinity War recently crossed $2 billion in gross collections globally in its 48th day of release (debut on Apr 27). Only three other movies — Avatar, Titanic and Star Wars: The Force Awakens — have reached this milestone.Avengers: Infinity War has collected $656.1 million by Jun 11, making it the fifth highest-grossing movie domestically. Per Disney, “it holds the record for biggest domestic debut ever with $257.7 million in its opening weekend.”Internationally, the movie has collected $1.346 billion. Notably, Avengers: Infinity War is the third biggest western release ever in China, with $369.7 million in gross collections since releasing in the country.Studio Business, Content Focus to Drive GrowthWe believe that back-to-back success of Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther makes the studio business a key catalyst for Disney. In fact, the success provided a huge boost to the media giant’s strategy of monetizing franchises from acquired studios like Marvel and Lucasflim. The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus  The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus | The Walt Disney Company QuoteDisney’s Studio Entertainment segment contributes almost 15% to the company’s top line. The company has an impressive line up of big budget movies, slated to be released over the next 18 months. The portfolio includes movies involving Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) characters like Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel (2019), and next Avengers (2019) movie.Notably, per Disney, the MCU is “by far the most lucrative box office franchise of all time.” To date, 19 movies of the MCU have together grossed more than $16 billion.Apart from MCU, Disney is also set to release Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 along with Star Wars: Episode IX.The solid content pipeline is also expected to boost Disney’s Consumer Products division as demand for merchandise associated with blockbuster flicks skyrockets, as was the case with Frozen.Disney also plans to add Marvel-related content for its new standalone streaming service that is set to launch in late 2019. The termination of distribution agreement with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) will enable it to offer rich content, exclusively from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm.Improving Attendance Good for Parks & ResortsDisney recently opened the Toy Story Land in Shanghai, which is now expected to boost the company’s brand visibility in China. Toy Story Land in Orlando is also set to open. Further, constructions of Star Wars Land in Disneyland and Walt Disney World are in progress.Addition of popular themes like Star Wars and Toy Story to Parks & Resorts are likely to increase footfall. We believe that these new additions will continue to boost the attendance rate at Parks & Resorts, which will contribute more than 33% of revenues, going forward.ConclusionDisney’s robust slate of movie titles along with significant visitor growth and increased per capita spending in Parks & Resorts are expected to negate weakness in the ESPN segment.However, escalating tension in the planned 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets deal is a headwind for Disney. AT&T recently received approval for Time Warner acquisition, which can now prompt Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) to submit a higher bid for Fox assets.Nonetheless, Comcast can find it difficult to win over Rupert Murdoch, the largest shareholder of Fox, through an all-cash deal, as it will attract significant capital gain tax. This can finally help Disney to clinch the deal.Currently, Disney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In fiscal 2017, the Studio Entertainment garnered revenues of $8,379 million, down 11% year over year as the prior-year results benefited from robust performance of movies released in 2016.However, analysts believe that the segment is likely to be back on track in fiscal 2018 due to impressive line-up of movies. The company’s latest flick, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has performed well at the box office. Moreover, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco were also released during the quarter under review and did solid business at the box office. So far, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco have garnered above $1.3 billion, $850 million and $680 million, respectively. Analysts polled by Zacks expect Studio segment revenues of $2,767 million, up 9.8% year over year.Moreover, the company’s top and bottom-lines are expected to increase in the first quarter driven by robust performance of Parks & Resorts and Studio entertainment segments.

1453,FOXA,"A federal judge has approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85 billion merger with Time Warner , handing the telecom giant a massive victory in what has been the most intense antitrust case in decades.Shares of AT&T sunk in after-hours trading shortly after the news, while Time Warner stock added as much as 4.5%. The judge’s decision will apparently allow AT&T to buy Time Warner without any significant conditions.Analysts have said that such a decision might limit the government’s power to restrict mergers in the future, with many pointing to potential tie-ups between CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), or Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), as deals that could be affected by this precedent.Judge Richard Leon filed the decision, which will ignite AT&T’s content ambitions and put the company in a better position to battle tech-media hybrids like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Government prosecutors attempted to argue that a combination of AT&T’s distribution network—its cellular and wired broadband infrastructure—and Time Warner’s original content—HBO, Warner Bros., and Turner Broadcasting—would create an anticompetitive environment in today’s evolving communications and media sector.Now, AT&T will leverage those new properties to create a new telecom-media behemoth.Initial investor reaction likely reflects hesitation toward the costs associated with the deal, but it is hard to think that the merger does not present exciting potential for AT&T.Want more market analysis from this author?

1454,FOXA,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) closed at a new all-time high once again on Thursday, as investors continue to gush over the streaming giant’s massive user growth. However, looming in the background lies a soon-to-be streaming juggernaut.Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) well-documented acquisition of key Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets will allow Disney to combine its own movies and original content with that of Fox’s television and film studios. This will give Disney the ability to offer customers a more beefed up version of its own over-the-top streaming service, which is tentatively set to launch in 2019.But Netflix isn’t worried about the entry of a powerful new competitor, which will also take with it nearly all of Disney’s and Fox’s content down the road. “We don't see it as a threat to us any more than Hulu has been,” Netflix’s often-candid Founder and CEO Reed Hastings said in its recent earnings interview (also read: What Reed Hastings Credits for Netflix's Historic Growth).In fact, Netflix has been preparing for such eventualities for years. The company knew that streaming was the future long before most, and therefore, Netflix executives understood that when it really caught fire, networks and entertainment companies would be less willing to license their content.Netflix has been bolstering its original programming division to prepare for the age of subscription-based entertainment. When asked to speculate about the likes of other entertainment giants starting up their own streaming services, Netflix executives were still unshaken.“I would say the big bet they have to make to us, can they make more money licensing their content to us or somebody else than they—by having their own services and managing their own services? That remains to be seen,” Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said.Hastings even went as far as to say he would happily sign up for Disney’s streaming platform when it makes its debut.The company also reassured fans of the popular Netflix Marvel TV shows that they have nothing to worry about, for now. Netflix has leased the rights to those products and “get to use them for a very long time.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1455,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), with 32 nations set to compete in a 64-match tournament over the next month. Billions of people from over 200 countries are expected to watch, which means, for many, the stars are likely the main attraction. And there are few more well-known and revered athletes—or people—in the world than Lionel Messi. This means the Argentinian superstar makes a lot of money off the field, so let’s take a look at how to invest in one of soccer’s biggest stars.The World Cup is a big-budget marketing dream, attracting the likes of Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and many more to spend millions of dollars to promote and attach their brands to FIFA. Meanwhile, Messi himself is linked to one of the World Cup’s biggest partners and other powerhouse companies.Sponsors Messi made his debut for FC Barcelona—one of the richest and most famous clubs in the world—in 2004. The 5-foot-7 inch soccer giant made his first appearance for Argentina in 2005 and played in his first World Cup the following year in Germany. Since then, he has transformed into one of the best soccer players ever and a major brand ambassador. The German sportswear powerhouse Adidas signed Messi to a contract in 2006. Today, he is one of the faces of the brand and signed a “lifetime” deal with Adidas last year—similar to Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) deal with LeBron James. Messi’s Adidas deal helps contribute to the $27 million in sponsorship money he made over the last year. These off-the-field earnings lifted Messi’s overall earnings to $111 million—boosted by his massive new Barcelona contract—landing him second on Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes.Messi is an Adidas man, but he also generates millions of dollars for rival Nike because Barcelona is sponsored by the Oregon-based company. In fact, Messi reportedly generated $111 million in value for Nike over the past 12 months through social media—with rival and Nike star Cristiano Ronaldo doing the same thing for Adidas since his club side, Real Madrid, is sponsored by Adidas. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 30, 2018 at 12:02pm PDTCleary, investors will note just how impactful one of Messi’s sponsored Adidas posts can be on Instagram, where he boasts 93 million followers—among the most on the platform. He also has over 88 million Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) followers, and his own dedicated YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) page—he notably does not have a Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account.His social media reach helped him land the number three spot on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list, behind only Ronaldo and James. This is also part of the reason why he is a valuable partner to a slew of other companies aside from Adidas.The 30-year-old is also a pitchman for Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), through Gatorade, Lays, and Pepsi, as well as wireless company Ooredoo, and many more. So now let’s take a look to see how the companies Messi is directly involved with have performed since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where Messi and Argentina lost in the final to Germany. Clearly, Adidas stock has surged over the last four years. Meanwhile, Mastercard stock is up big since the last World Cup, while Pepsi has trailed the S&P 500, as consumers’ eating and drinking habits rapidly shift.Messi is one of a few players who is able to have an outsized impact on his team and his brand partners.In Russia, Argentina is once again one of the favorites to win the World Cup. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates and to see what impact Messi might have on Fox’s and Telemundo’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1456,FOXA,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged over 5.5% on Tuesday to hit a new 52-week high of $43.99 after J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts raised their price target for the social media company, citing Twitter’s advertising growth as a major reason for their more upbeat outlook.J.P. Morgan analysts upped Twitter’s price target from $39 per share to $50 per share, which marks a 21% premium over Monday's closing price. ""We are raising our estimates on TWTR shares as we believe advertising momentum is strengthening, particularly among large marketers,"" analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Industry conversations suggest the value for advertisers on TWTR is increasing, driven by double-digit DAU [daily average users] growth (6 straight qtrs), improving product for both users & marketers.""The analyst also reiterated his ""Overweight"" rating for Twitter stock. Anmuth noted that the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup will likely boost the company’s ad sales because of Twitter’s real-time highlights video partnership with Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report)—which is broadcasting the world’s biggest sporting event for the first time (also read: From TV Deals to VR, Here's Everything Investors Need to Know About the FIFA World Cup).""We believe Twitter is uniquely positioned as the real-time broadcast and communications network, making it complementary to all other forms of media, including TV. Twitter is also well positioned to benefit from the large shift in dollars toward mobile and native,"" Anmuth stated. ""We believe Twitter has multiple growth drivers ahead, and we believe the company is well positioned to grow its ad revenue next year as the product continues to improve.""Why It Matters J.P. Morgan analysts upped their price target almost completely on the back of Twitter’s advertising growth picture, and noted one specific partnership for a month-long event as an example. For some, this might seem a little one-track-minded.But the World Cup is simply a microcosm of Twitter’s overall standing as a complement to live entertainment and a vital tool for up to the second information. And advertising is how the company makes most of its money.Twitter’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands it live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Twitter’s push is part of a larger effort by social media companies, such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), to offer more live video content.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 70% to reach $0.75 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for fiscal 2018.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1457,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup at Russia will take full charge ofsports lovers all over the world till Jul 15. For the coming one month, sponsors of the event will put up hoardings and adopt every means of advertisement to promote their brands. According to marketing agency Zenith, the event will likely inject about $2.4 billion to the global advertising market.Not only the official partners of FIFA, companies that are into tourism and entertainment will also be in focus due to this event as athletes, event organizers and most importantly spectators from all over the world will gather in the hosting country Russia.In short, the event is a golden goose and will likely have a substantial impact on several companies and stocks. In this regard, below we highlight a few winning bets.Broadcasting Broadcasting appears to be the most important money-spinner in such events. The majority of FIFA’s revenues originate from the sale of television broadcasting rights. The organization has forecast revenues of $5.65 billion in the four years up to the Russia tournament, which if realized would mark a 5% rise on the earlier World Cup cycle.In the United States,Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will air the matches in South America. In some South American countries, DirecTV, owned by AT&T (T  -  Free Report) will broadcast the event.Social Media Social media is mightier than TV broadcasting these days when it comes to a match. Fans also follow players on Instagram (owned by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).Takeaway Restaurants While fans are likely to avoid fine dining restaurants in this one month, they will surely not say no to refreshments. So, takeaway firms are sure to score higher as fans won’t want to lose a moment of the match. Pizza joints like Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) should benefit from higher takeaway sales.BeerBeer consumption normally increases during the World Cup period. Morgan Stanley analysts pointed to a historical trend and concluded that volumes of beer normally see a 2-3% rise in host countries during a World Cup year.Carlsberg (CABGY  -  Free Report), the market leader in Russia and Budweiser maker ABInBev (BUD  -  Free Report), a global sponsor, can be winners thanks to this trend, as quoted on Reuters. ABInBev forecast that its sales in soccer hubs Brazil and Argentina will likely increase by 0.5 to 1 percentage points. The credit can be given to the football-mania as both Heineken and ABInBev topped their counterparts during the last World Cup in 2014.PubsMany will hit the pubs to enjoy the game with a like-minded crowd. Many analysts are of the view that Britain’s pub operators including Greene King Plc GKNGY is likely to be a winner. Morgan Stanley noticed that the pub chain’s sales increased 3.5% during Euro 2016.CasinosBetting at casinos on which team to win the match or finally pick the trophy should be rife now. Also, the Supreme Court's decision to potentially permit legal sports betting in several U.S. states gave a boost to the space.So, casino-hotel companies like MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) should be watched closely. The U.K.-based Paddy Power Betfair Plc PDYPY, which operates as an online betting and gaming company, can also get a short-term boost, if England performs well, per Reuters.Sportswear Brands Arrangements of such a sporting extravaganza definitely put the spotlight on sportswear makers Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). German behemoth Adidas has been a FIFA partner while both Adidas and Nike have famous football players for promoting their brands. The companies are outfitting football teams in the tournament. While both are set to gain from this event, Adidas holds an edge over Nike as the former has managed to bag more teams (12 vs 10) to outfit.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1458,FOXA,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) focus on increasing original content production, localization, subscriber growth, rise in TV rights fees and strategic initiatives bode well for the stock. Further, these factors have helped the stock to register a solid gain of 54.1% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38.3%. Stocks such as News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have also witnessed upsides of 26.4%, 39.7% and 20.1%, respectively. Let’s delve deeper.Driving FactorsWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership.In the long haul, the company will continue banking on WWE’s content distribution agreement. Recently, the company stated that distribution agreement, which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues, will expire in 2019 in some regions. Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30, 2019, while in UK and India it will expire on Dec 31, 2019. The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first-half 2019.Further, in an effort to augment revenues this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. For 2018, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $115 million.HurdlesWWE which distributes home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) as well as digital formats has been witnessing decline in revenues. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first, second and third quarters of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%, 3.2% and 8%, respectively. The decline in home entertainment revenues can primarily be attributed to steady shift by consumers to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1459,FOXA,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) popped 1.29% to close at $191.54 per share on Monday after the company announced its new “Memories” page. But there is a little bit more to the story.MemoriesFacebook launched its new Memories pages that allows users to look back over photos and posts from the past. The content and the idea aren’t new to Facebook. In fact, this is more of an aggregation of the social media company’s current “On This Day” feature.As a whole, Facebook’s new Memories section can include: On This Day, Friends Made On This Day, Recaps of Memories—which will feature seasonal or monthly recaps of memories rolled into a message or short video, and Memories You May Have Missed.Facebook noted that more than 90 million people use On This Day every day. “Research suggests this kind of reflection can have a positive impact on people’s mood and overall well-being,” Facebook wrote in a statement. “This is why we’re updating the experience to ensure all of your memories are easy to find.”Facebook’s latest feature comes as part of a larger initiative to get back to its roots of friends and family-based posts, and away from its more clickbait-heavy newsfeed. The company’s data breach scandal and fake news problem prompted Facebook to make this transition in order to get back into the good graces of it 2.20 billion monthly active users.The company is also reportedly in talks with media companies, including Fox News (FOXA  -  Free Report) and CNN , for news related programming.Everything Else Some investors might not think that Memories is enough to push Facebook stock up over 1%. For their sake, let’s quickly look at why Facebook stock looks pretty appealing right now.Shares of Facebook are up 67% over the last two years, which, maybe surprisingly, comes in well below fellow tech giant Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 136% surge. Still, over the last year, investors can see that Facebook stock is up nearly 30%, despite its major early 2018 sell-off. Facebook stock also currently presents solid value. Coming into Monday, Facebook stock was trading at 22.4X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which does mark a premium to the S&P 500’s 17.1X.Yet, Facebook stock has traded as high as 31.5X and as low as 19.9X over the last year, with a one-year median of 27.5X. Therefore, it is hardly a stretch to say that Facebook’s valuation looks relatively attractive at the moment.Lastly, Facebook’s full-year revenues are projected to soar by 40.6% to touch $57.14 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are expected to climb by 24.5% to hit $7.67 per share.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1460,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The month-long tournament is expected to attract billions of viewers from over 200 countries, making it a marketing dream. The likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) will all be heavily featured, but Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) are the only companies competing against each other. So let’s take a look to see which sportswear company seems poised to come out on top at the 2018 World Cup.According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor. German giant Adidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970. The company also signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030.Therefore, right off the bat, Adidas might get more overall shine with their classic “three stripes” logo plastered on in-stadium signage, official game balls, and more. But this is just the start.JerseysNike has spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse around the world since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. The Oregon-based company has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world, including Europe’s top five leagues. Adidas, which has been a soccer giant for decades, has cultivated and maintained similar relationships and sponsorship deals.Adidas sponsors 12 of the 32 national teams competing at this year’s World Cup. This list includes some of the favorites: Germany, Spain, and Argentina.Nike, in a move that reshaped soccer sponsorships, spent millions of dollar in 1996 to outfit the Brazilian national team. Brazil, who has won the most ever World Cups, with five, is also the top favorite this year. Overall, Nike’s Swoosh logo will appear on 10 different jerseys, including France.Although it is nearly neck and neck, the slight edge has to go to Adidas. (Side Note: Puma sponsors four teams, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list)Stars Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Lionel Messi (Argentina), and Neymar (Brazil) are three of the most famous people on the planet. The three soccer stars ranked number one, three, and four, respectively, on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list. They also all landed in the top five of Forbes’ highest paid athletes rankings. Ronaldo boasts over 202 million followers on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) combined, with the other two resting closely behind.Ronaldo has been with Nike since 2003, while Messi signed with Adidas in 2006—both players are currently on “lifetime” deals with their sportswear companies. Neymar tips the balance slightly in Nike’s favor, with the Brazilian superstar currently under a massive, incentive-laden contract with the American company.Cleats/BootsWith the team sponsorships and some of the biggest stars covered, let’s take a look at what a majority of the players will be wearing on their feet. ESPN ranked their top 50 players at the World Cup and also recently highlighted what boots they will wear when they take the field. The publication noted that 49 of their 50 best players in Russia will sport Nike, Adidas, or Puma—with New Balance as the one outlier.Nike takes the top spot here, with 26 of the 50 set to play in Nike cleats, while Adidas claims 20. However, Adidas noted that 60% of all the players will be wearing Adidas footwear at the World Cup. With that said, the slight edge still has to go to Nike.Stock Performance With the fight between Nike and Adidas still a little too close to call, let’s dive into their stock price performance to help determine a winner.Clearly, Adidas stock has crushed Nike since the end of the 2014 World Cup. Therefore, coupled with its slight edge in the jersey department, and its standing as an official FIFA partner, Adidas appears to be the winner in the 2018 sportswear World Cup.But, this could change depending on how individual players and teams perform on the world’s biggest stage. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1461,FOXA,"Investors in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the January 19, 2018 $29 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Twenty-First Century Fox shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Twenty-First Century Fox is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Film and Television Production and Distribution industry that ranks in the Bottom 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has dropped its estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 48 cents per share to 47 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Twenty-First Century Fox right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

However, none of these games will feature the U.S., who failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986, possibly hurting Fox’s coverage.Meanwhile, fans will be able to create their own highlight packages dating back to 1958, through a Fox platform, powered by IBM’s (IBM  -  Free Report) Watson AI technology. The BBC is set to broadcast all their matches live in virtual reality as well as in 4K Ultra HD.With that said, some of the most well-known companies in the world also spend upwards of $50 million a year to sponsor FIFA and the World Cup. This list includes the likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Qatar Airways, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), and many more.Aside from Fox and some of the major World Cup sponsors, sportswear giants Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) will take center stage in Russia. The two companies lead the way in jersey sponsorships, while German sportswear maker Puma and New Balance will also see their logos plastered all over the world for the next month—notably left off this list is Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report). The 2018 World Cup also features some of the biggest stars in the world including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar.

1463,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup kicks off this week in Russia. As 32 teams fight it out for the coveted trophy over a period of one month, FIFA will be banking on its sponsors for the much-needed stimulus after a poor financial showing for two consecutive years.Goes without saying, FIFA World Cup will turn out to be biggest playground for both FIFA and the tournament’s sponsors for helping each other make the most of opportunity. And it’s not only the event’s sponsors but also a number of others brands that are set to gain from this global extravaganza.Sponsors Ready for the Flag Off The warmup to the finals is already underway with every sponsor designing ads around the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Barring a few, FIFA has managed to rope in most of its long-time partners for this year’s tournament. The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report), VISA Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) continue to be FIFA’s loyal sponsors.In 2016, FIFA incurred a loss of $368 million, followed by a loss of $192 million in 2017. This does not however take anything away from the spectacle and FIFA is hugely anticipating profits this year. According to marketing agency, Zenith, this edition of the world cup will add $2.4 billion to the global advertisement market.Expectedly, sponsors are not hesitating to shell out generously on making their brands visible over the next 30 days. Coca-Cola has spent more than two years in designing its Being Ready campaign. Visa is banking on the popularity of Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic to promote its contactless payment cards. Visa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Beer favorite Budwiser will be unveiling its biggest and most-expensive campaign ever during this year’s tournament. Adidas too has roped in a start-studded cast comprising sporting heroes, musicians and a host of pop icons for its Crete the Answer campaign.Sponsors to Gain From Brand VisibilitySponsors will be focusing on brand visibility with the aim of reaching out to more buyers. Given that world cup football is a summer affair, Coca-Cola will try to cash in on this opportunity. Adidas too has its hopes high, being the jersey and kit sponsor of 12 of the participating teams. Budwiser and McDonald’s are typically the food and beverage associated with any sporting event.According to Morgan Stanley, beer sales volume get a 2-3% boost in host countries. Moreover, Anheuser-Busch recently said that it expects annual sales volumes to increase between 0.5-1% in the finalists Brazil and Argentina.Similarly, Adidas, which introduces new balls every year, will be flaunting its latest brand Telstar 18 this time. Visa, on the other hand, will be stressing more on enhancing the overall football-watching experience. Visa account holders will be getting benefits of exclusive access to tickets via Visa-sponsored pre-sale events.From the Galleries    It’s not only that the FIFA World Cup sponsors stand to gain from the tournament. Those on the side bench too will get a chance to make their presence felt on the field. Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is the kit and jersey sponsor of 10 of the 32 participating countries including big names like Brazil, France and England. This will certainly give the company enough brand visibility.Carlsberg A/S (CABGY  -  Free Report) is the market leader in beers in Russia and will try to take this opportunity to score high this time. Another big winner will be the broadcasters. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will be airing the matches in South America.Besides, streaming media players too will play an important role in this year’s world cup. Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Fire TV and Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Apple TV 4K are expected to attract a large number of viewers this year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1464,FOXA,"The strong relationship between World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) and Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad (Astro) is set to continue in to the 17th year with both companies extending the partnership. Per the new deal, Astro will continue to air WWE programming like Raw and SmackDown.Astro Vice President of Sports Business, Lee Choong Khay, said “The response from the passionate fanbase has been tremendous, with nearly five million viewers in 2017 alone and we hope to serve more fans in years to come.”We believe extension of the agreement between both the companies will enable WWE to increase subscriber base. At the end of third-quarter 2017, the number of average paid subscribers increased 4% year over year in the quarter to 1.52 million. The company had earlier stated that it launched WWE Network in China with its PPTV partners. Further, WWE Network is already available in the Indian Subcontinent, Germany, Austria, Mexico, Switzerland and Japan.Other Strategic InitiativesWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership.In the long haul, the company will continue banking on WWE’s content distribution agreement. Recently, the company stated that distribution agreement, which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues, will expire in 2019 in some regions. Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30, 2019, while in the UK and India it will expire on Dec 31, 2019. The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first-half 2019.Further, in an effort to augment revenues WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. Revenues from international sponsorship increased 29% in the first nine months of 2017 due to joining of blue-chip advertisers such as KFC, Nestlé, AT&T and other gaming partners.Stock PerformanceWorld Wrestling Entertainment’s focus on increasing original content production, localization, subscriber growth, rise in TV rights fees and strategic initiatives have helped the stock to outperform the industry in a year. The stock has surged 70%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 22.3%.Stocks such as News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report)) ,which belong to the same industry, have also witnessed upsides of 42.4%, 14.4% and 20.9%, respectively.WWE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1465,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, Zacks producer and avid golfer Daniel MacPherson joins the show to discuss the current state of golf and the big business surrounding the PGA Tour as the 2018 season swings into full gear.The golf world is abuzz with the possibility of a 2018 PGA Tour season that could see the long-awaited return to success for Tiger Woods, as his presence alone often substantially boosts television ratings and overall interest in the sport. With millions of dollars invested in television coverage, the likes of NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) are all actively rooting for Woods—who missed a majority of the last few seasons due to injuries—to remain healthy.Still, no matter if Woods makes a real comeback or not, the PGA Tour is still a big draw for sponsors as the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), FedEx FDX, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Dell Technologies (DVMT  -  Free Report) and many other major companies are all heavily involved in golf through sponsorships and more.On top of that, despite Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) exiting the golf equipment business and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) selling TaylorMade, the two sportswear powers are still major players in golf apparel even as struggling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) grows its golf segment. What’s more, other golf-focused companies including Titleist and Footjoy owner Acushnet Holdings (GOLF  -  Free Report) and Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) have done well.Lastly, despite gloomy attitudes about golf’s future, the game and business of golf are far from doomed, as amateur interest continues to be spurred by the rise of fun and recreational golf outlets such as Topgolf.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1466,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which shattered records at domestic box office had disappointing opening in China. In the opening weekend, the company managed to collect only $28.7 million, which came in below its last two Star Wars movies. Notably, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story have recorded $52.3 million and $30 million in ticket sales, respectively, in China in the opening weekend.However, the worldwide collection of Star Wars: The Last Jedi has crossed $1 billion mark.  The movie which recorded the second largest opening ever has already become the eighth highest grossing movie domestically.Per the latest report, the company has not only garnered more than $570 million domestically but has also surpassed the Beauty and the Beast domestic collection of $504 million to become the highest grossing movie of 2017.During, the opening weekend the movie raked in $450 million globally. This is the second movie under the Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars trilogy, the first one being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In fact, this eighth episode of Star Wars has set expectations soaring for the final part of the trilogy — Star Wars: Episode IX — scheduled for release in December 2019.All’s Well That Ends WellDisney’s Studio segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016, has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been dull for the movie industry. However, the company’s latest flick has provided a superb ending to 2017, which is a huge boost as we move into 2018. Moreover, analysts believe that the deal with Rian Johnson, the director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy may rekindle investors’ hopes. Further, we believe that the coming two years will be most productive for Disney.This year, the company is expected to release Black Panther, A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp.In addition, the recent deal between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is likely to enhance the company’s Studio Entertainment segment and overall performance. Per the deal, Disney will acquire majority of Twenty-First Century’s assets worth $52.4 billion that include its Film and Television studios along with cable and international TV businesses. The total transaction amount is nearly $66.1 billion that comprises $13.7 billion of Twenty-First Century Fox’s net debt.In the past three months, Disney’s shares have gained 13%, outperforming the industry's growth of 4.3%.

1467,FOXA,"There is no doubt that 2017 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in the history of U.S. stock trading. The market touched more than 60 daily all-time highs, and the S&P 500 closed higher in every single month for the first time in history. That hot streaked has continued into the first days of the New Year, with our major indexes once again surging to new peaks in 2018.Another trend we have also seen move into 2018 is speculation over major mergers and acquisitions. Total M&A activity was actually relatively quiet in 2017—deals were down about 35% through mid-November—but several Wall Street titans either announced major deals or found themselves at the center of deal-related rumors throughout the year.From industry-shifting moves like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods and CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) tie-up with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), to future-focused acquisitions like Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) purchase of CAR-T researcher Kite Pharma and Intel’s INTC deal to buy computer vision firm Mobileye, 2017 had plenty of huge M&A headlines to soak in (also read: 15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017).And so far in 2018, the headlines have continued. The entertainment industry is still reacting to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, and giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have already caused the rumor mill to swirl.With this in mind, let’s take a look a three huge M&A deals that might happen this year:1.       Apple (Finally) Buying NetflixPeople have been arguing that Apple should use its massive cash pile to make a major media acquisition for years now, and video streaming giant Netflix is typically the first choice among speculators.But Apple has defied these speculators time and time again, opting instead to invest in itself. Indeed, the company recently promised $1 billion to its Apple Music division for the purposes of building out original video content, and its first in-house produced shows are starting to debut now.However, the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, could be the catalyst needed to inspire a major Apple deal.Earlier this week, shares of Netflix surged after a note on this very topic from Citigroup analysts emerged. The firm’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that Apple is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company. The analysts suggested that there is as high as a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix soon.But is Apple even interested in the company, or will its attention turn elsewhere? 2.       Amazon Targets… Target?As if Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods was not enough to satisfy the retail deal rumors, the latest batch of industry whispers point to the e-commerce king going after big-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report).The rumors were sparked by Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster, who recently published a report highlighting eight predictions for the technology industry this year.“Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,” Munster argued. “Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.”Amazon burned a lot of its cash with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, but if the financials work out, Target certainly makes sense within the context of the online retailer’s ongoing war with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, another brick-and-mortar acquisition could be a lofty move for the e-commerce company, especially considering how fresh the Whole Foods deal is. Can the internet giant really adapt to traditional retail that quickly? 3.       Time Warner and Comcast Snatch HuluAs mentioned, the entertainment industry is still figuring out what to do next after Disney decided to shell out more than $50 billion in stock for many of Fox’s most important assets. Disney has certainly beefed up the library for its upcoming streaming services, and ESPN’s grasp on the sports world is even tighter with the acquisition of Fox Sports Regional Networks.But one thing that remains unclear is the fate of Hulu, a budding video streaming platform co-owned by Fox, Disney, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner . Disney bought Fox’s 30% stake in the brand, giving it a controlling 60% stake, but it is unlikely that Comcast and Time Warner will give up on the promising streaming platform just yet.Comcast still owns 30% of Hulu, and through its NBCUniversal subsidiary, it could certainly whip up a Hulu-NBC-Universal streaming service that could compete with Disney and Netflix. Teaming up with Time Warner and its HBO division could add even more firing power.Of course, we have yet to see any indication that Disney is looking to shed its new controlling stake in Hulu, but one would imagine that it could become a bargaining tool in what is sure to be a complicated regulatory approval process.With Netflix, Disney, and Amazon poised to be video streaming leaders in five years’ time, might Comcast and Time Warner look to toss a fourth hat into the ring? Want more stock market analysis from this author?

However, National Association of Theater Owners is yet to provide any confirmed data on this front.Per media reports, Disney garnered $2.4 billion from the ticket sales in North America, which is more than 21% of the total domestic market share. Blockbuster performance of Disney’s latest flick Star Wars: The Last Jedi, along with runaway hits like Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 were the primary reasons for the studio’s success in 2017.

1469,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Star Wars: The Last Jedi is flying high at the box office, with its worldwide collection crossing the $1 billion mark. The movie which recorded the second largest opening ever has already become the eighth highest grossing movie domestically. Further, the film is likely to overtake the seventh placed movie Star Wars: Rogue One in the coming days.Per the latest report, the company has not only garnered $517.1 million domestically but has also surpassed the Beauty and the Beast domestic collection of $504 million to become the highest grossing movie of 2017.During, the opening weekend the movie raked in $450 million globally. This is the second movie under the Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars trilogy, the first one being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In fact, this eighth episode of Star Wars has set expectations soaring for the final part of the trilogy — Star Wars: Episode IX — scheduled for release in December 2019.After the phenomenal opening weekend, second and third-weekend success, speculations are rife whether the movie can surpass the Fate of the Furious and Beauty and the Beast collections of $1.23 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively to become the highest grossing movie of 2017 globally. We believe that given the kind of success the movie has already tasted, it would hardly be a surprise if it overtakes both the aforementioned films.All’s Well That Ends WellDisney’s Studio segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016, has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been dull for the movie industry. However, the company’s latest flick has provided a superb ending to 2017, which is a huge boost as we move into 2018.

1470,FOXA,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp’s portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone TeamThis fall, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC’s mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC’s team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1471,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) $52.4 billion deal to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) movie and television assets might have just opened up new avenues for it in India — one of the world’s fastest growing economies. With regional language television content, cricket and soccer rights, and content for digital and mobile entertainment platform, it goes without saying that Disney has opportunities galore in India that ought to multiply its revenues in the near future.The recent deal will see Disney acquire the Twentieth Century Fox television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets. Although a few lucrative assets such as Fox News and Fox Broadcasting have been left off, Disney with this multi-billion deal has laid its hands on Star India, Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report) and Fox’s attractive bouquet of 22 regional sports networks, a big deal indeed that paves the way for the company to emerge as a global sports giant.That said, Disney is poised to benefit from the India market with the acquisition of Star India that boasts a bouquet of 69 regional channels in eight languages.Taking the India Route to SuccessFox’s extensive India arm, Star India Pvt. Ltd, is a market leader in that country holding almost 20% share. Getting hold of Star India might now prove to be a game-changing move by Disney, helping it generate huge advertisement revenues from all corners.Disney has a market cap of $164 billion, while 21st Century Fox is worth $62 billion, with Star India alone estimated to be worth something between $14 billion and $16 billion. That makes Star India’s valuation around 25-30% of the entire acquisition deal.Interestingly, it’s not just the television channels that Disney is banking on. The deals lugs along Hotstar, India’s most popular digital and mobile entertainment platform, and the five-year broadcasting rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL) — one of the biggest money churners for that country’s media industry. It can thus be said that Disney will bank on three categories to increase its revenues in India — subscription TV market, online and digital entertainment platform and sports broadcasting.Walt Disney Company (The) Price and Consensus  Walt Disney Company (The) Price and Consensus | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteSubscription TV MarketIndia has the second-largest subscription television market in Asia with more than 154 million households in 2016. And going by a PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the market is set to touch 167 million by 2021. Star India’s 69 channels, of which 10 are sports channels, gives Disney immense opportunity to multiply its revenues from advertisement.Moreover, there is growing demand for regional language content that promises advertisers from all corners of the country. Interestingly, U.S. ad spending is growing at a slow pace. However, the scene is completely different in India.Fox’s U.S. advertisement revenues increased a meager 3% in fiscal first quarter, while its international advertisement revenues grew 10%. This growth can be attributed to double-digit growth through Star India. Disney will definitely grab this opportunity.Online & Digital EntertainmentAlthough India was a slow starter, the mobile video traffic market is fast growing, thanks to low subscription fees. With Hotstar in its kitty, Disney surely will get an edge over new entrants like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Although Netflix’s India market is steadily growing, Hotstar has already struck a chord with the audience because of its regional and local content and sports rights. Bollywood, the local film industry, and Cricket are worshipped in India, and Hotstar offers both, thus scoring on the popularity quotient..Sports Broadcasting RightsAs mentioned, cricket generates a huge chunk of advertisement revenues for the media industry in India and Hotstar along with Star India’s 10 sports channels can emerge as a cash cow for Disney. A major portion of the revenues is expected to come from cricket, as Star India shelled out $2.55 billion earlier this year to acquire the broadcast and streaming rights of the IPL for five years, beating the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report). Given that Disney’s largest sports network ESPN has been losing customers in the United States, as more subscribers are opting for digital viewing, the dual broadcast and streaming rights of IPL might bring back the company’s fortunes.However, Disney has been witnessing downward revisions in earnings estimates lately. As a result, it currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1472,FOXA,"Investors in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 22, 2017 $25.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Twenty-First Century Fox shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Twenty-First Century Fox is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Film and Television Production and Distribution industry that ranks in the Top 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 53 cents per share to 47 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Twenty-First Century Fox right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Also, with billions of dollars invested for years to come, the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report) hope the NFL’s ratings recover.But the rise of the NBA, Major League Soccer, and esports could provide new outlets for more massive rights deals.Still, even if the NFL’s ratings don’t return to their all-time highs, sports rights could become even more important and valuable as advertisers look to secure deals with content partners where “live” is vital.Finally, Breit, a former Big 4 accounting firm partner who has worked on major professional sports franchise acquisitions, dives into how retail investors can invest in sports. If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1474,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining ground with its latest release Star Wars: The Last Jedi raking in $450 million in the opening weekend. This is the second flick under the Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars trilogy, the first one being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In fact, this eighth episode of Star Wars has set expectations soaring for the final part of the trilogy — Star Wars: Episode IX in the Star Wars saga — scheduled for release in December 2019.The latest movie has got off to a great start in the domestic market, with the film earning $220 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. Also, this is the second largest opening weekend after the Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015.In fact, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is flying high at the box office with its overseas collection of $230 million in the opening weekend, almost at par with the analysts’ expectations. This new movie is the fifth largest debut ever, excluding the Chinese market — the world’s second largest movie market. Here, the movie is to release on Jan 5.Moreover, this media behemoth has a solid track record of box-office hits for the last couple of years. In 2015, the company had released Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel's Ant-Man, Inside Out, Cinderella and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Also, 2016 has been a magnificent year for the company’s movie business backed by the release of Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia, which surpassed $1 billion at the box office. Furthermore, Jungle Book was very successful with a worldwide collection of $966 million.However, the company has disappointed its viewers in 2017 as the year has been dull for the movie industry. Nevertheless, we believe Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s success to favor the company’s box office collections and profitability in the coming days.In addition, the recent deal between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is likely to enhance the company’s Studio Entertainment segment and overall performance. Per the deal, Disney will acquire majority of Twenty-First Century’s assets worth $52.4 billion that include its Film and Television studios along with cable and international TV businesses. The total transaction amount is nearly $66.1 billion that comprises $13.7 billion of Twenty-First Century Fox’s net debt.In the past three months, Disney’s shares have gained 13%, outperforming the industry's growth of 3.1%.

1475,FOXA,"It’s a win-win deal for all you Marvel fans out there. After years of speculation and what-if moments, the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool will finally join the rest of the Marvel juggernaut following the media deal of the year, if not the decade. But it is difficult to be similarly enthusiastic about The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) $52.4 billion takeover of key Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets.While Disney does gain many mouthwatering options, it remains to be seen how these assets will help it launch its own streaming offensive in 2019. And was the asset sale, Murdoch’s way of acknowledging that he’s largely quitting the entertainment side of things? The media mogul refused to acknowledge such feelings at a recent news conference saying:  “Are we retreating? Absolutely not.”Has Disney Really Benefited?Probably the biggest media player of them all at present, Disney’s performance on the bourses has lagged far behind its soaring ambition. Since late 2015, the stock assumed a sluggish trajectory and has gained only 4.4% over the last two years, underperforming the broader industry over this period. Disney has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.At the time of this acquisition, Disney is beset by several problems, particularly at ESPN where its subscriber base is shrinking even as it has to bear high programming costs.  Recently, it decided to terminate the distribution agreement with Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming and is on the verge of launching its own streaming services —one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers.Disney does gain several key media assets as it prepares to launch its own streaming service. But is difficult to decipher how the large number of regional sporting networks it owns, reputedly worth nearly a third of the entire deal value,  will help in shoring up its losing TV business. Surely, all these businesses are also facing the prospect of a wave of ensuing cord cutting.Further, the media behemoth now has access to Fox’s massive collection of movies and television programming. But what Disney needs to do at this point is to build a streaming service with a loyal customer base. Recent trends in this segment clearly point to a fragmented scenario where the popularity of niche offerings is rising.Disney may be better off launching a more focused service and only time will tell how it  utilizes its new found assets. The acquisition of a large stake in Hulu, on the other hand, is more of a clear victory.Intensifying Competition Forced Murdoch’s Hand?The view on the Fox end of things is even less clear and the jury is still out on what forced Murdoch’s hand. Essentially, he has offered up to Disney the lion’s share of Fox’s media and entertainment assets. This is an unlikely move for a media baron who was well known for aggressive deal making. For instance, in 2014, Murdoch famously, and presciently, bid for Time Warner Inc. .But his confident posturing notwithstanding, the deal is probably a quiet acknowledgement of not only how much the media business has changed but also of how technology centric it has become. Further, the space has been marked by hectic acquisitions which have created even bigger media behemoths.For instance, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has acquired Huffington Post, AOL and Yahoo. Disney is an even stronger case in point, since it now owns not only Marvel but also Lucasfilm which makes the Star Wars motion pictures.The sale of these Fox assets will allow Murdoch to focus on his beloved newspaper assets which includes the likes of the Wall Street Journal and The Times. This is Murdoch’s first love since he built his business from the lone paper in Adelaide that he inherited from his father.Murdoch has indicated that he may merge New Fox, the entity to be created from surviving Twenty-First Century Fox assets with News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) or News Corp. Murdhoch’s heir apparent and his older son Lachlan has said: “The New Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand.”Personal Equations Also at PlayIndustry watchers have also characterized the deal as a turning point in Murdoch’s relationship with his younger son James, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Apparently, differences between father and son have accumulated over the years, and are now difficult to resolve. Essentially, Murdoch believes his younger son failed to develop his empire’s entertainment assets to their full potential.James Murdoch probably has a future at Disney and the media behemoth’s chairman Bob Iger has hinted at such a prospect. But at this point, their seems to be no clear and immediate winners from a deal which has captured the imagination of investors and industry watchers alike.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsTwenty-First Century Fox reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 49 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and declined 5 cents from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $7.42 billion came ahead of the consensus mark of $7.31 billion but declined 2% from the year-ago quarter. This was due to the absence of Television advertisements for Super Bowl LI, which had largely benefited the company in the prior year quarter. However, increase in affiliate revenues at the Cable Network Programming was a positive.Quarter DetailsSegment wise, Cable Network Programming revenues (59.6% of total revenues) jumped 9.8% to $4.42 billion on the back of robust affiliate, syndication as well as advertising revenue growth.Filmed Entertainment revenues (30.2%) were down 0.6% to $2.24 billion while Television segment net revenues (15.5%) decreased 32% to $1.15 billion, both on a year-over-year basis.On the basis of component, affiliate revenues (47.3%) increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to $3.51 billion. At domestic cable channels, affiliate revenues grew 10% owing to a rise in contractual rate across all domestic brands. Affiliate revenues for international cable channels advanced 14% owing to an increase in rates and subscriber growth at FNG International as well as STAR.Advertising revenues (21.1% of total) declined 26% year over year to $1.642 billion due to the absence of television advertising revenues of Super Bowl, which was broadcast in the year-ago quarter.International advertising revenues for Cable Network Programming declined 1% primarily owing to the shift in timing of cricket matches, which overshadowed the improvement at FNG International.Domestic advertising revenues for cable programming increased 3% year over year primarily due to increase in Fox News pricing. Content revenues (28.9%) increased 3.4% year over year to $2.15 billion.Operating DetailsThe company’s total segment operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) came in at $1.89 billion, down 2.3% year over year. Increase in OBIDA from Cable Network Programming was negated by decline in OIBDA from Television, Film Entertainment and Other, Corporate and Eliminations.As a result, OIBDA margin of 25.5% contracted 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis.OIBDA at Cable Network Programming rose 16.5% to $1.68 billion on higher revenues. The increase was partially offset by 6% rise in expenses due to higher sports and entertainment programming costs. Shift in cricket match timings attributed to lower sports programming costs for STAR India.OIBDA contribution from domestic rose 15% year over year due to increase in contribution from all domestic brands. OIBDA contribution from International cable channels jumped 23% year over year backed by more than double contribution from STAR. However, lower performance at FNG International was a dampener.Filmed Entertainment’s OIBDA slumped 23% to $286 million on account of lower revenues from the television production business. Further, increase in expenses due to the release of FoxNext Games’ mobile game Marvel Strike Force was an overhang.Television segment’s OIBDA plunged 59% to $78 million on account of unfavorable comparison due to Super Bowl. Moreover, decline in broadcast and ratings of National Football League weighed on results.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash & cash equivalents were $7.32 billion compared with $5.81 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion in the quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and Consensus  Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and Consensus | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, FOXA has an average Growth Score of C. Its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise FOXA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

1478,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is less than a week away, with the first game between the host country and Saudi Arabia scheduled to kick off at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 14 on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). Now that World Cup fever has started to truly set in, let’s take a look at how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed.FIFA, which stands for the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, currently offers companies the chance to become official partners, World Cup sponsors, or regional sponsors. It is unclear exactly how much these official FIFA partners pay, but the federation reportedly grabbed $1.58 billion in marketing dollars alone for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.FIFA’s pitch is simple: “The World Cup is the most effective international marketing platform, reaching millions of people in over 200 countries throughout the world.” So, with all that said, let’s take a look at how some of FIFA’s biggest publicly traded marketing and advertising sponsors are doing.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 5.5% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 73% climb. Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down 3.7% as consumers’ drinking habits shift.VisaMoving on, Visa landed a deal with FIFA in 2007 that gave it the rights to become an official sponsor starting in 2010, replacing Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). The credit card giant is now a partner and has signed on through 2022.Unlike Coca-Cola, Visa stock has soared since it became a FIFA sponsor. Clearly, there are many other factors involved, but it is interesting all the same, and also highlights why many question the real value of sports sponsorships.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since the 2014 World Cup. It is also worth noting that the company’s surge outpaces rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) roughly 95% climb. Fox & TelemundoLastly, let’s look at two of the integral parts of the tournament, Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two giants won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Fox reportedly agreed to pay more than $400 million, with Telemundo dropping $600 million. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. It will also certainly be fun to see how Fox’s World Cup coverage performs, especially since the U.S. men’s team didn’t qualify for the first time since 1986.Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1479,FOXA,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) just secured the live rights for a small, but very important number of Premier League soccer games starting in the 2019 season. The move is part of a slow, methodical effort by Amazon to build up its live sports offerings, which has long been the last great hope for linear television. And this should strike at least some amount of fear in TV powers and fellow streaming services such as Hulu and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report).The DealAmazon, which announced the deal just a week before the World Cup, now owns live and “exclusive” rights for 20 Premier League games a season in the UK. The three-year deal will see Amazon Prime live stream the first December midweek round and the festive Bank Holiday round of games. This includes the December 26 or Boxing Day—a national holiday—slate of games that regularly features matchups between a large chunk of the 20-team league. Boxing Day games are highly important in the soccer-obsessed land.The Premier League deal was for an undisclosed amount, but it is hugely important as Sky Sports (SKYAY  -  Free Report) and BT Sport (BT  -  Free Report) have come to dominate Premier League coverage recently. The two cable giants won the rights earlier this year to broadcast nearly all of the remaining Premier League games starting in 2019, reportedly paying a combined $6 billion.UK soccer fans with an Amazon Prime membership will be able to watch all of these games at no extra charge. Amazon’s deal also marks the first time that a full round of Premier League fixtures will be broadcast live in the UK. “Prime Video will be an excellent service on which fans can consume live Premier League football—including for the first time in the UK a full round of matches—and we look forward to working with them from season 2019/20 onwards,” Premier League Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore said in a statement.Why It MattersOn the surface level, the deal will likely encourage tons of people in the UK to sign up for an Amazon Prime subscription during the vitally important holiday shopping period. But let’s go a little deeper.Amazon’s push into one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, for a fun and highly anticipated slate of games, is pretty impressive and will likely frighten streaming and cable companies alike. For the non-soccer fans out there, imagine if a UK-based streaming service bought the exclusive rights to broadcast the NBA’s Christmas Day games, beating out ESPN and TNT  or better still, think about the same situation but with NFL games on Thanksgiving on CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report).The Premier League deal also follows Amazon’s infiltration into NFL programming. The e-commerce behemoth paid $50 million to broadcast 10 Thursday Night Football games this past season, a deal the two sides renewed for the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Amazon’s push into the NFL, which came on the heels of Twitter’s (TWTR  -  Free Report) Thursday Night Football partnership for the 2016 season, has been pretty well publicized.With that said, its long-term impact on the way we consume lives sports has been somewhat understated. Amazon beat out the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and others for its NFL deal. Meanwhile, the company has more quietly built up a strong relationship with the NBA.Amazon now streams the NBA’s growing minor league, known as the G-League, through its widely popular Twitch streaming platform. More recently, the company landed the rights to stream the NBA’s new esports league, which they started in partnership with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Live sports programming is one of the last remaining reasons that many people still cling to their cable subscriptions. But, if five or ten years from now, sports fans can watch live NFL, NBA, and Premier League games, among others on Prime, Amazon could easily become the cord cutters go-to new home.Furthermore, Amazon Prime now boasts an array of original programming and is expected to spend roughly $5 billion on new original programming this year. Amazon committed $250 million on one new Lord of the Rings series. These moves come as it prepares to do battle with Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) over-the-top streaming service that is scheduled to launch in late 2019, as well as Netflix, HBO, and others.Going forward, expect Amazon to continue to bolster its live sports offerings and its original programming to better compete against the likes of Hulu, Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YoutTube TV, Netflix, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and almost anyone else.Live sports, TV shows, and movies, paired with free Amazon shipping, all for Prime’s $12.99 a month or $119 a year price tag, seems like almost too good of a deal. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1480,FOXA,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged over 5% on Tuesday to hit a new 52-week high of $40.16 per share after it was announced that the social media company is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index. This might put some added pressure on Twitter stock, but it still looks like a strong buy at the moment. Here’s why.Twitter stock hit its highest point in almost three years on Tuesday on the back of news that the company is set to be added to the S&P 500 index before trading opens on Thursday. Twitter will replace Monsanto MON now that the company’s Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report) buyout looks more assured. Therefore, Twitter will soon be a part of many passive funds that track the S&P 500 index (also read: A Quick Overview of the Bayer-Monsanto Merger After DOJ Approval).The company’s volume had climbed to nearly 59 million through late afternoon trading, far above its average of roughly 27 million. Twitter ended Monday with a market value of $28.5 billion, which topped more than 60% percent of companies in the S&P 500. The social media firm also joined tech giants Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), which all hit new 52-week highs on Tuesday.Price Movement Now that we have looked at Twitter’s most recent gains and explained the reasoning behind the surge, let’s take a look at more of the social media company’s current fundamentals that make it look like an attractive stock.Before Tuesday’s gains, shares of Twitter had soared over 118% during the last year, crushing the S&P 500’s roughly 13% climb. Twitter’s year-long surge also tops its industry’s 27% gain—this industry includes the likes of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and others.Maybe more impressively, shares of Twitter have skyrocketed 160% over the last two years, which outpaces social media behemoth Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) roughly 63% climb. Investors will also note Twitter’s great year to date performance.Growth InitiativesMoving on, Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year, but every user counts when it comes to growing its top line.The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands its live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports FOXA, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineTwitter has been a great platform to share news instantly for years, but it had struggled to monetize its importance. Now, the company looks ready to profit from its live video push.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1481,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains discusses the business of basketball as the NBA Finals, featuring LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors, heats up. From strong TV ratings during the 2017-18 season to continued social media growth throughout the world, the NBA looks like a league poised to dominate for decades to come.The NBA saw its national television ratings climb during the regular season across the league’s television-network partners, which includes Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, and Turner’s  TNT. Meanwhile, local TV ratings jumped as well on outlets such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Fox Sports FOXA. This all comes in contrast to the NFL’s ratings declines over the last two years.Viewers and investors should also note that the NBA secured its first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals, with Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube TV featured throughout the broadcast in an array of ways. Going forward, the NBA’s close relationships with the likes of Google and other streaming services could play a huge role in its future success.But it’s not just the NBA’s TV partners benefiting from the league’s growth, the likes of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Goodyear GT, and many more have joined in on the fun. And this comes on top of the major investments American Express AXP, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) continue to make.Furthermore, Nike NKE looks poised to benefit from its new NBA partnership that might see it remain in business with the league for a long, long time—especially as the likes of Adidas ADDYY and Under Armour UAA become less relevant in the world of basketball.The NBA is already much bigger than nearly every sports league in the world on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). It has also established a strong relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) through multiple Twitch streaming deals, which includes the rights to the league’s brand new esports league it developed with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Looking ahead, the NBA’s growth in China—through partnerships with Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) and Weibo (WB  -  Free Report)—will be intriguing to follow.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1484,FOXA,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) opened higher on Friday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the social media company is close to announcing its first set of video news shows, from outlets such as Fox News (FOXA  -  Free Report) and CNN . The questions are can Facebook’s news programming be successful, and maybe more importantly, will it boost Facebook’s top line?Facebook is reportedly set to introduce news shows for its Facebook Watch video platform, with the Wall Street Journal saying that a few shows could be announced as soon as next week—and some may launch in July. The embattled social media company, which is trying its best to shake off its fake news problem, hopes to use a mixture of daily, weekly, and even monthly news shows from more legitimate sources—big and small—to drown out much of the false news circulating the platform that has plagued Facebook of late.Mark Zuckerberg’s company is set to finance all of the programming that will appear exclusively on Facebook. The social media powerhouse has reportedly offered publishers between $1 million and $3 million for one-year contracts. Aside from Fox News and CNN, Facebook is negotiating deals with News Corp’s Dow Jones & Co., BuzzFeed, digital-media company ATTN, and others. A Fox News show hosted by Shepard Smith has reportedly already started shooting test footage.There is still a lot of uncertainty floating around and publishers have been “turned off by Facebook’s shifting strategy.” But this video news push is something that Facebook is likely to go forward with, especially as fellow social media power Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) makes a major live video push, which includes news shows.This news push also comes just a day after Facebook held its annual stockholder meeting in Menlo Park, California that turned into a chaotic and confrontational event where a plane flew over Facebook headquarters pulling a banner that read ""YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY."" Yet shares of Facebook climbed 2.2% on Thursday, marking its third straight session of gains, as investors see an opportunity to buy a strong stock at a bit of a discount.""We're going to make sure that we take a broader view of our responsibility,"" Zuckerberg said at the meeting. Facebook might see these shows as a start, but it’s unclear how popular these new news shows will be. But it is not too hard to imagine at least some of this news content performing well, especially considering that Facebook now boasts 1.45 billion daily active users and 2.20 billion monthly active users.Furthermore, as more people ditch cable, these live news offerings could become even more valuable, considering that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and others could easily move in this same direction. And, since advertising accounted for over 98% of Facebook’s $11.97 billion first-quarter revenues, churning out more video content is likely one of the last remaining untapped sources of ad sales.At the end of the day, Facebook investors should pay attention to how these shows are received and how they perform, as they could play a valuable role in a media landscape where streaming giants like Netflix (NFLX) are slowly becoming king.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1485,FOXA,"Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest entertainment companies, but it has seen its stock price fluctuate pretty widely over the last couple of years as investors assess Disney’s place in a quickly changing media landscape. With that said, now might be a great time to buy Disney stock, especially if its 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) deal is completed.Recent NewsFox announced on Wednesday that its shareholders will vote on July 10 about the company’s proposed asset sale to Disney. Meanwhile, Disney called for a similar meeting on that same day to approve issuing equity for its proposed $52.4 billion all-stock purchase of an array of valuable Fox assets, including its film and TV studio, international television rights, cable networks—including highly important regional sports networks—and Fox’s stake in streaming power Hulu.Most Disney investors would likely love to see this deal go through as it would bolster its content offerings at a time when that might be all that matters, especially as it readies the launch of its Disney branded over-the-top streaming service. But, Disney rival Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is also in the running for these same Fox assets.Even if this potential Fox deal doesn’t go through, Disney’s own studio offerings, along with Marvel and Star Wars, its booming parks and resort business, and even the struggling ESPN, give the historic entrainment giant enough firepower to compete against the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and everyone else for years to come.This might sound a little too simple for some investors, but when looking at some of Disney’s other fundamentals, its stock looks rather attractive and also rather cheap.Recent Performance Shares of Disney have climbed 201% over the last 10 years, which outpaces the S&P 500’s 113% climb. However, within the last five years, Disney stock has lagged the index’s nearly 70% surge, up only 55.8%. Still, Disney stock outperformed Fox’s 18% climb and inched by Comcast’s 53.5%—falling just behind Time Warner’s  nearly 60% surge. Investors might be disappointed by Disney’s recent decline. Yet the company’s downturn has Disney stock sitting more than $13 per share or roughly 13% below its 52-week high.

1486,FOXA,"Investors in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 20, 2018 $25.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Twenty-First Century Fox shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Twenty-First Century Fox is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Film and Television Production and Distribution industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 58 cents per share to 53 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Twenty-First Century Fox right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1489,FOXA,"Rumors that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) will acquire most of the film and TV business of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), has finally turned true. The takeover has been signed at $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Under the terms of the deal, Fox stockholders will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each share held. Fox shareholders will be granted a 25% stake in Disney, and Disney CEO Bob Iger will remain in charge through at least 2021. Disney will assume roughly $13.7 billion of 21st Century Fox’s debt, bringing the total value of the planned transaction to $66.1 billion. The transaction, pending regulatory approval, is expected to complete in 12 to 18 months (read: Why Media Stocks & ETFs Are Under Pressure).A Big Boon to Disney?The House of Mouse, which is a home to Lucasfilm (the “Star Wars” movies), Marvel (the “Avengers”) and Pixar (“Toy Story”) as well as the Disney brands, will own Fox’s film production businesses including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000. This would bring the “X-Men”, “Fantastic Four” and “Deadpool” rights back into the Marvel fold and add “Avatar” — the highest grossing movie in history — to Disney’s family of franchises.Additionally, Disney will acquire the Fox film studio with hit TV series including This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider Sky.Given this, the move would bolster Disney's streaming and television content and come as a perquisite to its planned launch of an ESPN streaming service in 2018 and the studio's streaming service in 2019. It would also spur the competitive positive of Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) (read: Netflix at Record High: ETFs to Play).On the other hand, Fox will spin off the Fox Broadcasting network and stations into a newly listed company centered on live news and sports brands. This will include Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcast Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network, as well as the company’s studio lot in Century City and equity investment in Roku.However, the Disney and 21st Century Fox deal will attract the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice, which recently filed an antitrust lawsuit to try and stop the AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  merger.Market ImpactThe blockbuster deal pushed shares of Fox and Disney up 6.5% and 2.7%, respectively, on the day. Since the deal could transform the entire media industry, PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio (PBS  -  Free Report) now has been on investors’ radar.  ETF in FocusPBS is the only pure play fund providing exposure to media stocks under one roof. It seeks to offer capital appreciation by investing in companies that are selected on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value by tracking the Dynamic Media Intellidex Index.

While Disney does not account for any portion in the fund’s basket, it will hop in upon completion of the deal. The addition of DIS would propel PBS higher on the hype surrounding its expansion (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The product has often been overlooked by investors as depicted by AUM of $47.4 million and average daily volume of 42,000 shares. It has gained 7.2% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting some upside potential in the coming months.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1490,FOXA,"Putting an end to all speculation, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) has officially declared a deal. Per the deal, Disney will acquire majority of Twenty-First Century Fox’s assets, which includes its Film and Television studios accompanied by cable and international TV businesses. Following, the announcement shares of Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox gained nearly 3% and 7%, respectively, yesterday.The value of the deal is pegged at $52.4 billion. However, the total transaction amount is nearly $66.1 billion, which includes $13.7 billion of net debt of Twenty-First Century Fox.Disney Opens a New Pandora’s Box of EntertainmentPer the deal, Disney will acquire Twenty-First Century Fox’s film production business like Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures as well as Fox 2000 and its storied television units Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21.The deal will bring Twenty-First Century Fox’s blockbuster properties like the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool under Marvel family. This will help to create more interesting inter-related characters as well as stories for audiences. Further, the inclusion of Avatar to the Disney family will give viewers an opportunity to enjoy storytelling within these amazing fantasy worlds.Orin C. Smith, independent Lead Director of Disney stated “When considering this strategic acquisition, it was important to the Board that Bob remain as Chairman and CEO through 2021 to provide the vision and proven leadership required to successfully complete and integrate such a massive, complex undertaking.”Disney to Rule Sports WorldDisney is treading on the right path in its quest to strengthen arms. The accord would give the House of Mouse a hold on FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Sports Regional Networks (excluding flagship broadcast network, Fox News and the cable sports networks FS1 and FS2), Fox Networks Group International, Star India along with Fox’s stake in Hulu, Sky plc, Tata Sky as well as Endemol Shine Group. Notably, 21st Century Fox remain committed to closing its acquisition deal to buy 61% stake of Sky, which it does not currently. The transaction is expected to conclude by Jun 30, 2018.Following the approval of deal, Disney would have telecasting rights of Major League Baseball and NBA in United States, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League in Europe and also Indian Premier League.Disney’s international footprint will increase substantially by the addition of the aforementioned sports channels. Inclusion of Sky will give Disney 23 million customers in UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy. Moreover, Fox Networks International operates above 350 channels in 170 countries, while Star India has 69 channels serving 720 viewers per month.The deal would also be a bout of fresh air to Disney, which for quite some time now has been jostling in the fast changing media landscape, where rise in streaming and cord cutting have become two faces of the coin. The only possible way out is either you make yourself bigger or get eaten by a bigger fish, or you shrink to focus on core profitable operations.No wonder, the buyout of these assets would considerably enhance the media mogul’s bargaining power with Cable TV providers, increase affiliate fees, provide a fresh lease of life to ESPN and create cost synergies. Further, the addition of Fox's rich library of movies and TV series would greatly enhance Disney’s prospects in the streaming service.Wrapping UpTechnological advancement is playing a major role in how people prefer to watch their favorite programs now days, and with new entertainment products and services available traditional media players are losing competitive leverage. Disney to an extent has been the victim of the same.Nevertheless, the company is taking steps to be more in sync with the contemporary. The acquisition of BAMTech, the video streaming and data analytics company, can be cited as one of the examples in that direction. Further, a deal with Fox would consolidate its position in the movie business as well as sports broadcasting.However, it is to be seen that the deal, which received President Trump’s support, will clear antitrust hurdles or not. Some fear that the deal might face regulatory hurdles, as observed in the case of AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) deal to buy Time Warner . Sarah Sanders, White House spokeswoman stated “I know that the President spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president's favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs and certainly looks forward to and hoping to see a lot more of those.”In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have gained 12.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.8%.

1491,FOXA,"After long marketing buzz, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) has agreed to sell some of its properties to The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) for about $52.4 billion in stock. This will include 21st Century Fox’s Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios, as well as cable and international TV businesses. For the rest, 21st Century Fox made clear that it will spin-off into a newly listed company — “Fox” including its highly-rated news, sports and broadcast businesses, just before the acquisition.The merger has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, while shareholder approval of these companies still remains pending. Further, it is conditioned up on receiving approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, numerous other non-United States merger and other regulatory reviews, as well as customer closing conditions.The New “Fox”The spinoff will include Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network (BTN). Additionally, the company’s studio lot in Los Angeles and equity investment in Roku will also form a part of the new Fox.This new company will focus on live news and sports brands, which will be secured by Fox Network’s strength. Apart from owning the nation’s #1 cable news channel, the new Fox will gain from the business news channel with highest viewership and a stations group housed in nine of 10 major metro areas in the United States.  It will also own the long-term sports rights to the NFL, MLB, World Cup soccer and NASCAR.Further, the new company will have a sound financial position, backed by unmatched growth and strong free cash flow generation. The company will continue to benefit from higher affiliate rate, rise in retransmission and robust advertising demand for its live content and entertainment product.The spinoff transaction is taxable only to 21st Century Fox and not to its shareholders. The new Fox is likely to distribute an $8.5 billion cash dividend to 21st Century Fox before the completion of the spin-off, which represents an estimate of such tax liability.On completion of the spin-off, every 21st Century Fox shareholder will receive a share of the new Fox in the same class as previously held. The company will maintain two classes of common stock: Class A Common and Class B Common voting rights.The Merger TransactionPer the deal, the shareholders of 21st Century Fox will be entitled to take delivery of 0.2745 shares of Disney, against each share of 21st Century Fox. Further, Disney will take on 21st Century Fox’s $13.7 billion of net debt, consequently bringing the total transaction value for the deal to $66.1 billion. The previously mentioned $52.4 billion only makes for the equity component of the deal. The total enterprise value of the combined entity is estimated to be about $69 billion.As part of the stock transaction, Disney is expected to issue 515 million new shares, which will be distributed to shareholders of 21st Century Fox. This represents nearly 25% stake in Disney on a pro-forma basis. The exchange ratio of 0.2745 Disney shares for every share of 21st Century Fox has been set on a 30-day volume weighted average price of Disney stock.However, there are some adjustments to tax liabilities arising from the aforementioned spinoff and other transactions under the deal, which may alter this initial ratio.How will Disney Benefit from the Acquisition?The merger between the two media biggies will bring 21st Century Fox’s popular film production businesses, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures and Fox 2000, as well as its storied television creative units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21 under Disney’s ambit. Additionally, Disney’s entertainment business will be enhanced by the inclusion of FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India and Fox’s interests in Hulu, Sky plc, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.Notably, 21st Century Fox remain committed to closing acquisition deal to buy 61% stake of Sky, which it does not currently. The transaction is anticipated to conclude by Jun 30, 2018.Disney sees this acquisition as an opportunity to enhance portfolio of everyone’s favorite franchises and branded content to strengthen its direct-to-consumer offerings. Further, this transaction will expand Disney’s international revenue mix and exposure.In the international market, the company will gain from the addition of Sky serving about 23 million families in UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy. Further, Fox Networks International broadcasting, which operates more than 350 channels in 170 countries is going to be valuable addition. Moreover, the company will significantly boost its viewership with the inclusion of Star India, which runs 69 channels with 720 million viewers per month across India and more than 100 other countries.Moreover, management at 21st Century Fox believes this combination will considerably enhance shareholder value as Disney continues to grow in a dynamic industry. Further, 21st Century Fox expects the able leadership of Bob Iger through the transition is likely to benefit the new company. For this, Iger has accepted to remain as Chairman and CEO of Disney through 2021.How Did the Shares React?Shares of both 21st Century Fox and Disney reacted positively to the news, rising 6.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Overall, 21st Century Fox has surged 31.6% in three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 21%. Meanwhile, Disney has jumped 12.7%, also surpassing the industry’s growth of 1.3%.Our TakeWe believe the deal could be turning point for Disney, which for quite some time now has been struggling in the fast changing media landscape, where rise in streaming and cord cutting have become two faces of the coin. The acquisition will not only enhance Disney’s bargaining power with Cable TV providers, but also increase affiliate fees, provide a fresh lease of life to ESPN and create cost synergies.Though regulatory approvals for the deal should not be a hindrance, we would prefer to wait till the end before jumping to conclusions, any untoward situation as in the case of AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) deal to buy Time Warner  would be disheartening.Both 21st Century Fox and Disney currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1492,FOXA,"Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report) are riding high on encouraging start to the fiscal 2018, strategic investments and buyouts as well as robust EBITDA growth view. In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 28%, against the industry’s decline of 8.7%. However, these signs of optimism are clouded by decline in Television Production revenues and fewer movies in fiscal 2018. Let’s delve deeper and find out more.Hidden CatalystLions Gate Entertainment always seeks strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance competitive position and maximize returns, along with building a diversified portfolio for future growth. In fiscal 2017, Lions Gate completed the acquisition of media and entertainment company Starz. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Media Networks’ segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenue growth of 9.2% year over year on account of Starz new series American Gods and The White Princess as well as due to the fourth season of the hit series, Power, which returned at the end of reported quarter. Recently, Lions Gate and world’s leading leisure park operator, Parques Reunidos have entered into a strategic partnership to develop Lions Gate branded indoor entertainment center in New York's Times Square.With the increasing popularity of eSports, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has invested in the eSports franchise The Immortals. The Immortals competes with famous online video games like League of Legends, Counterstrike GO, Overwatch and Super Smash Brothers. This move might surprise many as most are unaware of the popularity of eSports. Over the past few years, eSports competitions have increased and the company expects eSports market to grow over $1 billion by the next year. The company believes that eSports has “the potential to transform the face of sports entertainment.”Lions Gate, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), anticipates EBITDA growth in the range of low to mid-teens over the next few years. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $181.5 million, compared with $10.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Hurdles to CrossDecline in Television Production revenues in the past couple of quarters have been a concern for investors. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Television Production revenues dropped 18.6% to $156.6 million following a decline of 3.5% in the previous quarter. The company released 18 theatrical films in fiscal 2017 compared with 14 releases in the fiscal 2016.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year may hurt the company’s Motion Pictures revenues. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize the margins.2 Media Stocks to Steal the ShowBetter-ranked stocks worth considering include Gray Television, Inc.

1493,FOXA,"The year has not been an encouraging one for Movie/TV Production/Distribution industry so far but despite belonging to the same industry World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) has managed to navigate smoothly. Year to date, the industry has witnessed a marginal decline of 0.5% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 12.8%. Stocks such as IMAX Corporation (IMAX  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and MSG Networks Inc. (MSGN  -  Free Report), which belong to the aforementioned industry, have witnessed a decline of 26.4%, 5% and 0.7%, respectively.However, the sluggish run of these stocks in the bourses have been to an extent mitigated by the exceptional performance of  WWE, whose shares have rallied 28.4% year to date. The bullish run of the stock may arouse your curiosity about how WWE managed to outperform the industry. Let’s find out the factors behind the stock’s upsurge.Record Revenues GrowthThe year 2016 registered record revenues generation in the history of the WWE. The company’s record revenues primarily came on the back of substantial increase in revenues in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and gain in WWE Network’s total subscriber base. The company has carried the momentum of 2016 in to 2017, with the first and second quarter witnessing revenue growth of 10% and 8%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales increase of 7.2% for 2017, higher than the industry’s growth estimate of 6.9%.Strategic Efforts to Augment Top Line FurtherWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its earlier deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries.The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership. Per the deal, both the companies have signed multi-year agreement for airing WWE programming, which comprises of WWE’s leading shows including the likes of Raw as well as SmackDown.In July, in an effort to augment revenues WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. The company has also recently reached an agreement to broadcast hit programs like Raw and SmackDown in Japan, Caribbean and Australia. Notably, WWE and TVA Sports also signed an agreement for airing Raw in French, beginning Oct 10.OIBDA View Looks EncouragingManagement is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of $100 million for 2017, which is nearly up 25% from the 2016. In first-half 2017, the company has already generated adjusted OIBDA of $36.7 million. For the third quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million driven by top-line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees. In the fourth quarter, it anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $28-$32 million.WWE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1494,FOXA,"Investor concerns regarding ESPN’s future, lower-than-expected top-line and rating decline at youth-focused Disney Channel are hurting the media behemoth, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report). The company’s shares have declined 11.5% in the past six months, marginally wider that the industry’s decline of 11.1%. Recently, the stock further came under pressure after CEO cautioned that fiscal 2017 earnings are likely to be similar to last year.What’s Hurting the Stock?Over the last few quarters, Disney’s ESPN has been closely monitored by investors because of its performance. Identical to performances in the past few quarters, ESPN disappointed investors in the third-quarter fiscal 2017 again. Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN were the major concerns this quarter too. Most media companies are failing to cope with ""cord cutting"" as consumers are unwilling to pay for large bundles of channels.Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming drove the overall programming cost higher for ESPN. The company expects programming costs to increase 8% year over year due to $600 million in incremental costs linked with the first year of the company’s fresh NBA contract. Out of $600 million expenses, $400 million incurred in the third quarter.Disney’s top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four straight quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues came in at $14,238 million, almost flat year over year but missed the consensus mark of $14,442 million on account of higher programming costs at ESPN as this is the first year of fresh NBA contract and sharp decline in Studios Entertainment revenues.With its huge international presence, Disney remains prone to unfavorable foreign currency translations which may have an adverse impact on its top and bottom-line results. Management had earlier cautioned that lack of hedges at favorable rates against forex volatility will squeeze out $175 million from its fiscal 2017 operating income.Can the Stock Bounce Back?Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Disney which had earlier acquired 33% stake in BAMTech announced its intention to acquire another 42% stake in the firm. Per the agreement, the company will have to shell out $1.58 billion to buy another 42% stake in BAMTech. The company stated that it will use BAMTech to create an ESPN-branded, over-the-top video streaming service that will cover a variety of sports. Disney is striving to make its content accessible to more customers.Recently, the company stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019. Instead, the company will have its own streaming services — one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers. Disney will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will air Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Meanwhile, through the fresh Disney-branded service subscribers can view both Disney’s and Pixar’s latest live action and animated movies, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate. Movies like Toy Story 4, the sequel to Frozen and The Lion King will also be streamed. This step gives an indication that Disney is confident about distributing content itself without relying on Netflix or any other companies.We believe these efforts along with tremendous performance of parks & resorts business and movie business can help the stock bounce back in the near future.Given the above factors, Disney, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), Time Warner Inc.  and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.

1495,FOXA,"Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) Telemundo is set to create history by taking the number one position in the Spanish-language television network, edging out Univision and Unimas for the first time. Reportedly, Telemundo became the most-watched Spanish-language network in prime time the first time for a full TV season.Telemundo is an American Spanish-language terrestrial television network owned by Comcast through NBC Universal’s division, NBC Universal Telemundo Enterprises. Notably, Mexican pay-TV and broadcasting behemoth, Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV  -  Free Report) owns upto 49% of U.S. Spanish-language TV network Univision Inc.'s voting stock.Both Comcast and Grupo Televisa currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per data from Nielsen Holdings, a global information, data, and measurement company,  Telemundo will have the biggest share of the two demographics, 18-49 years and 18-34years, from Monday to Friday in the 8pm-11pm primetime viewing. The network registered its highest share ever in Spanish-language television, surpassing Univision and Unimas among 18-49 years (43%) and 18-34 years (45%). Telemundo also ranked among the top 5 broadcast networks with NBC, ABC, CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), during the season and outperformed all cable networks, except ESPN, in the key demos.In 2017, Telemundo added a few distribution agreements with online video services including Hulu and FuboTV. Earlier this year, Telemundo signed a content-production deal with Vice Media to start original documentary segments for Telemundo News and a one-hour hosted weekly show for Universo. Both programs are expected to debut in the fall.In the last few years, Telemundo's programming has evolved with its audience, considering the way they consume media and the type of content they prefer. The network's business model was designed to produce original content, positioning Telemundo as the only network that offers high-quality content across all platforms. The programs specifically targeted Hispanics living in the United States. Telemundo has been part of this rapidly evolving market and has demonstrated a better understanding of what resonates and is relevant to this new audience, across all platforms.For the sixth consecutive year, Telemundo is the top Hispanic network.  In August, Telemundo secured the top spot among broadcast network in Total Engagement according to Shareablee, the social media metrics company.  The shows El Señor de los Cielos and Sin Senos Sí Hay Paraíso, ranked No.1 and 2, respectively, among all broadcast drama series in Facebook.The achievement came on the back of the network's commitment to redefining Hispanic media and providing action-packed, contemporary stories that connect well with their audiences. In fact, Telemundo claimed the top three highest-rated series in all Spanish-language television in weekday prime time from 8pm to 11pm among adults 18-49 and adults 18-34.Price Performance Over the past three months, shares of Comcast declined 6.2% as against the 0.7% gain of the industry it belongs to. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1496,FOXA,"Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.‘s (FOXA  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of remaining 61% stake in Europe’s leading pay-TV broadcaster Sky plc hit a further roadblock after U.K. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley demanded detailed review from the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”).Bradley had earlier demanded a review as the deal “potentially raises public interest concerns”. However, what came as a surprise is that she now also wants reviewers to examine the company’s commitment to broadcasting standards.The U.K.’s Office of Communications commonly known as Ofcom had no problem regarding Twenty-First Century Fox’s capability to match U.K. broadcasting criteria. Earlier, Bradley also had no concerns about the company’s commitment toward broadcasting standards. As the matter is referred for further review the company expects deal to be sealed by Jun 30, 2018.We believe this is a major setback for Twenty-First Century Fox. The deal which is valued at $15.2 billion will strengthen the company’s position in pay-TV network in Britain, Ireland, Austria, Germany and Italy. As of 2016, Sky already has 21 million pay-TV subscribers and 30,000 employees. Moreover, the deal will reinforce Sky’s position in entertainment and sport, and will also augment adjusted earnings and free cash flow.Despite this discouraging news mot much movement was witnessed in the company’s share price. However, we noted that the stock has declined 15.1% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decrease of 11.5%. Over the same period, other stocks from the same space which include Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.

1497,FOXA,"Today is the day: tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is holding its much-hyped keynote event at the brand-new Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California. It is the first-ever event at the theater, which is located at the company’s corporate headquarters and dedicated to Apple’s late co-founder.Heading into today, Apple shares were up nearly 37% so far this year. The company has proven to be one of Wall Street’s hottest tech stocks, at least partially thanks to the anticipation surrounding Apple’s new line of hardware announced today.Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports “B” grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system. The next few days should prove to be a telling period for the stock, as investors and analysts will likely attempt to gauge the consumer market’s reaction to today’s announcements.Apple TVPrior to today’s official announcement, we had heard that Apple was clashing with prominent Hollywood studios over the pricing of 4K content. According to several media reports, Apple wanted to charge $20 for ultra-high-definition movies on its new Apple TV device, while the studios it was negotiating with wanted the company to charge more.Today, Apple officially announced Apple TV 4K, and the company’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue unveiled the new version of the iPhone maker’s television venture.Two key technologies make this edition of Apple TV stand out from other cord cutting options: 4K and HDR, though these two technologies are not new, and are a combination that has been around for a while now. Apple has also redesigned the Apple TV user interface in 4K.Apple went on to announce a new A10X processing chip with 2x CPU performance, as well as a new version of tvOS.While looks certainly matter, better access to programming is key, and Apple appeared to deliver on this front. The company looks to be working with studios like 20th Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), Lionsgate, Paramount, Universal, Warner Brothers, and Sony Pictures (SNE  -  Free Report), and is also working with Hollywood to get all of its 4K HDR content on iTunes.Additionally, 4K movies will be the same price as HD movie in iTunes, and customers will receive an automatic upgrade to 4K if they bought HD movies.Most notably, Apple announced that it is working with streaming leaders Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon Prime (AMZN  -  Free Report) to bring its 4K titles to iTunes. And, the Amazon Prime Video app will be available “later this year” on Apple TV.Another big announcement is the arrival of Live Sports and Live News to Apple TV. Users will even be able to turn the score feature off for certain games.The Apple TV 4K starts at $179 for 32GB and $199 for 64GB, and customers can place their orders on September 15.

1498,FOXA,"Yesterday, the U.S. media sector saw sell-offson the double whammy of Hurricane Irma (and Harvey to some extent) and downbeat guidance issued by management of Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). Disney lost about 4.4% on Sep 7, while it added about 0.04% after hours, and Comcast retreated about 6.2% on Sep 7.Behind the Downcast MoodFlorida is bracing up to face Hurricane Irma on Friday and has issued a state of emergency. Since the storm is deemed to be the most powerful to lash out on the U.S. mainland since 1992, Miami is readying for its largest evacuation in almost a decade (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).Though Disney remains open, many of its events have been called off. Disney's Blizzard Beach will be shut on Friday and Saturday, “the park's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground will be closed beginning Saturday 2 P.M.”, as per the source. Disney was shut down in 2016 for Hurricane Matthew.Added to this, Disney CEO Bog Iger cautioned about profits this year which are likely to be similar to last year. The company reported $5.72 in earnings per share for fiscal 2016, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.87) for the current year.On the other hand, Universal Studios of Comcast Corporation also cancelled Saturday's ""Rock the Universe"" concert due to Irma. Comcast’s management warned about a significant drop in subscribers during the third quarter. As many as 150,000 video subscribers could be lost in the quarter.Comcast management attributed the loss in subscribers to stiff competition in the telecom sector, as the industry grapples with pressures from streaming. However, management also held two big hurricanes in the quarter responsible for subscriber loss. “Comcast management said this quarter has been one of the most competitive in recent memory,” going by an article published on MarketWatch.Impact on Industry Such downbeat indications from two industry biggies acted as a cornerstone for the entire space, though some of the players have positions in the streaming market. Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report), which is a broadband communications and video services provider, lost about 3.4%. Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), a global entertainment content company, was off about 3.6%. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) shed about 2.4%. Mass media company CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) fell about 2.1% on Sep 7.

1499,FOXA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Twenty-First Century has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Twenty-First Century’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18.2 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Twenty-First Century’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Twenty-First Century has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, FOXA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Twenty-First Century currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Twenty-First Century a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Twenty-First Century might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C. This gives FOXA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped 5.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by about 1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and Consensus  Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and Consensus | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. QuoteIn light of these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTwenty-First Century is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank (Bottom 36%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

1501,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) $52.4 billion purchase of some of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) most valuable assets is official. Now, it’s time to take a look beyond Disney’s new majority share in Hulu and the fusion of the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe and dive into what could be the biggest reason Disney made the deal: live sports.The deal that was announced on Thursday will see Disney acquire the Twentieth Century Fox television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic, and other cable assets. Left off the deal are Fox News, Fox Business and the main Fox Broadcasting network, as well as FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network (also read: 21st Century Fox Shares Surge After Disney Deal Made Official).But Disney did grab an array of properties, including Star India, Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report), and Fox’s 22 regional sports networks, that could prove invaluable and make it a local and global sports giant for years to come.Sports-Based HopeESPN’s struggles are widely known, and the sports entertainment powerhouse has lost a fair bit of steam in recent years.Many consider the company’s multibillion-dollar Monday Night Football contract and its nine-year, $24 billion NBA TV rights agreement—which it shares with Turner—as bloated deals weighing the ‘World Wide Leader in Sports’ down.The company has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs in the last year alone, and ESPN’s subscriber numbers have fallen to 88 million from their roughly 100 million peak in 2011.Yet, the company’s losses can be attributed in large part to cable’s decline, as viewers who may have never watched ESPN—even though it came on their standard cable package—leave in favor of streaming services. In fact, ESPN’s subscriber fees have gone up in recent years and remain one of the highest in all of cable.ESPN is banking on the fact that sports will always be watched live. This would give the network the advantage in the eyes of most advertisers, as nearly all other regularly scheduled TV programs can be consumed on-demand on Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), or other streaming services, without diminishing the product.How It Can Grow As part of the deal, Disney will acquire Fox’s current ownership of U.K. TV powerhouse Sky TV and Sky Sports, which is nearly the equivalent of ESPN in the U.K. This gives the network the rights to the English Premier League—one of the most watched and valuable soccer leagues in the world. On top of that, Disney now owns the rights to the network’s golf, darts, cricket and Formula One properties.With the acquisition of Star India, Disney now holds a massive TV presence in one of the world’s fastest growing and largest economies. The Indian network’s Star Sports boasts 10 different channels and holds the rights to the Olympics, as well as Indian soccer leagues.Star India also recently won the worldwide rights to broadcast and stream Indian Premier League cricket for the next five years. The company spent $2.55 billion to beat out the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Sony (SNE  -  Free Report). Nearly 1.3 billion viewers reportedly watched India’s top cricket league last season.ESPN is also set to take over Fox’s 22 regional sports networks in the U.S., which currently have deals with 44 professional sports teams throughout the NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS and college sports.In many markets around the country, sports fans ranked RSNs ahead of all other cable channels, including ESPN and HBO, in terms of their importance, based on a 2016 Nielsen survey.“We have long known that our RSNs are akin to the fifth broadcast network in their markets in terms of ratings, and Nielsen’s research confirms the remarkable importance of these networks to viewers,” Fox Sports executive Jeff Krolik said last year.“Local sports are tribal, and RSNs inspire the same loyalty and connection as the hometown teams they bring to fans.”Disney’s acquisition of Fox’s 22 regional sports networks is worth roughly $23 billion on its own, which makes these local sports networks worth more than one-third of the total value of the deal—including debt.Bottom Line The 21st Century Fox deal was made to fight off streaming powers and give the company more content at a time when owning it will prove more and more valuable as the way people consume it changes.The deal also gives Disney more possibilities for the planned standalone ESPN streaming services. This acquisition also allows for what could eventually become a skinny standalone streaming offering that includes regional live sports, ESPN, Indian cricket, and every movie and TV show Disney’s new mega-studio produces.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1502,FOXA,"Shares of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) surged on Thursday morning after the entertainment giant’s highly anticipated deal with the Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) became official.The companies announced in a joint statement Thursday that they entered into a definitive agreement that will see Disney acquire a substantial amount of 21st Century Fox’s assets, including the Twentieth Century Fox television and film studios. The deal, which also includes international TV businesses and cable offerings, is worth $52.4 billion in stock.Disney will also officially acquire FX Networks, National Geographic, Fox Sports Regional Networks and Fox Networks Group International. Furthermore, Star India, U.K. TV power Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report), Fox’s 30% stake in streaming giant Hulu, and a few other assets, are also set to fall under Disney’s umbrella.Notably left out of the deal are Fox News; Fox Business; the main Fox Broadcasting network; and 21st Century Fox’s popular cable sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network. Fox will retain these assets in a newly listed company, which will be spun off to its shareholders.As part of the deal, Disney will also take on roughly $13.7 billion of 21st Century Fox’s debt. This brings the total value of the planned transaction to $66.1 billion. Current 21st Century Fox shareholders are scheduled to receive 0.2745 shares of Disney for every 21st Century Fox share they hold.Disney’s Wins?Disney made this deal to try to bolster its arsenal of entertainment assets as the race to provide consumers with the most content heats up. By joining the array of Fox’s filmed entertainment assets with Disney’s content, the new company should be better positioned to entice customers with a planned over-the-top, direct-to-consumer platform.“The deal will also substantially expand our international reach, allowing us to offer world-class storytelling and innovative distribution platforms to more consumers in key markets around the world,” Disney CEO Robert Iger said in a statement.The newly strengthened Disney also takes a controlling interest in Hulu and inches closer to a sports stranglehold, even as ESPN struggles, with the acquisition of Fox’s 22 regional sports networks (also read: Is Disney the Real Winner in a Deal With 21st Century Fox?).What’s more, Disney boosts its international reach with powerful new international cable assets that could help it distribute more of the company’s content worldwide, which could eventually lead to the creation of more Disney stores and theme parks.Disney also pointed directly to the company’s ability to merge Fox’s Marvel assets, which include X-Men and Deadpool, with its widely popular and revenue generating Marvel Cinematic Universe.Bottom Line From 21st Century Fox’s standpoint, the company and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, seem to be willing to part ways with valuable assets during these changing media times.

1503,FOXA,"As initially reported a couple weeks ago, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) has agreed to terms in buying film and TV business assets from 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal ($66.1 billion including debt). Fox shareholders will be granted a 25% stake in Disney, and Disney CEO Bob Iger will remain in charge through at least 2021.This is a true blockbuster deal in the greater entertainment industry — the company that began feature-length animation films in 1937 with the release of “Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs” and controls the entire catalogue of Pixar, “Pirates of the Caribbean” and many, many others will now bring in the entire Star Wars and “Frozen” franchises. The deal is expected to be completed in 12-18 months, and it has already been stated that Disney will first complete its acquisition of European communications company Sky.Should another suitor attempt to cut in on this mega-merger process, it will cost them a $1.25 billion breakup fee — enough to likely keep all challengers at bay. Currently, Disney carries the risk to the tune of $2.5 billion in fostering this deal, which is valued at $40 per share for FOXA shareholders.This deal does not include other segments within the Fox company, such as Fox News, Fox Sports or Fox Business.

1505,FOXA,"A deal that would see the Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) purchase a substantial amount of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets is all but done, according to multiple reports from sources inside the meeting rooms. Now, as questions about which side comes out on top start to flow, let’s dive into the details of the deal and focus on how Disney stands to benefit.What Disney GetsThe potential Disney and 21st Century Fox deal is said to center around the Twentieth Century Fox television and movie studios. Disney would also acquire FX and the National Geographic Channel, as well as a stake in European TV giant Sky Plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report).On top of those assets, Disney would also acquire Fox’s 30% stake in Hulu. This move would up Disney’s ownership of the streaming television power to 60%. What’s more, Disney would also acquire Fox’s 22 regional sports networks, which are worth roughly $23 billion, according to MoffettNathanson.Left out of a potential Disney and 21st Century Fox deal would be the company’s flagship Fox News and Fox Business channels, as well as the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1.Disney’s planned acquisition comes at a time when the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have stormed into the filmed entertainment business and sparked a cord-cutting revolution that has helped shake-up the television and movie business permanently.The ProsDisney would be able to leverage 21st Century Fox’s television and movie studio businesses in order to help increase and bolster its content offerings. This, in turn, could give Disney greater leverage when it tries to roll out its over the top, direct-to-consumer video streaming service in the next few years.A stand-alone streaming service that combines all of Disney’s and Fox’s movies and TV shows stands a much better chance of attracting subscribers than an only Disney platform.Disney is also set to gain a controlling stake in Hulu, which the company could use as a platform to build from. However, Disney also owns streaming tech firm BAMTech and could relatively easily introduce its own platform and let Hulu standalone as a separate asset.Furthermore, as Disney’s Marvel movie franchise continues to expand, the deal could bring together the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the characters and franchises Fox owns, including the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Deadpool.Disney would also gain powerful international cable assets that could help them distribute more of the company’s content worldwide, which could eventually lead to the creation of more Disney stores and theme parks.One of the last major motivating factors for the owner of the struggling ESPN is that the company would collect a plethora of regional sports networks. Fox’s 22 city and area-specific sports networks paired with ESPN’s assets—which includes stakes in three of the biggest college conference networks—could give the company a stranglehold on sports in many areas.Disney’s move could also improve the company’s plan to offer a stand-alone streaming version of ESPN as early as next year. “It would be an embracement of riches for Disney if they get this deal done,” Macquarie Capital senior media analyst Tim Nollen said on CNBC.But this possible domination is where potential antitrust concerns begin to heat up.The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T (T  -  Free Report) in order to try to block its planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner . This case could signal that the DOJ might try to block the expected Disney and 21st Century Fox deal, or at least try to limit its scope.However, those antitrust concerns are purely speculative for the time being, and they do not seem to have deterred Disney and Fox from trying to reach this massive deal.Bottom LineFrom 21st Century Fox’s standpoint, the company and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, seem to be willing to part ways with valuable assets during these changing media times. And speculation surrounding this deal has helped drive up FOXA shares over the last few weeks.Disney seems to be readying itself to do battle in this new media age by grabbing a bigger stake in everything from sports to movies.Shares of FOXA sunk over 3.50% on Wednesday, only days after hitting their new 52-week high. Disney’s stock price remained little changed.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1506,FOXA,"Shares of Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) climbed on Tuesday morning after the company announced that it officially bowed out of the fight to buy some of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets. This move leaves the Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) as the lone remaining bidder, in a deal that could now close as soon as this week.The cable and media powerhouse decided, in the end, not to pursue a deal to acquire some of 21st Century Fox’s most notable assets, including the Twentieth Century Fox television and movie studios. Comcast’s decision to walk away from the deal comes after a few weeks of speculation surrounding a possible deal (also read: Will There Be a Bidding War for 21st Century Fox's Major Assets?).“When a set of assets like 21st Century Fox’s becomes available, it’s our responsibility to evaluate if there’s a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said in a statement. “That’s what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”Shares of Comcast rose over 2.61% following the announcement that it would no longer pursue a 21st Century Fox deal.Comcast’s move presents Disney with the option to go ahead and complete a deal with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Disney could announce a 21st Century Fox deal as early as this week,according to multiple reports from people close to the negations.Disney, which has hit a rough patch this year, especially as its sports media network struggles, could benefit from a deal that would make the entertainment giant an even bigger player in television and movies.The potential Disney and 21st Century Fox deal is said to center around Twentieth Century Fox television and movie studios—including FX and National Geographic Channel—as well as a stake in European TV giant Sky Plc (SKYAY). On top of those assets, Disney would also acquire Fox’s 30% stake in streaming television power Hulu. This move would up Disney’s ownership in the company to 60% and could help the entrainment power as it pursues its own stand-alone streaming services in 2018.Left out of a potential Disney and Fox deal would be the company’s flagship Fox News and Fox Business channels, as well as the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1.Shares of FOXA climbed 1.44% in morning trading to inch close to their 52-week intraday trading high. Disney saw its stock price gain around 0.52%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1507,FOXA,"Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares climbed on Tuesday morning after Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) upgraded the media giant’s stock.Wells Fargo upgraded Disney from ""market perform"" to ""outperform"" and raised its price target to $116 a share from $109 a share, which would mark a 14% gain from Friday's close. The firm pointed to Disney’s new commitment to enter the streaming and over-the-top programming sector as the key reason for its renewed faith in the media powerhouse.Disney recently announced that it expects to introduce a Disney brand direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. The company also hopes to roll out a streaming version of the struggling ESPN channel as soon as 2018.“With DIS’s foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can’t help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,” Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), FOXA (FOXA  -  Free Report), and DIS…”Disney announced in early August that the company would leave Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to set up an exclusive streaming platform for all Disney and Pixar movies.""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" Ryvicker noted. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media.""Wells Fargo also said that if Disney’s move into video streaming is successful that “we might even see the stock return to trading at a 1-2x premium to the market, putting the stock at $128/share.”Disney’s stock has had an up and down year thus far, and shares of the conglomerate have dropped significantly from its 52-week high water mark of $116 a share that it reached in April.Shares of Disney popped over 1% in morning trading on Tuesday, but now hover around 0.50% higher than Friday’s closing price at $102 a share.Other Note Highlights Ryvicker upgraded Disney based on a strong belief in the company’s ability to successfully progress into the world of digital streaming. The same Wells Fargo note cautioned investors about media companies that don’t have enough exposure in nonlinear television.The analyst pointed to three companies—Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report), Scripps Networks , and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report)—as media outlets that could potentially be hurt as the shift towards streaming continues to heat up.Ryvicker singled out Viacom as being particularly exposed and downgraded the stock accordingly. Ryvicker downgraded Viacom’s non-voting stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” The analyst also lowered her price target from $43 a share to $32 a share. Shares of Scripps Networks fell marginally, while Discovery Communications saw its stock price sink by around 1% to touch a new 52-week intraday trading low of $21.89 a share.Viacom’s class B shares dropped by over 3.20% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low. The company’s voting  shares dipped by roughly 2%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1508,FOXA,"On May 23, Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) said that it is in the process of preparing a superior all-cash offer for the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) has already shown interest in. Understandably, broadcasters are trying to make their international presence stronger given the stiff competition they are facing from streaming giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), which are fast invading their space and changing the entire ballgame.Interestingly, Netflix briefly surpassed Disney in market value on May 24 wining the crown of the most valuable media company in the world. Against this backdrop, as Comcast prepares for a formal all-cash offer, it now needs to be seen where Fox finally builds its new den.Comcast to Gain From Fox Acquisition Comcast heated up the acquisition war on May 23 after announcing that it is in the final stages of preparing a fresh all-cash offer of an estimated $60 billion to buy the assets of Fox. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox last year had agreed to sell it film and television studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets to Disney in a $52.4 billion deal.Before entering into a deal with Disney, Fox had rejected Comcast’s offer to buy its assets, citing it as too risky although the bid was higher. However, Comcast’s recent announcement is a fresh challenge to both Fox and Disney, as they gear up to take their deal to shareholders this summer.This is because, Fox might feel optimistic about the deal after recent indications that a judge might rule in favor of the Time Warner Inc  and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) merger. The decision is expected on Jun 12 and a positive outcome might ease regulatory concerns and boost Comcast’s confidence in making an official offer.Comcast has graduated from a cable television giant to a diversified media company. Taking over Fox makes sense to Comcast at a time when its rivals are scaling up. Charter Communication, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is aggressively working on mobile expansion, while AT&T’s bid to buy out Time Warner is in a move to enhance its pay TV and digital content. Given this scenario, taking over Fox will only strengthen Comcast’s broadcasting arm.Disney Still Favored by FoxDespite Comcast announcing its plans of making a fresh all-cash deal to Fox, Murdoch’s company is in favor of Disney because an all-stock offer will save the company from coughing up a huge tax amount. Whereas, an all-cash deal will make Fox pay up huge tax. Also, Disney has a bigger brand and global presence than Comcast and at the same time many of Fox’s parts are a perfect fit with Disney’s strengths.   Moreover, a Fox-Disney is unlikely to face regulatory problems that a Fox-Comcast deal bears the risk of. From Disney’s perspective too, Fox is a lucrative acquisition given that it is facing increased competition from the likes of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Disney also has plans of removing its content from Netflix in 2018. Given this scenario, acquiring Fox would add muscle to Disney’s broadcasting arm, as the deal will help it to get its film studio content, Fox TV, FX networks and National Geographic Channel.The Bigger War The biggest story amid all these bids and counter bids is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money and the only way to stay in the race is by expanding and diversifying their content.In fact, Netflix has already said that it will dedicate $8 billion in 2018 solely to content. Comcast’s recent decision to add Netflix to its bundled offering further proves the growing demand and preference for online content. Although it too early to predict a winner, it makes sense for broadcasting giants to diversify their portfolio to survive the onslaught of streaming giants.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1509,FOXA,"Reportedly, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is ready to pay more than Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) offer of $52.4 billion for 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, only if a federal judge approves AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) planned takeover of Time Warner .According to regulatory filing, Comcast along with Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) had been an early suitor for Fox’s assets that includes Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios, as well as cable and international TV businesses.However, Fox didn’t find Verizon’s all-stock offer lucrative at that time. The company also rejected Comcast’s offer due to regulatory concerns. The cable giant had also suggested divestitures, which however, failed to satisfy Fox’s management.Moreover, Comcast’s refusal to entertain a reverse break-up fee, in case of a regulatory blockage sealed the fate of the deal. Notably, Disney’s offer for Fox’s assets includes a $2.5 billion termination fee clause. However, the offer of $29.54 per share is lower than Comcast’s previous offer of $34.41 per share.Comcast Planning an All-Cash BidPer CNBC, “Comcast originally touted its strong stock as a reason for Fox to accept a deal from the largest U.S. cable provider instead of Disney.” Comcast Corporation Price and Consensus Comcast Corporation Price and Consensus | Comcast Corporation Quote However, shares of Comcast have declined 18.5% since Disney’s announcement of Fox’s asset acquisition. The company now believes an all-cash bid will find preference from Fox’s shareholders.Notably, Comcast has also submitted a $31-billion offer to take over Sky plc. Fox which holds 39% stake in Sky. It had earlier offered $16.5 billion to take over the remaining assets of Sky, which however, were marred by regulatory intervention.Fox had expected the deal to complete in mid-2018, which is now uncertain following Comcast’s higher bid.Why Comcast is So Eager to Buy Fox & Sky Assets?Fox’s asset and Sky acquisition will boost Comcast’s international exposure. Per Bloomberg, Fox’s Star operates 58 channels in eight languages in India, while Sky is one of the largest pay-TV companies in Europe.The deal will consolidate two of the six major Hollywood studios under one banner and will help Comcast compete against the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.Fox’s large library of TV shows and movies like The Simpsons and Avatar will also boost Comcast’s content portfolio.The Murdoch Factor Can Save DisneyComcast’s premium price offering will surely escalate tension in the Fox-Disney deal. In fact, a shareholder like TCI Fund Management, which owns almost 7.4% stake per Reuters, believes that Fox’s board should sell the company to the highest bidder.However, Comcast can find it difficult to win over Rupert Murdoch, largest shareholder of Fox, through an all-cash deal, as it will attract significant capital gain tax. This can finally help Disney to clinch the deal.Zacks RankCurrently, both Comcast and Disney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1510,FOXA,"Currently, we are seeing the first of several lightened trading volume episodes in the market for calendar 2018: Memorial Day Weekend. The exodus to temporarily relaxing climes begins arounds now-ish, and we expect lower volumes to be with us as Q1 earnings season is mostly in the rearview mirror. We’re not even seeing much through the geopolitical lens, with a U.S./China “trade war” on “hold,” the Eurozone slowly gaining more traction, and nothing really acute anywhere around the world, headline-wise, pulling focus.We’re seeing an implied open for our major indexes down this morning, nevertheless. Even with oil prices solidifying in the profitable $70-plus range, the Dow pre-market is down roughly 150 points, the Nasdaq -60 points and the S&P 500 -15. Perhaps, as Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras has stated this morning, that the downturn in sentiment which began yesterday has to do with the lack of progress regarding peace negotiations with North Korea (although read the article to see why he rejects this premise). Or, perhaps as our early week drifted shares higher without much outside force pushing or pulling it, we’re drifting lower for the very same reason.We do see Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) preparing an all-cash offer for 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, reportedly at a premium to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) offer previously. However, we’re not being fed a dollar amount for this offer, only that preparation is at “advanced stages.” This is the sort of thing that grabs headlines around Memorial Day. We may see a counter-offer from Disney or we may not, depending, but in either case we see Fox stock up but Disney and Comcast shares down in today’s early session.One thing that springs to mind about either Comcast or Disney growing content exponentially with Fox’s assets is that media companies are all attempting to reach behemoth levels. We’ve already seen other burgeoning mergers such as that between AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner . But is aggressive amassing of mass media outlets really a good thing for consumers — or the market?Venture capitalist Roger McNamee last month discussed just this phenomenon: that tech and media are growing too big to be essentially profitable. Much the way the government stepped in three-and-a-half decades ago to split up Ma Bell’s “monopoly” in the telecommunications market, McNamee suggests the same should be done for giant tech monoliths like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report). (McNamee, by the way, was an early investor in both stocks.) Only once these giant media conglomerates are forced to hive off into their own distinct companies will they once again unlock real market value.Of course, with things like media mergers pushing things in the opposite direction, McNamee may have to wait a while for this to happen. That said, perhaps we’re simply in the early stages of large-scale morphing in tech and media industries — like cosmic nebulae of billions of dollars in investments — that may transpire over the next several years. This, too, is the sort of things some of us think about when Memorial Day trading volume puts market activity into a relative slumber.

The multi-parent structure allows Hulu to have an enviable content pipeline.Moreover, with the Disney-Fox deal, Disney is expected to gain a 60% stake in Hulu. Post acquisition, the company is likely to direct more of its streaming content toward the platform, which will further boost Hulu’s subscriber base.However, Comcast is reportedly aiming for 21st Century Fox’s assets and is expected to offer $60 billion in cash, higher than Disney’s $52 billion purchase price. The cable giant is expected to submit the bid only if the proposed AT&T and Time Warner deal passes through regulatory appeal.The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus | The Walt Disney Company QuoteCurrently, both Disney and Comcast carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1515,FOXA,"Of late, the Movie/TV Production/Distribution industry has emerged as a favorite with the investors. This is quite evident from the industry’s sharp gain of 24.5% in the past three months. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report), which belongs to the aforementioned industry, has benefited from the trend with the stock gaining 39.2%. Stocks such as IMAX Corporation (IMAX  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), have also witness upsides of 20%, 26.6% and 3.4%, respectively.The bullish run of WWE may have aroused your curiosity but it is the factors that demands have your attention. Let’s delve deep and find out more.Revenues Continue to SurgeThe year 2016 registered record revenue generation in the history of WWE. The company’s record revenues primarily came on the back of substantial increase in revenues in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) and gain in WWE Network’s total subscriber base. The company has carried the momentum of 2016 in to 2017, with the first, second and third quarter witnessing revenue growth of 10%, 8% and 13.5%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales increase of 7.9% for 2017, higher than the industry’s growth estimate of 7.2%.Strategic Efforts Bode WellWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership.In the long haul, the company will continue banking on WWE’s content distribution agreement. Recently, the company stated that distribution agreement, which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues, will expire in 2019 in some regions. Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30, 2019, while in the UK and India it will expire on Dec 31, 2019. The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first-half 2019.Further, in an effort to augment revenues WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. Revenues from international sponsorship increased 29% in the first nine months of 2017 due to joining of blue-chip advertisers such as KFC, Nestlé, AT&T and other gaming partners.OIBDA View Looks EncouragingManagement is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. For 2017, the company is targeting adjusted OIBDA in the band of $108-$112 million, up from the prior estimate of $100 million. For the fourth quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million buoyed by top line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees. For 2018, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $115 million.WWE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Bradley had earlier demanded a review as the deal “potentially raises public interest concerns”. However, what came as a surprise is that she now also wants reviewers to examine the company’s commitment to broadcasting standards. The U.K.’s Office of Communications commonly known as Ofcom had no problem regarding Twenty-First Century Fox’s capability to match U.K. broadcasting criteria. Earlier, Bradley also had no concerns about the company’s commitment toward broadcasting standards.

The tech giant had filed a complaint with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016 over Xiaomi’s application of Mi Pad as an European trademark in 2014.

1518,FOXA,"Per a recent Bloomberg report, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is eyeing the takeover of Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report) — a U.K.-based broadcasting company and European pay-TV provider.Comcast considers Sky’s technological assets superior than other pay-TV providers in Europe. Moreover, the assets will complement Comcast’s X1 platform, Xfinity-branded X1 set-top boxes and wireless services.Comcast’s planned takeover of Sky is a counter measure against The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) attempt to acquire some of the assets of 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA  -  Free Report). Currently, 21st Century Fox holds around a 39.14% stake in Sky. The company has reportedly placed a $15-billion bid for the takeover.Multiple BiddersNotably, Comcast and Walt Disney held talks with 21st Century Fox to acquire the mass media company’s assets. These assets include movie and TV-production studios, FX, National Geographic as well as international assets such as the Star network in India and Sky.U.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications also approached 21st Century Fox about potential acquisitions. However, details regarding the deal were not revealed.  Another development was witnessed, when office heads of Comcast and 21st Century Fox held a meeting in New York.Considering these factors, it is uncertain about who will get 21st Century Fox’s assets.Moreover, regulatory authorities are quite stringent about mergers leading to power consolidation in a single company.

Massive adoption of smartphone and tablets along with continuous development of super-fast data transfer technologies are key drivers of the convergence.

(FOXA  -  Free Report) announced that it has stopped broadcasting news channel Fox News in the United Kingdom amid the company’s planned $15 billion takeover of top pay TV provider Sky.21st Century Fox said the decision was ultimately a business one. Despite the many sexual harassment scandals that plagued the network, Fox News, popular among conservative viewers in the U.S., is still one of the top cable news shows in the country.""Fox News is focused on the U.S. market and designed for a U.S. audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the U.K.,"" Fox said in a statement. ""We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the U.K.,"" the company added.Marketwatch noted that Fox News went off U.K. airwaves at 4:00 PM British time, and according to sources, the channel only averaged about 2,000 viewers a day.Last December, Fox initially proposed the multi-billion-dollar deal to acquire the remaining 61% of Sky that it doesn’t already own. And while the European Commission approved the deal back in April, U.K. culture secretary Karen Bradley said in June that she would likely refer the takeover for additional review with the country’s media watchdogs.In particular, Bradley said she was concerned that the Fox-Sky deal would give the Murdoch family too much power and influence in the media industry, especially over British media; the Murdochs currently control three British newspapers: The Sun, The Times, and The Sunday Times.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Its most recent film, Moana, was released in November 2016, and the studio currently has four films in development including Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 and Gigantic.Pixar, who received funding from late Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) co-founder Steve Jobs—he was also the studio’s majority shareholder before Disney bought the company in 2006—has produced 17 films. It’s most recent film, Cars 3, was released this summer, and Pixar has three upcoming films: Coco, coming to theaters this Thanksgiving, and The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4.Together, these films have earned 13 Academy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, and 11 Grammy Awards. Eight of these films won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature; Up and Toy Story 3 were even nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar. Most recently, Pixar’s critically acclaimed film Inside Out won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.In 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Studios, which has produced many movies based on Marvel comic book characters. Thor: Ragnarok just hit theaters, with Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War coming next year.And in 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm Ltd, the studio best known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises. Last December saw Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first stand-alone film in the Star Wars franchise, hit theaters. The film grossed $1.056 billion at the worldwide box office on a budget of $200 million. Episode 8 of the original franchise, The Last Jedi, is set to hit theaters this December, with Episode 9 already in production.Disney could also count its live-action remakes as a fifth pillar of its studio business now that Beauty and the Beast has proven so successful. During its opening weekend, the film brought in $170 million and total box office numbers surpassed $1 billion. Even more animated classics are planning on coming to life; Disney just announced casting for The Lion King, with Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala.Disney Consumer Products and Interactive MediaThe Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media section of Disney includes primarily the company’s retail store, Disney Store, which has over 400 locations worldwide, as well as brand merchandise from feature films and Disney.com.It also operates The Muppets Studio, which produces Muppet-themed movies and television specials, and Disney Publishing Worldwide, a subsidiary that publishes the popular young adult franchises Star Darling and Waterfire Saga, as well as Hyperion Books for children.Walt Disney Parks and ResortsAside from its animated movies, Disney’s Walt Disney Parks and Resorts are the corporation’s most well-known attractions. Disneyland Park, one of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was Disney’s first major theme park. It first opened back in 1955, and is known for its iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle. The other Anaheim-located park is Disney California, which opened in 2001 and is dedicated to the state of California.  Arguably Disney’s most popular theme park is Walt Disney World Resort, located in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando. Attractions include four major parks: Magic Kingdom Park, home to a life-size version of Cinderella’s castle, the company’s most recognizable landmark; Epcot; Hollywood Studios; and Animal Kingdom Park. The resort is also home to two water parks.Walt Disney Parks and Resorts are not limited to just the U.S. The corporation operates the successful Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, as well as Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which opened its doors in 2005. Disney recently opened its Shanghai Disney Resort in China after years of planning and costs of over $5.5 billion. Disney also operates a popular cruise line.Disney Media NetworksIn addition to popular film franchises, Disney owns and operates many television channels. Its biggest subsidiary under Disney Media Networks is ABC, which produces hit network shows Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder and its flagship evening news program ABC World News Tonight.Disney also owns part of Hulu, an Internet streaming video service, along with 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) (under FOX Broadcasting Company) and Comcast, the world's biggest media company in 2015 (CMCSA  -  Free Report) (under NBCUniversal Television Group).Additionally, Disney has been in talks with Fox to buy most of its assets. Though no deal is confirmed, Fox would reportedly keep its news and sports divisions, and potentially sell the rest of its assets to Disney, i.e. its movie studio and television segments.And recently, the company announced plans for its own streaming service after it pulls its movies from Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) popular video streaming platform. Next year, Disney will launch an ESPN streaming service that will provide access to 10,000 live international, national, and regional games every year. Disney is also debuting a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 that will offer Disney movies and TV shows.Disney owns sports network ESPN, and also operates A&E Networks, in a joint venture with Hearst Corporation. Among its popular television channels include The History Channel and A&E, home to Storage Wars, The First 48, Duck Dynasty, and the scripted series Bates Motel. Disney also owns, of course, The Disney Channel.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1521,FOXA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains breaks down everything investors need to know about the future of the legal sports gambling industry after the U.S. Supreme Court’s historic ruling.At this point, many investors have heard that legalized sports betting could be headed to a state near them. But many questions remain: from which states will adopt sports gambling and which companies stand to benefit the most to how revenues will be taxed.These questions will begin to be sorted out over the next several years. And investors will want to pay close attention because the illegal sports gambling industry is reportedly worth as much as $400 billion a year in the U.S. alone.The big four North American sports leagues, the NFL, NBA, MLB, and the NHL are set to benefit, with billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, going as far as to tell ESPN that the Supreme Court decision “doubled the value of the professional sports franchises in a second.""The leagues hope that legalized sports betting creates more engagement with their sports, which in turn should help them negotiate better television deals with the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), FOX (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), and maybe even Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and other streaming players.Furthermore, tech companies such as Amazon, along with Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) have the infrastructure and user base that could see them benefit from legalized sports betting if they wanted to. Meanwhile, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and some Wall Street financial firms have reportedly applied for sports betting patents.Even if these big-name tech firms don’t roll out their own sports betting platforms, they could easily invest in the array of app-based startups that are sure to pop up as mobile gambling becomes more and more popular. Therefore, the need for real-time data along with fast and secure payments will also become paramount.Investors should pay close attention to how the MGMs (MGM  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) of the world adapt and invest in the future of sports betting. Meanwhile, William Hill WMH, Stars Group TSG, as well as DraftKings and FanDuel, and many other companies could benefit hugely from legalized sports betting.Make sure you listen to the full episode in order to gain a more complete understanding of what the future of sports betting in the U.S. might look like.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1522,FOXA,"If all goes well, you may be lucky enough to witness the Marvel’s first family and its beloved mutants rubbing shoulders with the Earth’s mightiest heroes, as they join forces to fend off threats that can obliterate Earth-616.Yes, you heard it right. Speculation is rife in the market that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender in the race to acquire some properties of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report). The deal, which according to industry experts is valued at approximately $60 billion, is likely to take shape as early next week, per media reports.Per sources, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has been also exploring options to have a piece of 21st Century Fox’s media empire but its the owner of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm that may have the last laugh. Market analysts believe that it would not be of herculean task to get a nod of U.S. antitrust regulators. However, some fear that the deal might face regulatory hurdles, as observed in the case of AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) deal to buy Time Warner .What the Deal Means for Disney?Keeping aside the antitrust issues for the time being, let’s analyze what the deal could mean for Disney, at least on a qualitative basis as of now.The deal could be a bout of fresh air to Disney, which for quite some time now has been jostling in the fast changing media landscape, where rise in streaming and cord cutting have become two faces of the coin. The only possible way out is either you make yourself bigger or get eaten by a bigger fish, or you shrink to focus on core profitable operations.Disney is treading on the right path in its quest to strengthen arms. The accord would give the Mouse House a hold on Fox's regional sports networks (excluding flagship broadcast network, Fox News and the cable sports networks FS1 and FS2), National Geographic cable channels, movie studios, the Star network in India along with a stake in the British broadcaster Sky and video-streaming service Hulu.No wonder, the buyout of these assets would considerably enhance the media mogul’s bargaining power with Cable TV providers, increase affiliate fees, provide a fresh lease of life to ESPN and create cost synergies. Further, the addition of Fox's rich library of movies and TV series would greatly enhance Disney’s prospects in the streaming service. The deal if finalized is also likely to extend the contract of CEO Bob Iger, slated to retire in July 2019, for a smooth integration of Fox’s assets into Disney.An IntrospectionOf late, Disney’s ESPN has been a hot topic in the media industry, which has been grappling with declining subscriber count and higher programming costs. We noted that most of the media companies are failing to cope with cord cutting as consumers are unwilling to pay for large bundles of channels.To overcome this, ESPN has sealed a number of deals with new platform owners, mostly over-the-top. The company had earlier stated that mobile apps are going to play an important role in the future of media, and ESPN is rightly on the way of taking the advantage of the trend with wide range of apps.Disney also plans to launch its own streaming services — one for Disney and Pixar brands, and another for ESPN followers. The company had earlier stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019.The company will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018, and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. Further, blockbuster movies will ensure great business for its Consumer Products division as demand for merchandise associated with blockbusters movies usually skyrockets. Also, addition of these popular themes to Parks & Resorts is likely to increase footfall.Wrapping UpTechnological advancement is playing a major role in how people prefer to watch their favorite programs now days, and with new entertainment products and services available traditional media players are losing competitive leverage. Disney to an extent has been the victim of the same.Nevertheless, the company is taking steps to be become more in sync with the contemporary. The acquisition of BAMTech, the video streaming and data analytics company, can be cited as one of the examples in that direction. Further, a deal with Fox would consolidate its position in the movie business as well as sports broadcasting.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have gained 8.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.1%.

1523,FOXA,"Markets closed lower on Tuesday after investors speculated over the possible effects of retaining the alternate minimum tax in the final tax Bill. Moreover, the S&P 500 posted its third straight day of losses. The Dow and the Nasdaq also ended in the red after suffering broad based losses. Meanwhile, the ISM Service Index for November declined from the 12 year high it had hit a month earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.5%, to close at 24,180.64. However, the S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.4% to close at 2,629.57. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,762.21, losing 0.2%. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.9% to close at 11.58.Investors Assess Changes Made to Tax BillEarly Saturday, U.S. Senate Republicans passed the much awaited tax Bill after they won a vote 51 to 49 to pass the tax overhaul bill in the Senate. According to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, corporate tax rate will be reduced to 20% from 35%, while companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings.However, this Bill included a last-minute amendment which does not repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax or AMT, a proposal which was part of the draft legislation. Such an amendment places the Senate’s Tax Bill at loggerheads with the Republican Bill because members of the GOP want this facet removed in the final legislation.Economists have stated that if AMT is included in the final version of the Bill, it would weigh heavily on corporate earnings and tax reforms would not turn not to be beneficial for large-cap corporations, the likes of which include big tech companies. Investors contemplated the effects of such a change and this led to broad based losses for the markets.S&P 500 Posts its First Three-Day Streak of LossesThe S&P 500 declined for the third straight day, posting its first three-session decline since August. The S&P 500 lost 9.9 points to end in the red after suffering broad-based losses in intraday trade. Of its 11 major sectors, 10 ended in negative territory with utilities leading the decliners. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) declined 1.3%.Tech shares rebounded after suffering losses on Monday. Tech sector eventually turned out to be the only segment in the S&P 500 to finish with gains. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) increased a meager 0.03%.How Did the Dow and Nasdaq Perform?The Dow declined 109.41 points to pare earlier gains and ended in negative territory on Tuesday after suffering broad based losses. Shares of Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) declined 2.7% following reports from CNBC's David Faber that the company was in talks to buy some key assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). This was the biggest drag on the Dow. Meanwhile, Nasdaq shed 13.2 points on Tuesday to also post a three-day decline. Most of the tech-heavy index’s losses were broad based. Earlier in the session, Nasdaq treaded 0.6% higher.Economic DataOn the economic data front, the ISM Service Index for November came in at 57.4%, lower than the consensus estimate of 59.1%. The reading also came in lower than the 60.1% registered for October, a 12-year high. The new orders index dipped to 58.7%, production declined to 57% and employment slipped to 55.3%.Meanwhile, U.S. trade deficit surged 8.6% to $48.7 billion, a nine-month high. The reading came in higher than the consensus estimate of $46.4 billion.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBrown-Forman Jumps on Q2 Earnings Beat & Raised ViewBrown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) delivered robust second-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates.

1524,FOXA,"Welcome to the ninth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business of Major League Soccer ahead of Saturday’s championship matchup between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.The MLS has grown in both size and stature in recent years. Just last week, the MLS announced four cities—Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, and Sacramento—as finalists for two new expansion franchises, with a whopping $150 million price tag attached.On top of that, the league’s TV ratings and attendance numbers have climbed in 2017. Team valuations also continue to rise, as notable owners from the NFL and NBA, such as Robert Kraft and Paul Allen, help inspire other billionaires to get in on the growth of MLS.The league’s TV partners—Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Univision, and others—broadcasted more games than ever before, many in new primetime spots on flagship channels.Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is firmly committed to MLS and growing the sport of soccer in the U.S. The German sportswear giant keeps on pouring money into the league through jersey deals and youth development.MLS is also a corporate sponsors dream, given the ability to advertise directly on team jerseys. This is something Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and many others have embraced. Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also all current MLS partners and sponsors.Still, despite all of these positive signs and real growth, many people around the U.S. question the current and long-term viability of the relatively young MLS.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1525,FOXA,"It has been a tale of two very different indexes so far on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged higher on the back of the Senate’s tax reform deal, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped.The Dow’s rally today is being supported by continued strength in the financial sector. Index component JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% in morning trading, touching a new all-time high in the process.Meanwhile, investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most heavily-weighted members of the index, was up about 1.5% on Wednesday morning. Other notable Dow stocks in the green include American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report).Shares of Disney gained as much as 6% in morning hours after reports of reignited buyout talks between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) surfaced. According to the latest batch of rumors, Disney has started talking to Fox about purchasing some of its assets again, with a renewed focus on its fellow media giant’s TV and movie studios (also read: Why Shares of Disney, Fox & Comcast Surged Today).Led by these strong gains, the Dow gained about 1% in Wednesday morning trading, touching an intraday high of 24,534.04 in the process. On the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dove as much as 0.5% to reach an intraday low of 6,798.48.The Nasdaq’s sluggishness comes as investors continue to transition away from the technology sector, which has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017.More specifically, it looks like the red-hot semiconductor industry is starting to cool off, as shares of companies like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) have all dropped significantly over the past few trading periods.Before this selloff, the Nasdaq had soared about 30% on the year, eventually settling at a new all-time high in late November. That run-up was inspired by another strong earnings report season, but now it appears that many investors are cashing out of the sector—with strong profits from this year’s rally.Additionally, the tech sector is still viewed as a high-volatility area by many investors, and recent geopolitical news may be forcing people towards more “safe and sound” options. Despite sector-wide earnings and revenue growth, Wall Street is quick to jump out of volatile areas when the threat of crisis looms—and it is probably fair to say that North Korea’s recent missile testing has caused that threat to rise.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1526,FOXA,"Shares of the Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) soared on Monday morning after reports of reignited buyout talks between Disney and its fellow media giant surfaced.The Wall Street Journal first reported that Disney reentered negotiations with Fox in order to purchase some of the company’s biggest assets over the weekend. According to people familiar with the negotiations, Disney’s focus is on the company’s TV and movie studio.The parent company of the struggling ESPN has also honed in on some of Fox’s U.S. cable networks, as well as international media outlets—such as U.K. TV powerhouse Sky PLC (SKYAY  -  Free Report), of which FOXA owns roughly 40%.Left out of any possible deal between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox are the main Fox broadcast network, Fox News, and its sports network, FS1.Talks between the two media powers started a few weeks ago. However, a deal to purchase some of Fox’s most notable assets could not be reached as the two sides were said to have been unable to agree on a price.According to the Journal, Twenty-First Century Fox owner Rupert Murdoch and his family expect to make a decision on if they will go after a deal to sell assets by the end of the year. Murdoch and his family hold 39% of Twenty-First Century Fox’s voting shares.Shares of FOXA climbed over 4% on Monday to hit a new 52-week intraday trading high of $33.60 per share. Disney saw its stock price pop nearly 6% to touch $111.32 per share.Before today’s gains, shares of Twenty-First Century Fox had climbed nearly 15% in 2017, while Disney stock was up only 1% since the start of the year.The discussion between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox comes during changing times in the media landscape. The rise of streaming and cord cutting has forced a lot of shakeups throughout the industry, and could possibly lead to more mergers and buyouts.Shares of Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) also surged 4.41% on Monday as the internet and media giant is also reportedly linked to a possible Twenty-First Century Fox deal. On top of that, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) and Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report) are said to be in the running for some of FOXA’s TV assets.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1527,FOXA,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has told content producers that it plans to spend $1 billion on original programming over the next year to possibly kick-start its own video streaming service.According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple plans to acquire and produce 10 new shows. At the moment, Apple produces two shows, Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, which are available on the company’s music streaming service. The new shows produced by Apple would also appear on Apple Music, or could be a part of a new, video-only service.The $1 billion budget will be in the hands of Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. The previous co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television were hired this past June to take over all TV programming for Apple.Erlicht and Van Amburg have begun meeting with Hollywood agents to find shows the company could acquire. They have also hired former WGN America (TRCO  -  Free Report) President Matt Cherniss to oversee programming development.If Apple launches a video streaming service, it is entering a competitive field. Already, there is Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report); Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Video; Hulu, which is owned by Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner ; Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV; and Time Warner’s HBO, which produces the popular Game of Thrones, and has its own popular, standalone streaming service, HBONow.Not to mention, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), and AT&T (T  -  Free Report) are all looking to debut video streaming services as well.In comparison to the budgets of these other companies, $1 billion matches the amount spent by Amazon when it joined the video streaming field in 2013. However, Apple will need to expand its budget in the coming years to be competitive. Last year, HBO spent $2 billion on original programming, while Netflix is on track to spend about $7 billion in 2018.Investors are reacting positively to the news, with shares of Apple rising 0.35% in morning trading on Wednesday.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1528,FOXA,"On Monday, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, has announced that it has gained two new high-profile customers, popular premium TV service Hulu and credit scoring platform FICO, part of Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO  -  Free Report).Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), and cable giant Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will use AWS to run its live TV service, which officially launched in May. Hulu chose Amazon’s cloud platform over others given its “reliable and secure infrastructure,” and believes it will offer a “great viewer experience, even in times of rapid spikes in viewership and traffic.”""Leaders in media and entertainment like Hulu are looking for more efficient ways to build scalable streaming and OTT solutions,"" said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. ""AWS's unmatched scalability and reliability allow Hulu to continue to innovate and break new ground…without having to spend millions of dollars and thousands of person hours building and managing data centers.""AWS is now behind three major streaming platforms that include Amazon’s Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) along with Hulu. Netflix is a longtime AWS customer, and the company uses the cloud computing service to analyze billions of messages across more than 100,000 application instances in real time every day. Other media services that utilize AWS include BBC, C-SPAN, Lionsgate (LGF.A  -  Free Report), Newsweek, PBS, Soundcloud, Spotify, and Time Inc. , among others.In a separate announcement, Amazon said that Fair Isaac, which provides analytic, software, and data management products and services like its FICO credit scoring system, has chosen AWS to be its cloud provider.FICO said that it has “migrated” many of its core applications, including myFICO.com and its flagship analytics platform, over to AWS, and has plans to move even more applications throughout the next three years. Similar to Hulu, FICO said it chose AWS because of its cloud capability strength, like serverless computing, analytics, containers, and machine learning.The company also said it will be better positioned to serve 95% of the biggest financial institutions in the United States with AWS, all of whom rely on FICO’s high-volume software.""When we started to plan for our digital transformation, time to value, velocity, scalability, cost control and security were our top priorities. AWS's experience with other companies in highly regulated industries, combined with its industry leading technology, made AWS the obvious choice for FICO,"" said Jeet Kaul, VP Engineering at FICO.Today, shares of Amazon closed the day up 1.58% to $983.30 per share, while FICO stock closed up 2.36% to $140.27 per share.5 Trades That Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today, Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

However, News and Information Services, Book Publishing and Cable Network Programming segments hurt the results. The company has been concentrating on cost cutting and augmenting digital subscriber base to offset sluggish print advertising demand.News Corporation registered adjusted earnings of 11 cents a share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and improved by a penny from the year-ago quarter. Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal reported net loss from continuing operations of 74 cents a share compared with earnings of 16 cents posted in the prior-year period.News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), stated that its total revenue for the reported quarter was $2,080 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,111 million. The company’s adjusted revenue (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) came in at $2,048 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteBoth advertising and circulation and subscription revenues declined 8% to $737 million and $636 million, respectively. Consumer revenues fell 6% to $390 million, while revenues from real estate inched up 1% to $171 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues remained flat at $146 million.News Corporation is in a transitional phase, looking to diversify revenue streams, along with expanding digital properties through product launches and accretive acquisitions. These have helped the stock to gain 19.3% so far in the year compared with the industry’s growth of 1.8%.Segmental PerformanceRevenue from the News and Information Services segment declined 10% year over year to $1,281 million in the reported quarter. Advertising revenue tumbled 12% to $650 million due to sluggishness in the print advertising market, reduced in-store product revenue at News America Marketing and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. This was partly offset by contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group.Circulation and subscription revenue decrease 9% to $511 million on account of adverse foreign currency fluctuations and fall in print volume. Digital revenue accounted for 26% of segment revenue in the quarter under review compared with 23% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA plunged 38% during the quarter to $100 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenue of $407 million, down 6% from the prior-year period owing to adverse foreign currency fluctuations and fall in sales at the Children’s division. Digital sales constituted 20% of Consumer revenue compared with 19% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA plummeted 20% to $40 million.Revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment advanced 10% year over year to $251 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group Limited (up 7%) and Move (up 10%). However, the growth was partly offset by the divestiture of REA Group’s European business and the sale of Move’s TigerLead product. Adjusted EBITDA soared 67% to $87 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $140 million, down 5% on account of the additional week in the prior year and decline in affiliate revenue at FOX SPORTS Australia. This was partly mitigated by the buyout of Australian News Channel and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted EBITDA rose 4% to $24 million.Other Financial AspectsNews Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,016 million, borrowings of $276 million and shareholders’ equity of 10,789 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $284 million.Capital expenditures of $256 million were incurred during fiscal 2017, while free cash flow available to the company was $113 million.2 Media Stocks Seeking Your AttentionBetter-ranked stocks worth considering include Gray Television, Inc.

1530,FOXA,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 9. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 14.9%.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 34 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 24%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents witnessed in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,734 million compared with $6,646 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterRobust affiliate fees at the company’s broadcast and cable-television divisions are anticipated to drive the revenues higher. In the third quarter, Cable Network Programming revenues increased 2.1% on the back of robust affiliate revenues growth, after increasing 10% and 7.1% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Affiliate fees are the dominant source of revenue for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenue.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming costs have increased 6.3% to $7,687 million. The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs. We believe that an increase in expenses, due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the margins and affect the bottom line in the coming quarters.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

1531,FOXA,"Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC  -  Free Report) tanked on Wednesday after the movie theater chain suggested bad box office numbers will lead to weak second-quarter earnings, and this word of warning brought the rest of the movie industry lower as well.AMC plummeted 26% on Wednesday, hitting a new all-time low in the process. The movie theater chain’s new full-year 2017 guidance projects a net loss of $150 million to $125 million, which would equal a loss per diluted share of $1.17 to $0.97. AMC is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).What has the rest of the movie industry so scared is the fact that the company cited rough box office numbers as a big reason for the new, less-than stellar guidance. AMC reported that U.S. box office revenue dropped 4.4% year-over-year, while overall North American box office revenue fell 3.3%.Shares of the biggest movie theater chains and moving making giants dropped on the back of the news.Movie Theater Industry After missing Zacks Consensus Estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenues last week, shares of Regal Entertainment  dipped. Today, the movie theater chain’s stock fell 4.64% and hit its 52-week intraday low at $18 per share. Regal Entertainment is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Imax (IMAX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter earnings that beat our estimates, but its earnings actually fell 11.11% year-over-year. The company missed revenue expectations, with overall theater business revenue down 15.76% from the year-ago period.IMAX plummeted 11% on Wednesday, hitting a new 52-week intraday trading low at $19.33 per share. Imax is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and scored a “D” for Value and an “F” for Momentum in our Style Score system.Cinemark (CNK  -  Free Report), which is set to report its second-quarter earning on Friday, fell 5.72% to hover just above its 52-week low. Cinemark is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Movie Maker StocksThe Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Sony  both fell over 2%. Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), which owns 20th Century Fox Studios, and Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), which owns Universal Pictures, both dipped around 1%.Viacom , owner of Paramount Pictures, fell 3.64%, just one day before it reports its third-quarter earnings. Time Warner,  which owns Warner Bros, seemed to be immune to the downturn and saw a marginal gain to rest less than $1 below its 52-week high.Overall, however, the PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio ETF (PBS  -  Free Report), which tracks the entertainment world, dropped 2.03%.Alarming Industry Trends According to a Motion Picture Association of America report, 2016 global box office receipts totaled $38.6 billion, which marked a 1% increase year-over-year. In the U.S. and Canada, the figured climbed 2% to a total of $11.4 billion. However, international box office revenue declined for the first time in over a decade.International markets accounted for almost 71% of the global box office in 2016, up from 63% ten years ago. The biggest reason for the fall off overseas was China’s sudden pullback after a period of sustained growth.Overall admissions totaled 1.32 billion, which was down from 1.4 billion a decade ago. The strength of the 2016 box office was boosted by several massive movies, as the top-20 films accounted for nearly 50% of the 2016 domestic box office.Based on the figures in the MPAA annual report, the number of frequent moviegoers—who go to the movies once a month or more and account for 48% of domestic ticket sales—dropped significantly from 2012. For example, in 2012, there were 9.9 million frequent moviegoers in the 25 to 39 age group. In 2016, there were just 8 million.Any Positives?The average cost of a movie ticket in North America hit a record high of $8.95 in the second quarter of 2017. High ticket prices help keep overall box office sales up, and in terms of entrainment outside of the home, movies are very competitively priced—adjusted for inflation; going to the movies is cheaper than it was in 1977.Compared to going to a major American sporting event, movie tickets are actually affordable. It cost $34.60 for a family of four to go to the movies in 2016. Attending an NFL game ran $371.92, while going to a ballpark cost $124.00 on average.On top of this, movie theater chains are now slowly adding adult beverages and better food options in an effort to attract more customers.However, movie studios will need to address the streaming and on-demand problem that has helped bring down the total number of people going to theaters. As box office numbers fell last quarter, Netflix added 5.2 Million new users.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

1534,FOXA,"Disney (DIS) continued its fairytale ride at the box office with back-to-back success of Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War. In fact, the success provided a huge boost to the media giant’s strategy of monetizing franchises from acquired studios like Marvel and Lucasflim. This is evident from the recent box office collections.Per data from Box Office Mojo, Black Panther currently tops the U.S. box-office gross collection list with $696.7 million trailed only by Avengers: Infinity War which has garnered $558.7 million.The dominance of these two movies was evident from the fact that the third movie in the list — Paramount’s A Quiet Place — has only collected $171 million to date. Interestingly, Disney’s stand-alone film A Wrinkle in Time didn’t feature in the top #5 with a weak domestic gross collection of $97 million.Disney is now banking on its blockbuster franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (“MCU”), The Incredibles, Star Wars, Toy Story and Frozen to face the onslaught of content from streaming services like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu, HBO, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Facebook. The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus | The Walt Disney Company Quote Content Strength Drives Streaming Services DemandRobust demand for original content has been a major growth driver for these streaming services in recent times. The companies are spending huge to produce as well as acquire content that are enticing subscribers.Per data from MoffettNathanson, Netflix spent $6.3 billion on original and acquired content in 2017, higher than Amazon and Hulu, who spent $4.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Moreover, Netflix was not far behind Disney which spent $7.8 billion on non-sports programming. New entrants like Apple and Facebook spent $1 billion each.Netflix is now set to release 86 original movies in 2018 as compared with 61 released in 2017. The company has a whopping budget of $8 billion, 85% of which is anticipated to be spent on original content this year.Although Hulu is expected spend lesser than Netflix on original content, it has an enviable content pipeline supported by its parents — Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) NBCUniversal, Disney’s ABC, 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) as well as HBO and CNN owner Time Warner, which has a minority share.Moreover, Apple has reportedly outspent Facebook and YouTube to acquire original programming. The company is now expected to launch its original shows as early as March 2019.Amazon is also expected to spend $5 billion this year on original content per JPMorgan. The company is making all efforts to boost its digital media sales and attract new viewers by adding varied series and movies to its content lineup, and making Prime Video more enticing.Strong Movie Lineup Shielding DisneyHowever, we believe Disney is not far behind in terms of content strength primarily due to its blockbuster franchises like Marvel and Star Wars.The company has an impressive line-up of big budget movies slated to be released over the next 18 months. The portfolio include movies involving MCU characters like Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel (2019), and Avengers 4 (2019). The Walt Disney Company Revenue (TTM) The Walt Disney Company Revenue (TTM) | The Walt Disney Company Quote Notably per Disney, the MCU “by far the most lucrative box office franchise of all time.” To date, the 19 movies in the MCU have together grossed more than $16 billion.Apart from MCU, Disney is also set to release The Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 along with Star Wars: Episode IX. The company is also set to release Solo: A Star Wars Story on May 23.The solid content pipeline is also expected to boost Disney’s Consumer Products division as demand for merchandise associated with superhit movies usually skyrockets as was experienced in case of Frozen.Disney also plans to add Marvel related content for its new standalone streaming service that is set to launch in late 2019. The termination of distribution agreement with Netflix will enable it to offer rich content exclusively from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm.Disney has already launched ESPN+ that is offering tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis and college sports for $4.99 per month. The company recently announced the acquisition of UFC events rights starting in 2019 for five years. This further expands content, which is likely to attract more subscribers in the long haul.Zacks RankCurrently, Disney carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1535,FOXA,"Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) recent announcement to invest around 85% of total spending in original content shows the company’s intent to maintain its top spot in the online video streaming market.Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos disclosed at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit that the company is set to release 470 originals by 2018, which will take the total count for the year to nearly 1,000.Netflix continues to dominate the streaming market based on its ever-expanding content portfolio, well supported by a whopping budget. The company is expected to spend $8 billion in 2018, which is anticipated to increase further to $12.2 billion in 2020.The solid budget helps the company fight intensifying competition in the streaming market from the likes of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), HBO, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime, Comcast and Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report).Notably, Netflix has returned an astounding 71.2% in the year-to-date period compared with the S&P 500’s gain of just 2%. In comparison, Amazon and Apple shares have returned 37% and 11.2%, respectively while Disney has lost 4.7%.   Content is Still the KingThe attractiveness of Netflix’s diverse content portfolio is evident from the fact that subscriber addition remained unaffected despite a hike in subscription prices. The company added 7.41 million subscribers in the last quarter, which surpassed expectations of 6.35 million.Moreover, Netflix’s growing popularity among teenagers is evident from the recently released Piper Jaffray’s 35th semi-annual Taking Stock with Teens survey.Per the survey, Netflix’s dominance in video consumption is increasing and is currently the most preferred platform among teens. Reportedly, the respondents spent 39% of their time watching Netflix, up 2% from the survey of 2017 fall while competitors, namely Alphabet’s YouTube, Amazon and Hulu had 30%, 3% and 5% viewership, respectively.Moreover, investment in original content is one of the major factors that helped the company in gaining a competitive edge.Per data from MoffettNathanson, Netflix spent $6.3 billion on original and acquired content in 2017, higher than Amazon and Hulu, who spent $4.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, while new entrants in the video streaming space like Apple and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) spent $1 billion each. Moreover, it was also not much behind Disney, which spent $7.8 billion on non-sports programming.The company’s $8 billion budget for content this year has also unnerved traditional TV and film content providers like Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and HBO’s owner Time Warner .Netflix, Inc.

QuoteContent War IntensifiesNetflix enjoys a first-mover advantage in the streaming market and its solid original programming portfolio is a major differentiator. The company has gained an as its entire focus is on building its content portfolio, while rivals like Amazon, Apple and Disney have to focus on diverse products.However, competition in the promising online video streaming is heating up with all the players offering highly engaging content.Amazon’s Prime business is performing exceptionally well, as evident from its more than 100 million members as of Apr 18. The company notes that the addition and retention of Prime members is mainly driven by Prime Video. JPMorgan expects the company to spend $5 billion this year on content.Apple is gearing up to become a major producer of original content. The company is likely to launch a streaming service in 2018, which is expected to provide a significant boost to the Services business. Apple has also made key appointments to foray into original television programming. The company is also developing series starring Oscar winning actors.Further, Disney’s acquisition of certain 21st Century Fox assets strengthens its over-the-top streaming service, which is likely to be launched in 2019. The termination of the distribution agreement with Netflix will enable it to offer rich content exclusively from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. The company has already launched ESPN+ that is offering sports tournaments (which Netflix does not currently). This further expands content, which is likely to attract more subscribers in the long haul.Nonetheless, such enormous spending can dent Netflix’s profitability in the near term. However, we believe that the company’s expanding content portfolio will rapidly drive subscriber growth that will further boost the stock in the rest of 2018.Zacks RankCurrently, Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1536,FOXA,"Rupert Murdoch-controlled News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) delivered sixth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third successive quarter. Results gained from sturdy performance at the Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Cable Network Programming segments.However, sluggish print advertising demand still remains a concern. Nevertheless, the company is concentrating on cost cutting, expanding digital offerings with greater emphasis on real estate services to mitigate the impact of the same. Management also highlighted that from the final quarter of fiscal 2018, the combination of digital real estate services and pay-TV operations will represent more than half of profits and propel recurring subscription-based revenues considerably.News Corporation also hinted about the consolidation of Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia which is likely to result in circulation and subscription revenues to emerge as one of the prominent revenue streams for the company. This will shield it from volatility in the advertising market. The new segment — Subscription Video Services — formed due to consolidation will also incorporate Australian news channel operator, Sky News.Notably, shares of the company have gained 9% in the past six months but have underperformed the industry’s rally of 21%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteQ3 HighlightsNews Corporation delivered adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share that came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined 14% from the year-ago quarter.Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal reported quarterly loss of $1.94 per share that widened from a loss of one cent in the prior-year period on account of non-cash write-downs related to Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia and non-cash impairment charge at News America Marketing.Moreover, News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), stated that total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $2,093 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,975 million as well. Adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) of $2,008 million, improved 2% year over year.While advertising revenues declined 3% to $687 million, circulation and subscription revenues increased 7% to $659 million. Consumer revenues also rose 6% to $381 million, while revenues from real estate were up 24% to $208 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues improved 23% to $158 million.Total segment EBITDA was $182 million for the quarter under review, reflecting a decline of 15% from the prior-year period.Segment DetailsRevenues from the News and Information Services segment jumped 2% over year to $1,286 million in the reported quarter. At News UK and Dow Jones, revenues increased 10% and 4%, respectively. However, at News America Marketing and News Corp Australia, the metric decreased 5% and 3%, respectively. Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues fell 3% year over year due to softness in the print advertising market, primarily in Australia and the United States, and lower revenues at News America Marketing. The decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions also impacted the results. These were somewhat mitigated by modest improvement in digital advertising revenues at News Corp Australia and Dow Jones as well as marginal growth in advertising revenues at News UK. Foreign currency fluctuations also acted as a tailwind. Definitely, the rate of decline in advertising revenues have decelerated from 6% reported in the second quarter.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 7% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones — which witnessed nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues — persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business. Rise in cover and subscription price, and favorable currency impact also aided revenue growth. These were partly offset by fall in newsstand volume at News UK.In the quarter under review, digital revenues accounted for 29% of segment revenues compared with 24% in the year-ago period. Segment EBITDA plunged 31% to $85 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $398 million, up 6% from the prior-year period. Digital sales, which constituted 22% of Consumer revenues, rose 5% from the prior-year quarter owing to increase in downloadable audio book sales. The segment’s adjusted revenues rose 4% in the quarter. Segment EBITDA surged 16% to $43 million.Revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment advanced 27% year over year to $279 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group (up 35% to $158 million) and Move (up 15% to $115 million). Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues were up 18%. Segment EBITDA surged 17% to $88 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $129 million, up 6% on account of rise in affiliate revenues at FOX SPORTS Australia and Australian News Channel and favorable currency fluctuations. The segment’s adjusted revenues also grew 2% in the quarter. However, segment EBITDA plummeted 53% to $16 million.Other Financial AspectsNews Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,112 million, borrowings of $184 million and shareholders’ equity of $9,695 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $296 million.Capital expenditures of $200 million were incurred in the nine months of fiscal 2018, while free cash flow available to the company was $184 million.OutlookManagement stated that advertising trends so far in the fourth quarter are mostly in line with the third quarter. Moreover, the company anticipates marketing costs at Dow Jones to increase marginally on account of driving digital paid subscribers.The company has entered into a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien, which is likely to be accretive in the fourth quarter. The company expects to generate more than $20 million additional revenues.News Corporation expects sturdy revenue growth at REA.2 Stocks Seeking Your AttentionThe New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 31.6% in the trailing four quarters.

1537,FOXA,"Deal Frenzy in EntertainmentA lot of attention has been paid of late to the battle developing between the Walt Disney Corporation (DIS  -  Free Report) and cable giant Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report).  Disney has made an all-stock bid of approximately $52B for a significant portion of the assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and is currently working on obtaining regulatory and shareholder approval.Though there has been no official announcement yet, the word on the street is that Comcast is scrambling to arrange financing for an all cash bid of $60B.  In the event of competing bids, the decision would fall to Fox Shareholders.  Rupert Murdoch owns 17% of those shares and has expressed a preference for the Disney deal, even though it carries a lower nominal price.It’s also anticipated that in the event of a bidding war, Comcast could sweeten the pot by combining it with the purchase of U.K. TV provider SKY, which would likely push the value of the deal toward $100B.Last year, Disney announced its intention to pull its content from Netflix (NLFX) in order to start its own streaming video service as a Netflix competitor.  Hunger for ContentThe most important commodity for streaming video providers is content.  They can choose to purchase finished productions, engage in licensing deals with the owners of content or produce their own original movies and shows.  Netflix engages in a combination of all three.  It’s easy to see how the 21st Century Fox acquisition would aid Disney in its aspirations to compete in the streaming market.Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) just put up a great quarter and looks poised to continue the growth with its recent acquisition of Scripps Network Interactive, adding to its production of over 8000 hours per year of original programming. Discovery expects the Scripps deal to add to its demographic reach and international appeal, both of which increase the value of its offerings to advertisers.Discovery’s $2.86B in revenues in the quarter topped Q1 2017 results by 64%, and net earnings of $0.53/share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45/share.  Four recent analyst upward revisions now have expected 2018 earnings at $2.77/share, up from $2.48/share 60 days ago.  Thanks to the upward revisions, Discovery is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Discovery currently trades at a P/E Ratio of 8.2X, considerably lower than the Broadcasting/Radio-TV sub-industry average of 29X.Speculating on future takeovers is a dicey business because the world and business conditions change quickly, but in an era of consolidation in the entertainment business, it’s easy to see how Discovery’s earnings potential, vast content library and extremely low valuation would be attractive to either a huge entertainment company starting its own streaming service or a Cable TV conglomerate that’s continually adding to its portfolio. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.  Click for details >>

1538,FOXA,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) popped on Thursday to inch closer to their 52-week high as investors continue to assess the social media company’s newly brighten outlook. With that said, let’s take a look at why Twitter stock is currently a strong buy.Twitter reported GAAP profitability in the first quarter, after doing so for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2017. This alone helps show investors that Twitter is slowly becoming a legitimate money maker and might be shedding its post-hype negativity. Growth InitiativesTwitter’s user base pales in comparison to Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and is much closer to Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). But company grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base popped by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year. But investors should understand that every user counts, especially as it grows its advertising revenue.The company’s AD revenues, which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s total Q1 revenue, climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%, lifted by growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands it live video reach.One metric that helps demonstrate live video’s power and appeal to content producers and advertisers is ad engagements. Twitter saw this key figure skyrocket nearly 70% in the first quarter, while its cost per engagement dropped 28% from the year-ago quarter. Video also made up more than half of Twitter’s total advertising revenues and was the company’s fastest-growing ad segment.Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1, with roughly 80% reaching a global audience. The company also announced that it signed more than 30 new video deals in the first quarter, which includes live-streaming rights, highlights, as well as VOD partnerships.The company locked down new deals with Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), MLB, MLS, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more well-known outlets. This streaming video push should help Twitter expand both its top and bottom lines, especially as people consume more and more content from their mobile devices.More Fundamentals & OutlookTwitter’s live video push and its bottom line growth have made its stock look far more reasonably priced. Twitter is now trading at 43.79x earnings, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average P/E of 59.92x. Shares of Twitter also currently sit roughly 10% below their 52-week high, despite the company’s strong first quarter and recent surge. This means now might be a great time to buy Twitter stock before it faces the added burden of having to break into a new range.With that said, Twitter could easily fly by its 52-week high as momentum mounts, considering that the company is expected to see its earnings and revenues continue to climb. Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.Twitter’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket over 112% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for its full-year. This means that analysts covering the stock have recently become more positive about the company’s bottom line expansion in 2018.Bottom LineFor years, Twitter has been a fantastic platform to share instant news. But even as it grew into a resource that is currently used by nearly every major company, public entity, and news outlet, Twitter struggled to make money. Now, Twitter finally looks like it might have hit its stride with live video—which commands much more advertising dollars than nearly all other digital mediums.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an A grade for Value and a B for Momentum in our Style Scores system. Furthermore, on top of its near-term bottom line expansion, Twitter is projected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 23.1% over the next three to five years.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1545,FOXA,"Media behemoth – The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) – posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Despite reporting earnings beat, the company’s shares declined nearly 4% in after-hour trading session yesterday as the company’s top-line performance hurt investor sentiment, which missed the Zacks Consensus estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter. In fact, the stock has declined 2.5% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s dip of 1.1%.The company’s earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.58 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 but decreased 2.5% year over year. Meanwhile, revenues came in at $14,238 million, almost flat year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,442 million. The year-over-year decline in both top and bottom line were primarily impacted by higher programming costs at ESPN as this is the first year of fresh NBA contract and sharp decline in Studios Entertainment revenues.The company’s total operating income came in at $4,011 million during the quarter, down 10% year over year. The downside was due to 22% and 17% decline in operating income from Media Network, and Studio Entertainment, respectively. Disney to Terminate Netflix PartnershipConcurrently, Disney stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019. Instead, the company will have its own streaming services – one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers.  Disney will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Meanwhile, through the fresh Disney-branded service subscribers can view both Disney’s and Pixar’s latest live action and animated movies, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate. Movies like Toy Story 4, the sequel to Frozen and The Lion King will also be streamed.Disney to Acquire Majority Stake in BAMTechIn an effort to attract online viewers, the company which had earlier acquired 33% stake in video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech announced its intention to acquire another 42% stake in the firm. Per the agreement, the company will have shell out $1.58 billion to buy another 42% stake in BAMTech.In the past few quarters Disney’s ESPN has been a hot topic in the media industry and investors are closely monitoring the performance of ESPN. Identical to performances in the past few quarters, ESPN has disappointed investors in the third quarter again. Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN continues to hamper the company’s results. Most of the media companies are failing to cope with ""cord cutting"" as consumers are unwilling to pay for large bundles of channels.ESPN has sealed a number of deals with new platform owners, mostly over-the-top. These deals have started to give positive results and are also increasing the number of subscribers. Moreover, the company has inked a deal with Hulu and another entity, and also is in discussion with others. The company had earlier stated that mobile apps are going to play an important role in the future of media and ESPN is rightly on the way of taking the advantage of the trend with wide range of apps. Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteSegment DetailsThe Media Networks segment’s revenues were down 1% to $5,866 million, primarily due 3% decrease in Cable Networks revenues to $4,086 million. However, broadcasting revenues rose 4% year over year to $1,780 million.The segment’s operating income came in at $1,842 million, down 22% year over year. Cable Networks saw 23% drop in operating income to $1,462 million, while the Broadcasting segment reported a 22% slump in operating income to $253 million. Operating income from equity in the income of investees plunged 18% to $127 million. Sharp decline in Cable Networks operating income was due to dismal performance of ESPN. Weaker results at ESPN were mostly due to increase in programming cost in comparison with the preceding year, fall in advertising revenues. Further, it was affected by severance and contract termination expenses which overshadowed the affiliate revenues growth. Decrease in advertising revenues were chiefly due to decline in average viewership. Meanwhile, growth in affiliate revenues was driven by rise in contractual rate, which mitigated the fall in subscribers.Parks and Resorts revenues came in at $4,894 million, up 12% from the year-ago period. The segment’s operating income climbed 18% to $1,168 million, backed by growth at the company’s international operations which was due to robust performance of Shanghai Disney Resort and Disneyland Paris. Rise in guest spending and attendance were the main reasons behind growth in operating income at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, operating income at the company’s domestic operations was flat year over year as rise in expenses were offset by higher guest spending and volumes. Both attendance and per capita spending at the company’s domestic park increased 8% and 2%, respectively during the quarter.Further, the segment results were also driven by timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in the third quarter compared with second quarter in the previous year. The company is also satisfied with the Shanghai Disney, which completed its first full year of operations in June. It is also anticipated to be modestly profitable in this fiscal year.The Studio segment generated revenues of $2,393 million, down 16% year over year. Moreover, operating income dropped 17% to $639 million. Sharp decline in operating income was due to dismal performance in theatrical as well as home entertainment distribution, which offset growth at TV/SVOD distribution, home entertainment and decline in film cost impairments. Decrease in theatrical distribution results were due to better performance of the company’s releases in the prior year-quarter compared with this quarter. During the third quarter, the company’s major releases included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Cars 3, while in the year-ago quarter it released Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Alice Through the Looking Glass.However, analysts believe that the coming two years will be the most fruitful for Disney. The studio is all set to continue with its success story beyond Star Wars, Zootopia and Beauty and the Beast as it boasts of an impressive lineup of big budget movies up to 2018.Movies which are lined up for 2017 include Thor: Ragnarok, Coco and last but not the least, one of the most awaited releases of the year Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi.  Moreover, the success of its movies will mean great business for its Consumer Products division as demand for the merchandise associated with successful movies usually skyrocket. In 2018, the company is expected to release Black Panther, A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp.Consumer Products & Interactive Media division saw 5% decrease in revenues to $1,085 million. However, the units’ operating income rose 12% to $362 million. The rise in operating income was mainly due to improvement at the games and merchandise licensing business.Other Financial DetailsDisney, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) generated free cash flow of $3,328 million during the reported quarter, up 33% year over year. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,336 million, borrowings of $18,849 million and shareholder’s equity of $42,531 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $3,520 million.During the quarter, the company bought back nearly 22.3 million shares for $2.4 billion.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Disney carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which is subject to change following the earnings announcement.

1546,FOXA,"Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) acquired Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion in 2009. At the time, many worried that the deal would both harm Marvel’s beloved characters and hurt Disney’s bottom line. Almost a decade later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the biggest movie franchises in history, with over a dozen box office hits and no plans to slow down anytime soon.Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios released the first Iron Man movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., all the way back in May 2008. That same summer Marvel and Universal Pictures released The Incredible Hulk, which actually starred Edward Norton, not Mark Ruffalo.Few could have anticipated that these two movies would spark a multibillion-dollar movie franchise. Then, Disney purchased Marvel Entertainment, and everything changed.With this in mind, let’s take a look at just how much the Marvel movies have grossed at the box office and dive into what’s next from the MCU.Phase One·         Iron Man- $585.2 million·         The Incredible Hulk- $263.2 million·         Iron Man 2- $623.9 million·         Thor- $449.3 million·         Captain America: The First Avenger- $370.6 million·         The Avengers- $1.5 billionPhase Two·         Iron Man 3- $1.2 billion·         Thor: The Dark World- $644.6 million·         Captain America: The Winter Soldier- $714.3 million·         Guardians of the Galaxy- $773.3 million·         Avengers: Age of Ultron- $1.4 billion·         Ant-Man- $519.3 millionPhase Three·         Captain America: Civil War- $1.2 billion·         Doctor Strange- $677.7 million·         Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2- $863.8 million·         Spider-Man: Homecoming- $880.2 million·         Thor: Ragnarok- $854 million·         Black Panther- $1.3 billion·         Avengers: Infinity War- $1.2 billionThe most recent movies, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, are two of the most successful. In fact, Avengers: Infinity War broke domestic and global records on it way to becoming the largest movie opening in history. To date, the 19 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have together grossed more than $16 billion, which makes MCU “by far the most lucrative box office franchise of all time,” according to Disney.Looking Ahead There are currently three new Marvel films set to be released within the next year. The first, Ant-Man and the Wasp, is scheduled to hit theaters on July 6. Meanwhile, Captain Marvel isn’t due out until March 2019, with an untitled Avengers sequel tentatively set for May 2019. At one point not too long ago Disney planned for the final Avengers movie to mark the climax of the franchise after a decade-long run. However, Disney has seen the light and won’t move on from this cash cow just yet. CEO Bob Iger provided some details about his company’s plan to move the franchise forward on Disney’s recent earnings call. “We meet on a regular basis with our Marvel team, and we plotted out Marvel movies that will take us well into the next decade,” Iger said.“We're confident that with the 7,000 some odd characters that are part of the Marvel universe that there's plenty stories and characters to mine from and have some great ideas. I'm guessing that we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.”Disney also touched on its plans to add Marvel related content for its new standalone streaming service that is set to launch in late 2019—as Disney waits for its current Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) contracts to expire. “We're producing right now content for it, original content that is Pixar branded, Marvel branded, Star Wars branded and Disney branded,” Iger said.Marvel fans should be excited to see what Disney’s new streaming service has to offer, and how much content will live there. But it is very reasonable to assume that nearly all of the Marvel movies and any new shows will be available in order to entice customers as Disney fights against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other streaming powers. Iger also made it clear that Disney will launch its streaming service even if the Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) deal doesn’t go through.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1547,FOXA,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 49 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and declined 5 cents from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $7.42 billion came ahead of the consensus mark of $7.31 billion but declined 2% from the year-ago quarter. This was due to the absence of Television advertisements for Super Bowl LI, which had largely benefited the company in the prior year quarter. However, increase in affiliate revenues at the Cable Network Programming was a positive.Quarter DetailsSegment wise, Cable Network Programming revenues (59.6% of total revenues) jumped 9.8% to $4.42 billion on the back of robust affiliate, syndication as well as advertising revenue growth.Filmed Entertainment revenues (30.2%) were down 0.6% to $2.24 billion while Television segment net revenues (15.5%) decreased 32% to $1.15 billion, both on a year-over-year basis.On the basis of component, affiliate revenues (47.3%) increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to $3.51 billion. At domestic cable channels, affiliate revenues grew 10% owing to a rise in contractual rate across all domestic brands. Affiliate revenues for international cable channels advanced 14% owing to an increase in rates and subscriber growth at FNG International as well as STAR.Advertising revenues (21.1% of total) declined 26% year over year to $1.642 billion due to the absence of television advertising revenues of Super Bowl, which was broadcast in the year-ago quarter.International advertising revenues for Cable Network Programming declined 1% primarily owing to the shift in timing of cricket matches, which overshadowed the improvement at FNG International. Domestic advertising revenues for cable programming increased 3% year over year primarily due to increase in Fox News pricing.Content revenues (28.9%) increased 3.4% year over year to $2.15 billion.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. QuoteOperating DetailsThe company’s total segment operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) came in at $1.89 billion, down 2.3% year over year. Increase in OBIDA from Cable Network Programming was negated by decline in OIBDA from Television, Film Entertainment and Other, Corporate and Eliminations.As a result, OIBDA margin of 25.5% contracted 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis.OIBDA at Cable Network Programming rose 16.5% to $1.68 billion on higher revenues. The increase was partially offset by 6% rise in expenses due to higher sports and entertainment programming costs. Shift in cricket match timings attributed to lower sports programming costs for STAR India.OIBDA contribution from domestic rose 15% year over year due to increase in contribution from all domestic brands. OIBDA contribution from International cable channels jumped 23% year over year backed by more than double contribution from STAR. However, lower performance at FNG International was a dampener.Filmed Entertainment’s OIBDA slumped 23% to $286 million on account of lower revenues from the television production business. Further, increase in expenses due to the release of FoxNext Games’ mobile game Marvel Strike Force was an overhang.Television segment’s OIBDA plunged 59% to $78 million on account of unfavorable comparison due to Super Bowl. Moreover, decline in broadcast and ratings of National Football League weighed on results.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

1548,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates in second-quarter fiscal 2018, with the credit going largely to the success of Black Panther. Understandably, Black Panther has exceeded expectations proving yet again that the best way to ensure box office success is to take the franchise route.It isn’t only Disney, other big studios have also been banking heavily on the franchise formula over the past few years. Marvel Comics’ characters have enjoyed tremendous popularity over the years and have given huge returns to the makers. But Avengers and others might lose their superpowers one day and the studios will need Plan B to race ahead of tough players like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) that are changing the entire movie landscape.Disney Rides High on Franchise PowerDisney’s adjusted Q2 earnings climbed 23% from the year-ago period to $1.84 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s overall quarterly revenues also popped 9% to $14.55 billion. The media giant in its earnings report said that its results were significantly helped by Black Panther, which fetched more than $1.3 billion from worldwide ticket sales.What Black Panther did for Disney in the last-reported quarter seems to be getting repeated by Avengers: Infinity War in the ongoing quarter, with the film already having grossed $1 billion at the global box office within 11 days of its release. According to Box Office Mojo, it is the 17th Disney film and the sixth Marvel film to cross the $1 billion box office milestone.Understandably, franchise films have been Disney’s elixir for the past few years with the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) all topping the box office. Even Black Panther’s performance to a great extent helped the company’s television business that is suffering from an industry-wide decline in pay-TV viewership. Disney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Franchise Films Boost Other Studios Not only Disney, even Time Warner, Inc.’s  Warner Bros. has franchises like Fantastic Beasts, Lord of the Rings and Matrix, while Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), has the likes of Jurassic Park, The Fast and the Furious and The Mummy.Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of Sony Corporation of America (SNE  -  Free Report), too has been tasting success with franchise films, with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Spider-Man: Homecoming becoming its two highest grossing films in 2017. Moreover, Sony is gearing up for its next Spider-Man film Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse (3D) that releases in December.Warner Bros.’ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is up for release this year, while Godzilla 2 releases in 2019. Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom releases in June, while Fast & Furious 9 and 10 and Jurassic World 3 are again in the pipeline.What’s Next for Studios When Franchise Films Lose Appeal?Needless to say, the franchise chapter may close one day, leaving the studios on the lookout for new growth avenues. On May 8, 2018, Disney said that more Avengers movies could be on their way given the success of Avengers: Infinity War.Although the fourth Avengers film, due for a 2019 release, will be the concluding one, Disney’s CEO Bog Iger said, “Given the popularity of the characters and given the popularity of the franchise, I don't think people should conclude that there will never be another 'Avengers' movie.”Undoubtedly, Disney is exploring the franchise space further. A decade ago, the struggling Marvel Studios had sold the right of all its characters, with Fantastic Four and X-Men going to Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), while Sony got Spider-Man. Later, Disney bought the studio with the remaining characters.Now, Disney is in a position to make films on characters owned by Sony and Fox. In fact, Disney together with Sony last year made Spider-Man: Homecoming and has now used Spider-Man in Avengers: Infinity War. That says a lot about the studios’ plans with the franchise films.Understandably, the reboot formula with a new cast is one easy way for studios to continue with franchise films. If Spider-Man has succeeded in not losing its appeal since 1962, it’s likely the same can be done with the other characters.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

The company saw revenue figures of $7.42 billion, beating our consensus estimate of $7.31 billion.

A preliminary joint proxy statement was filed with the SEC on April 18, 2018, and the deal is expected to be approximately 12 to 18 months from December 13, 2017.

1550,FOXA,"Per several media reports, U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) could disrupt the  Disney-Fox deal inked in December. Per the deal, Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) agreed to sell its entertainment assets to The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) for $52.4 billion.This is especially true given that Comcast is exploring financing options to make a hostile all-cash bid of as much as $60 billion to snap up those assets itself, outbidding Disney’s offer, if the United States regulators approve AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) acquisition of Time Warner  in June.Acquisition of Fox would boost the competitive position of both Comcast and Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) (read: ETFs to Buy on Netflix's Blockbuster Q1 Earnings).Why Comcast Wants to Buy Fox?Lower cable subscriptions in the wake of surging demand for online services have compelled Comcast to look for new avenues of growth. In particular, streaming bundles such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Google's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV pose major threat to Comcast’s cable business. The purchase of Fox could bulk up Comcast’s portfolio of films and TV shows and help in luring more Internet and cable subscribers. It also gives the company a majority stake in Hulu as CMCSA already owns a sizable chunk of it.The deal would add to what Comcast already has within NBCUniversal, which includes channels like Bravo and E!, as well as Universal Pictures film library. As such, Comcast could become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox.A Quick Look at the Disney-Fox DealFox would bolster Disney's streaming and television content. The House of Mouse, which is home to Lucasfilm (the “Star Wars” movies), Marvel ( “Avengers”) and Pixar (“Toy Story”) as well as the Disney brands, will own Fox’s film production businesses including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000. This would bring “X-Men”, “Fantastic Four” and “Deadpool” rights back into the Marvel fold and add “Avatar” — the highest grossing movie in history — to Disney’s family of franchises (read: Disney-Fox Deal to Change Media Industry: ETF in Focus).Disney will acquire the Fox film studio with hit TV series including This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The Disney-Fox merger is yet to receive regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in late 2018 or early-to-mid 2019.Market ImpactThe battle to acquire Fox could transform the entire media industry, putting media ETFs in focus. Below we have highlighted a couple of them:PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio (PBS  -  Free Report)PBS is the only pure play fund providing exposure to media stocks under one roof. It seeks to offer capital appreciation by investing in companies that are selected on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value by tracking the Dynamic Media Intellidex Index. This approach results in the basket of 29 stocks with an expense ratio of 0.63%. Fox takes the third spot with a 5.4% share. The product has often been overlooked by investors as depicted by AUM of $47.2 million and average daily volume of 18,000 shares. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).iShares Evolved U.S. Media and Entertainment ETF (IEME  -  Free Report)This newly launched actively managed ETF has accumulated $4.8 million in its asset base since Mar 21. It offers exposure to 75 media and entertainment stocks with DIS, FOXA and CMCSA making up for more than 5% share each. It charges 18 bps in annual fees and trades in paltry volume of 2,000 shares.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1551,FOXA,"New economic data has been released today’s pre-market, with the inflation gauge metric Producer Price Index (PPI) hitting the tape. Results were more tepid than expected: +0.1% for the month of April, down from the estimated +0.2-0.3% and the March read of +0.3%. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, this number reached +0.2%, and +2.3% year over year.Between the PPI and its sister survey, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out tomorrow ahead of the opening bell, these metrics are illustrative regarding how far and how fast inflation is seeping into the U.S. economy. After the March numbers, which were a bitter hotter than expected, market analysts suspected we may be at the precipice of rampant inflation, but today’s numbers mute this notion.Over time we tend to see the picture more clearly, but for now, expectations that the Fed will need to act more aggressively raising interest rates are not being ignited. Again, we look toward tomorrow’s CPI numbers to complete this picture.Boeing to Lose $20B on Iran Deal PulloutWith President Trump announcing an end to the Obama-era nuclear non-proliferation deal with Iran — removing the U.S. from the agreement still supported by other members Germany, France, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union as a whole — reports this morning on the world’s biggest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), are not good. Boeing stands to lose $20 billion for a contract to produce 110 new planes for Irani airline companies, mostly Iran Air.The company will have either 90 or 180 days to sever the agreement with Iran, which will likely also be subject to renewed sanctions imposed by the U.S. There will reportedly be penalties for failing to do so, but these have yet to be determined. France-based Airbus will also be affected, according to reports, as will aircraft parts producer General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings Activity Stays HeavyThough most of the marquee names on the S&P 500 have already reported earnings in calendar Q1 2018, the amount of companies reporting remains very high. After today’s market close we expect results from firms like 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report) and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF  -  Free Report), and ahead of the bell we have already seen results from the following:Anheuser Busch/InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed earnings report this morning, with 73 cents per share missing the Zacks consensus of 79 cents and down a penny from the year-ago quarter, but $13.1 billion in sales surpassed the expected $12.8 billion.

Boeing stands to lose $20 billion for a contract to produce 110 new planes for Irani airline companies, mostly Iran Air.The company will have either 90 or 180 days to sever the agreement with Iran, which will likely also be subject to renewed sanctions imposed by the U.S. There will reportedly be penalties for failing to do so, but these have yet to be determined. France-based Airbus will also be affected, according to reports, as will aircraft parts producer General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings Activity Stays HeavyThough most of the marquee names on the S&P 500 have already reported earnings in calendar Q1 2018, the amount of companies reporting remains very high.

1553,FOXA,"There seems to be no end to the plight for The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ESPN, as the media behemoth is struggling to bring ESPN back on track. Per media reports, the company is preparing to lay off nearly 150 jobs at ESPN.This will be the second such move after the company made significant cuts in April, which affected mostly on-air commentators. Disney’s ABC Television Group and Disney Channel had witnessed similar retrenchment previously. Notably, both have been witnessing rating decline and stiff competition of late.For some time now, declining subscriber count and higher programming costs have been a cause of concern for Disney’s. The company’s primary cash cow, ESPN, has been under immense pressure as the Pay-TV landscape continues to change owing to migration of subscribers to online TV. Falling subscriptions will have a telling effect on the network’s ad revenues.Disney is making full efforts to bring back ESPN’s golden days. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has completed the acquisition of video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech in September. The company stated that it will use BAMTech to create an ESPN-branded, over-the-top video streaming service that will cover a variety of sports.The company is striving to make its content accessible to more customers. Earlier it had stated that AT&T’s DirecTV will feature channels like ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD as well as Disney Junior in their subscription packages in the upcoming DirecTV Now OTT service. The company also stated that mobile apps are going to play an important role in the future of media and ESPN is rightly on the way of taking the advantage of the trend with wide range of apps.Stock PerformanceDespite investors’ concern about the future of ESPN, the stock has gained 6.5% in a month, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.1%. The recent gain in share price can primarily be attributed to the company’s deal with deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy. Meanwhile, shares of other media stocks like Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) have jumped 6.8%, 23.7% and 2.9%, respectively.Disney currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1554,FOXA,"There were a couple of notable developments in the telecom space last week. Recently, Ajit Pai, the Commissioner of Federal Communications Commission (FCC), revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality. The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14.Notably, in May 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules. There is little doubt that if the FCC repeals Net Neutrality laws, the ISP (Internet Service Provider) industry will be a major beneficiary.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) over its proposed $85.4 billion takeover of media giant Time Warner Inc. TWX). The agency has stated that the proposed deal will increase prices for rival pay-TV operators as well as subscribers. It will also act as a stumbling block for the development of online video. The telecom and pay-TV behemoth has decided to challenge the DOJ lawsuit in the court within the stipulated 60 day time period.Beside the above-mentioned developments, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) too remained in news last week. Verizon and AT&T inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin at the earliest.Per recent news, Verizon and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) are planning to acquire some assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report). These assets include movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic as well as international assets such as the Star network in India and the European pay-TV provider Sky Plc. These units have also been mentioned in recent talks between Twenty-First Century Fox and The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report).Per a recent Bloomberg report, Verizon is close to a new deal with the National Football League (NFL) for digital streaming rights. This deal will allow Verizon’s subscribers to easily access games on all devices — Internet-connected TVs, tablets and phones. The deal is a follow up of Verizon’s previous contract with NFL, which allowed streaming in devices with screens of 7 inches or less. Verizon currently carries A Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover,  Verizon has come up with a range of wireline and wireless offers for Thanksgiving shoppers. The company is trying to attract fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) customers through a five-day promotion, starting from Thanksgiving Day on Nov 23 til Nov 27. Verizon is also offering attractive discounts on smartphone purchases. Under Verizon Unlimited, the telco is offering a $378 discount, which will be credited to the customer's account. The selected latest models under the offer include Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Moto Z2 Force.Outside the United States, The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, recently announced that its decision on the proposed merger between Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) may come in 2018. Earlier, the EC had twice halted its review of the deal -- once in June and again in August. Initially, Qualcomm had anticipated that the buyout deal would be closed by the end of 2017. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.Read the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 16, 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    In a historic decision, the FCC had approved Net Neutrality rules, on Feb 26, 2015, after a majority vote. The five-member regulatory body voted in favor of Net Neutrality with a 3-2 margin. However, the voting pattern was clearly divided along party lines, as three Democrat representatives voted in favor of Net Neutrality, while the Republican representatives opposed it.Ajit Pai, a staunch Net Neutrality opponent, has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed.   (Read more: FCC Plans to Abandon Net Neutrality -- Major Boon for ISPs)2.    The DOJ in its lawsuit complained that the AT&T-Time Warner merger will be harmful to American consumers. The merged entity will enjoy control over both high-quality content and distribution medium, which is likely give room to AT&T to raise prices without investing much in offering innovative products. The DOJ has asked AT&T to either divest it DIRECTV division or Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN. However, the company denied the arguments.   (Read more: AT&T Faces DoJ Lawsuit for Time Warner Bid: What Next?)3.    Per recent news, Comcast was in talks with Twenty-First Century Fox to acquire the mass media company’s assets. Verizon also approached Twenty-First Century Fox about potential acquisitions. Walt Disney is also interested about these assets. However, according to domestic regulations, no company can own two broadcast networks at the same time. While Disney owns American Broadcasting Company television network, Comcast owns NBC Universal.   (Read more: Are Comcast and Verizon Eyeing 21st Century Fox's Assets?)4.    The partnership between Verizon and AT&T implies that the biggest U.S. wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers. Moreover, carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base, thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market. Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model, in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise.  (Read more: Verizon-AT&T Team Up with Tillman to Construct Cell Towers) 5.    On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP Semiconductors share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. In June 2017, the EC launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to assess if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. (Read more: Qualcomm-NXP Semiconductors Merger May Get EC Nod in 2018)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major telecom stocks in both the last week and last six months.In the last five trading sessions, share price movement of the major telecom stocks witnessed a mixed trend. Barring Sprint, all three U.S. national telecom carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile US and AT&T gained value in the last week. However, leading pay-TV operators like Comcast, Charter Communications and DISH Network lost value in the same time frame. Meanwhile, price performances of most of the major telecom stocks were negative in the last six months. Sprint, DISH Network and Telefonica lost significantly in the same time period while America Movil gained the most.  What’s Next in the Telecom Space?We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week. Consequently, we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market movement.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1555,FOXA,"Per a recent FierceTelecom report, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) has come up with a range of wireline and wireless offers for Thanksgiving shoppers.Currently, Verizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wireline OffersVerizon is trying to attract fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) customers through a five-day promotion, starting from Thanksgiving Day on Nov 23 till Nov 27.The company will offer custom TV and phone online for $79.99 per month to new customers who subscribe for Fios Gigabit Connection. Customers who opt for a two-year agreement can also choose a new Google Home, Nest Thermostat E, or a $100 Target Gift Card. The Fios Gigabit Connection bundle will come with a two-year price guarantee and SHOWTIME. Multi-room DVR (Digital Video Recorder) service for two years will be available throughout the holiday season.Fios continues to be an important growth driver for Verizon’s wireline segment. We observed impressive subscriber addition in the wireline segment in third-quarter 2017. During the quarter, Verizon gained 11,000 FiOS digital voice residential customers and 66,000 FiOS Internet subscribers. However, the company lost 18,000 FiOS video users. As of Sep 30, FiOS video subscriber base totaled 4.648 million, down 0.5% year over year. FiOS Internet subscriber count was 5.803 million (up 3.9%) and FiOS digital voice residence customers totaled 3.920 million (up 1%).Fios Gigabit Connection continues to gain popularity among customers. The company has not disclosed the number of customers subscribed to the 1 Gbps service.Wireless OffersVerizon Wireless is offering attractive discounts on smartphone purchases. Under Verizon Unlimited, the telco is offering a $378 discount, which will be credited to the customer's account. The selected latest models under the offer include Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Moto Z2 Force.Additionally, Verizon will give a $100 discount on the purchase of select smartphones — Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Pixel XL, LG G6 and V20, Moto Z Force, and Kyocera Dura Force Pro. Discounts are also available on iPads. However, Verizon has not announced any iPhone offer for Black Friday.Black Friday ShoppingBlack Friday has typically been a dreaded day for the U.S. economy. The phrase initially referred to the day the American gold market crashed on Sep 24, 1869.Accordingly, the Black Friday deals were not so popular until the 1980s. There was no official initiation of the current trend of discounts and hype.  However, during the later part of the 80s, some retailers came up with a way to utilize the day to boost sales.Since then, Black Friday has morphed/changed into something different from what its name suggests. Deals now start on Thanksgiving and run all the way through Small Business Saturday/Sunday into Cyber Monday. The shopping frenzy has spread to the U.K. and places that do not even observe the holiday.However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s that Black Friday overtook the Friday before Christmas as the most popular shopping day of the year.Black Friday has evolved into its own Thanksgiving shopping season that tends to drive retail stocks during the last two weeks of November.Verizon’s Recent DealsVerizon and AT&T have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately-held Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructure. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Verizon, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) are eyeing some of the lucrative assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceDespite such positives, Verizon portrays a disappointing price performance. In the past three months, shares of Verizon have lost 2.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.6%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1556,FOXA,"Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) over its proposed $85.4 billion takeover of media giant Time Warner Inc. . The agency has stated that the proposed deal will increase prices for rival pay-TV operators as well as subscribers. It will also act as a stumbling block for the development of online video. The telecom and pay-TV behemoth has decided to challenge the DOJ lawsuit in the court within the stipulated 60 day time period.DOJ’s Arguments The DOJ in its lawsuit complained that the AT&T-Time Warner merger will be harmful to American consumers. AT&T has a vast pay-TV network. As of Sep 30, 2017, total video connections were 25.083 million. Of the total, DIRECTV satellite connections tallied 20.605 million, fiber-based U-verse connections were 3.691 million and DIRECTV NOW online streaming connections were 0.787 million.On the other hand, Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has the rights to sports telecasts. It also owns the Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN. Moreover, Time Warner owns a 10% stake in Internet video provider Hulu.Therefore, the merged entity will enjoy control over both high-quality content and distribution medium, which is likely give room to AT&T to raise prices without investing much to offer innovative products. The DOJ has asked AT&T to either divest it DIRECTV division or Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN. However, the company denied the arguments.AT&T’s Counter Arguments AT&T has argued that the proposed deal is technically a vertical merger. None of the two companies share any overlapping business. Therefore, the deal is not going to reduce the number of competitors either from media or pay-TV or phone industry. Earlier in 2011, the DOJ permitted Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the largest cable MSO (multi-service operator) to acquire media giant NBC Universal. Nevertheless, AT&T is looking forward to continue talks with DOJ officials to find a solution to the deal.Does Politics Matter to AT&T-Time Warner DealBeside the policy-related arguments cited by the DOJ against AT&T-Time Warner deal, speculation is rife in the industry that political factors too are related to the agency’s strict decision. President Donald Trump has had an adversarial relationship with CNN. During his election campaign, Trump had said on numerous occasions that CNN reporters covered him unfairly. As a candidate, Trump had said that his administration would reject the deal because it put too much power in too few hands. Even after his l inauguration as the president, Trump labelled CNN as ""fake news."" In his recent trip to Asia, Trump stated that the proposed deal might be challenged in court. However, the White House remains silent on this rumor.A Question Mark on Telecom-Cable TV-Media ConvergenceThe DOJ’s decision on the AT&T-Time Warner deal has raised eyebrows on the ongoing telecom-cable TV-media convergence trend. Cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions. Comcast became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has already acquired AOL and the core businesses of Yahoo.The DOJ’s decision put a question mark on the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA  -  Free Report) plans of divesting some its core assets, such as its film or TV studios. Major bidders for these businesses are reported to be Comcast, Verizon and The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report).Technologically, we are moving from triple-play (voice-video-data) bundled services offering to quad play (voice-video-data-mobile) bundled offering.  Video-on-demand is the new norm for telecom, cable TV and media industries. Technological advancements have enabled distributors to come up with different ways of bundling and disseminating content, effective content creation methods and creating new business models. The DOJ’s decision is a major concern for this new business model.Price Performance of AT&T Verizon’s shares have decreased 8.79%, marginally better than the industry’s decline of 8.96% over the past 90 days. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1557,FOXA,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Friday even as investors remained skeptical over the likelihood of the tax cuts legislation gaining passage as early as this year-end. Concerns over tax overhaul plans also weighed on investor sentiment over last week, with both the Dow and the S&P 500 posted second consecutive weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.4%, or 100.12 points, to close at 23,358.24. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.3% to close at 2,578.85. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,782.79, losing 0.2%. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.8 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 2.8% to close at 11.43.Tax Reform Woes Weighed on MarketsOn Thursday, House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.However, investors remained cynical over the Trump administration’s ability to pass the bill in the Senate by the end of this year. This was mainly because Senate’s version of the tax plan was quite different from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% by end of 2017, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut but not before 2019.Along with the tax cut woes, news of a probe into Russia’s interference in 2016 U.S. election also weighed on key U.S. indexes. Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team had reportedly issued a subpoena mid-October to several top officials involved with Trump’s election campaign to submit all Russia-related documents.Following these developments, out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors 7 declined on Friday, with utilities and technology sectors emerging as the worst performers. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Key Earnings for the DayOn the earnings front, shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) jumped 28.2% after reporting fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 87 cents and revenues of $1,870 million, beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It was the best gainer among the S&P 500 companies. Foot Locker has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1558,FOXA,"Shares of Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) opened more than 0.5% lower on Tuesday, the last full trading period before the media behemoth is scheduled to release its second quarter earnings report. Just hours before this highly-anticipated announcement, Disney investors are also digesting news that a key competitor is encroaching on its deal to buy 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets.Disney’s plan to annex Fox’s film, TV, and international properties looked to be nearing completion, but Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has reportedly tossed its hat in the ring with an offer that would increase the value of the acquisition to $60 billion. The original deal between Disney and Fox was for $52 billion.At stake is the future of the filmed media industry, with the proposed AT&T (T  -  Free Report) – Time Warner  merger still hoping to pass regulatory appeal and Comcast already announcing plans to scoop up the remaining chunk of Sky Broadcasting that it does not already own.Which media conglomerates end up with what assets will be a key factor as television moves closer to consolidating the broadcasting and digital streaming business models. Disney has public plans to launch its own over-the-top streaming platform next year, and the rest of the industry is now scrambling to offer a competitive product in an arena that also includes Hulu, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Disney investors will hope for an update on this platform when the company reports its latest results after the closing bell today. Shares of the entertainment giant are down more than 8% over the past year, so the stock could clearly use some invigoration wherever it can find it.Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Disney to report earnings of $1.68 per share and revenue of $14.23 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.0% and 6.7%, respectively (also read: Is Disney Set to Beat Quarterly Earnings Estimates Today?).Meanwhile, our Most Accurate Estimate for earnings—which only considers the most recent analyst EPS estimates—sits a penny higher than the consensus at $1.69 per share. This implies that analysts have become slightly more bullish on Disney’s Q2 report as we have gotten closer to the announcement.It is also worth noting that Disney is trading at just 14.x forward 12-month earnings ahead of its report release. That valuation is close to the stock’s lowest forward earnings multiple over the past year. This might suggest that investor confidence has not quite mimicked analyst sentiment ahead of today’s earnings report.Want more market analysis from this author?

1559,FOXA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is nearing its climax, with the final set to kick off this Sunday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). And although the final matchup isn’t set and the victorious nation has not hoisted the trophy, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) already beat its rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) at the World Cup.When the tournament began on June 14, Adidas held the early lead over Nike. Not only is the German sportswear giant one of just seven official FIFA partners along with Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways, the company also edged out Nike in terms of total team sponsorships.JerseysAdidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970, and will be the official ball of the world’s biggest sporting even until at least 2030. The company also sponsored 12 of the 32 teams at this year’s tournament, including three favorites Germany, Spain, and Argentina. But, Germany didn’t make it out of the group stage and Spain and Argentina were eliminated in the round of 16.Oregon-based Nike spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. Since then, Nike has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world. Nike began the 2018 World Cup with 10 teams sporting its iconic swoosh, including Brazil.More importantly, three out of the four teams that made it to the semi-finals of the World Cup were Nike teams. Furthermore, France defeated Belgium, the lone Adidas team, in the first semi-final game Tuesday. Now, even before England play Croatia on Wednesday in the second semi-final, the World Cup winners are guaranteed to be wearing Nike—all of whom are currently on the front page of Nike’s website.This is great exposure for Nike, especially since Adidas pays millions to be an official FIFA partner, which according to The Telegraph costs between $25 million and $50 million annually.Stars Although the three most famous soccer stars on the planet, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, are all out of the World Cup, there are certainly some big names left.Adidas’ only remaining star is France’s Paul Pogba, who sports a Nike kit for France. The third biggest team sponsor, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list, was Puma. The German sportswear company’s biggest individual star, Antoine Griezmann also happens to play for France (also listen to: A Sportswear Industry Overview Amid Puma's Basketball Push).Meanwhile, two of Nike’s rising soccer stars are England’s Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe of France, both also play for Nike-sponsored club teams. Nike tweeted from its main Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account for the first time in a month to congratulate Mbappe on Tuesday.Nike noted that Kane’s Tottenham and the World Cup were two of the big places the company spent money. “Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25% primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA, brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup,” CFO Andy Campion said on Nike’s recent quarterly earnings call.Bottom LineSome people might say that sports sponsorships don’t matter, and maybe they are less quantifiable to Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) or McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), which are official 2018 World Cup sponsors. But for sportswear companies such as Nike, they are important, especially since the company is actively expanding its reach in the sport. Investors should also note that Nike’s overall soccer revenues climbed 8% to $2.15 billion during its recently completed fiscal year, trailing only sportswear and basketball in terms of growth.The World Cup also offers the chance to reach billions of people around the world, as well as across social media channels such as Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) in highlights that will live for years to come. The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil reached 3.2 billion people total, with one billion reportedly tuned into the final. And while Americans might not love the sport, 60% of Nike’s revenues come from outside of its domestic market.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1560,FOXA,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) sunk on Monday following a Friday report from The Washington Post that the social media company had suspended millions of accounts. Yet, Twitter quickly assured people that most of the removed accounts aren’t included in its metrics. Plus J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) thinks yesterday’s slip represents a solid buying opportunity. And that’s just the start of why Twitter stock looks like a strong buy right now.The ReportThe Post reported last Friday that Twitter’s recent efforts to suspend and remove accounts hoped to “lessen the flow of disinformation on the platform.” Data obtained by The Post reportedly showed that Twitter has been suspending more than 1 million accounts per day in recent months.The worry here was that the removal or suspension of roughly 70 million accounts would negatively impact Twitter’s monthly active user totals, which reached 336 million last quarter. Twitter’s CFO Ned Segal took to his company’s platform on Monday to respond to concerns, stating that “most accounts we remove are not included in our reported metrics as they have not been active on the platform for 30 days or more, or we catch them at sign up and they are never counted.”“If we removed 70M accounts from our reported metrics, you would hear directly from us,” Segal continued. ""This article reflects us getting better at improving the health of the service. Look forward to talking more on our earnings call July 27!”J.P. Morgan Shares of Twitter closed down 5.4% on Monday despite its CFO’s reassurance that it won’t end the quarter with 70 million fewer MAUs, which would have an extremely negative impact on Twitter’s business and stock price. Based on this, J.P. Morgan analysts see Monday’s drop off as a great time to buy shares of red-hot Twitter.J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated his “overweight” rating and reaffirmed his $50 price target for Twitter, which represented a 13% upside from Monday’s close. “We’d be taking advantage of the weakness and recommend buying Twitter shares,” Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Monday.He also noted that the removal of “spammy and suspicious” accounts should be seen as a positive for the company going forward. “Importantly, improving quality on the platform is critical for the health of the service and attracting more users and driving stronger engagement over time,” he wrote.Twitter, like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and other social media platforms have to navigate the somewhat murky waters of troll accounts and the spreading of “fake news.” Luckily for investors, it seems that Twitter has been relatively proactive about cleaning up this problem.Live VideoTwitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its MAUs climbed by 3% to 336 million. The company also noted that it streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts last quarter and announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships, including deals with the likes of Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—featuring a ton of ESPN programming and a FIFA World Cup partnership.Twitter’s push into streaming sports, which is one of the last things people need to watch live, is also expected to pay off. The company now has partnerships with MLS and MLB for live games, and more.The key here is that live video attracts more advertisers, and like Facebook, Twitter makes most of its money from advertising. The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.OutlookShares of Twitter have skyrocketed 135% over the last year, which crushes the S&P 500’s 15.3% climb and also tops Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 76%. This climb includes a nearly 50% surge over the last three months on the back of its impressive first quarter.Looking ahead to the second quarter—which the company is set to report on July 27—Twitter is expected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 112.5% to touch $0.17 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 72.7% to reach $0.76 per share.The company is projected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $700.02 million. Meanwhile, for the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to reach $2.94 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Bottom LineTwitter is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports “A” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company is expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 23.1% over the next three to five years.Twitter is also set to become an even bigger player in the streaming video revolution, and Monday’s selloff presents a solid buying opportunity. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1561,FOXA,"Per a recent Bloomberg report, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) is close to a new deal with the National Football League (NFL) for digital streaming rights. This deal will allow Verizon’s subscribers easily access games on all devices — internet-connected TVs, tablets and phones.The deal is a follow up of Verizon’s previous contract with NFL, which allowed streaming in devices with screens of 7 inches or less. This had limited the market base to smartphone users only.Currently, Verizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with this deal Verizon will no longer remain the only provider of streaming games on mobile devices. Other cable and satellite companies along with streaming providers like DirecTV Now and Sling TV will enable customers to stream NFL games on their phones.Currently, Verizon has mobile streaming rights to NFL’s Sunday day games, along with night games on Monday, Thursday, and Sunday. Verizon’s FiOS TV customers already have access to the games on their screens at home,  owing networks like ESPN and NBC.The financial terms and the duration of Verizon’s supposed contract with the NFL have not yet been disclosed.What to Expect From the Proposed Deal?NFL games are one of the most-watched TV shows in the country. We expect that this deal will boost Verizon’s increasing media assets, as the wireless carrier is focused on its online video and advertising strategies. The U.S. telecom behemoth has already acquired AOL and the internet-based assets of Yahoo to establish a strong foothold in the Telecom-Media space. As per a recent news, Verizon, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) are eyeing some of the lucrative assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA  -  Free Report).Important deals with NFL and the National Basketball Association should ramp up Verizon’s advertising revenues with newer customers.Recent DealVerizon and AT&T have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin as soon as possible.The structures will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the country and will fulfill the availability of towers in newer locations. The build-outs will also help the wireless carriers relocate equipment from their current towers.The joint venture is likely to pose severe competitive threat to established tower companies in the domestic market — American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp and Crown Castle International Corp.Price Performance Despite such positives, Verizon portrays a disappointing price performance. In the past three months, shares of Verizon have lost 5.6% narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.0%.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1562,FOXA,"According to CNBC, media and cable giant Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) approached 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) about potentially acquiring a good portion of its assets. And interestingly, Comcast would want to purchase the same bundle of assets that Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) had talked to Fox about earlier this year.Those assets include Fox’s movie studio and television production divisions, and its cable networks FX and National Geographic. CNBC’s sources added that Comcast is also interested in the company’s international businesses, like the European pay TV provider Sky, likely to broaden its footprint outside of the U.S.Shares of FOXA jumped over 6% yesterday in after-hours trading on the news, and are up about 4.3% to $30.58 per share in afternoon trading. However, CMCSA stock is trading down roughly 1.6% in the same time frame.Just like in a potential deal with Disney, any acquisition by Comcast would be under the same regulatory scrutiny. While no media company can own two broadcast networks, neither of these two conglomerates are interested in buying up all of Fox, said CNBC’s sources.Fox would still keep its profitable news and sports assets, since the company “is said to believe that a more tightly focused group of properties…could compete more effectively in the current marketplace.”But it’s not just Comcast and Disney that are apparently interested in scooping up most of Fox. According to Reuters, telecommunications behemoth Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) is also said to be exploring a deal; its sources said Fox’s assets could give the company ownership of movies and television shows to stream to its mobile subscribers. While a movie studio would be quite a departure for Verizon, content from the likes of Fox could a smart way to spice up its upcoming streaming service as well as boost the company’s targeting advertising.Of course, no official deal has been laid on the table by any of these companies, and right now, it’s all just talk, rumors, and speculation. But as the U.S. Justice Department preps a lawsuit to block the AT&T (T  -  Free Report)-Time Warner  merger, it seems a risky time to propose any sort of major industry deal or acquisition.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1563,FOXA,"Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) are reportedly  planning to acquire some of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets. While Comcast is a cable-TV giant in the United States, Verizon is the largest telecom service provider.As per recent news, Comcast was in talks with Twenty-First Century Fox to acquire the mass media company’s assets. These assets include movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic as well as international assets such as the Star network in India and the European pay-TV provider Sky Plc.These units have also been mentioned in recent talks between Twenty-First Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report). The proposed deal with Comcast or Walt Disney will be subject to the same regulatory norm. According to domestic regulations, no company can own two broadcast networks at the same time. While Disney owns American Broadcasting Company television network, Comcast owns NBC Universal.Verizon also approached Twenty-First Century Fox about potential acquisitions. However, details regarding the deal have been kept under wraps.  All the above-mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why the Convergence Between Telecom-Cable TV-Media Industry?U.S. cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with major acquisitions. Comcast became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011 and Dreamworks Animation in 2016. AT&T is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed $85.4-billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire Time Warner Inc. Verizon has already acquired AOL and the internet-based assets of Yahoo to establish a strong foothold in the Telecom-Media space.The convergence of the telecom, cable TV and media industry has become a growing trend in the last several years.Massive adoption of smartphone and tablets along with continuous development of super-fast data transfer technologies have acted as a key driver of the convergence. A growing economy accelerates the demand for real-time voice, data and video. Since cord-cutting is affecting the cable-TV industry, media companies are more inclined to join operations with telecom giants.Rapid technological advancement is gradually redefining the parameters of these industries. The market scenario is changing rapidly, owing to the aforementioned convergence. Will 2018 witness more mergers and acquisitions between telecom, cable TV and media companies?The legacy local and long-distance wireline phone services have been replaced by wireless services. This has resulted in massive deployment of airwaves and optic fiber-based networks. Internet TV and online-TV streaming services are replacing legacy TV viewing, which has enabled the merger of content creation and distribution. Emergence of digital media and robust growth of digital advertisement are major catalysts.Bottom LineBusiness models and the economics of the telecom, cable TV and industries are transforming. Creators and distributors are trying their best to judge consumer preference, in order to make their content more personalized. Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1564,FOXA,"Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) has emerged a major player in a saturated and intensely competitive market on the back of diverse unlimited data plans.Sprint is reportedly planning to make its unlimited services more attractive by offering free access to online video streaming service provider, Hulu. Hulu is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Time Warner Inc. Its basic service includes TV series, movies, original content and other programming with limited or no commercials.Currently, Sprint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The deal is expected to be officially launched on Nov, 17 and will be available to new and existing Sprint unlimited subscribers. As part of the promotion, users will get free access to Hulu's traditional $7.99 per month streaming plan. Each line on a Sprint family plan will be eligible to get their own Hulu account. The offering is anticipated to strengthen Sprint’s position in the already competitive domestic wireless industry.After almost a year of fierce competition over postpaid and prepaid wireless service prices, national carriers have recently engaged in a war over freebies and discounts on smartphones. Similar bundle deals are  common among telecommunication companies. In September 2017, T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) announced the inclusion of online video streaming service provider, Netflix Inc. (NFLX) in its unlimited postpaid wireless service, T-Mobile ONE.In April 2017, U.S. telecom behemoth, AT&T Inc (T) unveiled plans about bundling a subscription of HBO with its Unlimited Plus wireless service, with no extra charges. Prior to this, AT&T also chalked other promotional offers, providing free access to HBO for a year on it’s over-the-top (OTT) online streaming service, DirecTV Now.Price Performance Despite such positives, Sprint portrays a disappointing price performance. In the past three months, shares of Sprint have lost 28.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 11.1%.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1566,FOXA,"The Dow notched up minor gains over the week, before ultimately declining on concerns related to Trump’s tax proposals. Mergers and acquisitions related reports helped the index notch up fresh records even though movements continued to occur within a tight band. Ultimately, prospects of a delay in the implementation of tax cuts proposals dragged the index downward toward the end of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.1% last Friday on the back of strong earnings performance from Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Better-than-expected earnings and favorable quarterly outlook from the tech giant led all the three key U.S. indexes to new record highs despite mixed jobs data. Additionally, the ISM services index hit its highest level in more than 12 years, which in turn boosted the broader markets.The index gained 0.5% over last week. Benchmarks closed in positive territory for the week after the Fed chose not to hike rates this month. Moreover, the Fed offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ‘solid rate.’Also, House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy, which also boosted sentiments. Additionally, upbeat earnings results also led the markets higher.The Dow This WeekThe index inched up by 0.04% on Monday following news of a possible merger between Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). This is the 26th trading day when all-time high was achieved by all the three key U.S. indexes in 2017, marking the highest number of record highs achieved in a single year. Additionally, optimism over President Trump’s tax cut plans and upbeat third quarter earnings also boosted investor sentiment.The index once gained 0.04% on Tuesday to finish at a fresh record high. Weak profit forecasts from key stocks pulled the consumer discretionary sector downward, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. Also, decline in bond yields weighed on financials and concerns over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans resulted in a small-cap stock selloff.Meanwhile, reports emerged that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) was in talks recently with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) to acquire a large part of the latter’s entertainment business. Although, there is no certainty whether the deal will go through, shares of Walt Disney increased 1% following this development. Gains in Walt Disney boosted the blue-chip index to close on a new high.The index increased 0.03% on Wednesday, settling at yet another all-time high even as Apple’s market value jumped over the $900 billion mark for the first time ever. However, concerns remained over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans after Republicans lost elections to the governorship of Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday. These factors, along with declining bond yields weighed on bank stocks.The index declined by 0.4% on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans.Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.Components Moving the Index Disney reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and also decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million.The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily caused by dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.Even though the company reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during the after-hour trading session on Nov 10 after the company announced that it has sealed a deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy.Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west-central Alberta. It will be the company's first shale play development in Canada.Of the 330,000 acres in the formation, Chevron Canada holds 70% operating stakes, where it plans to start development in about 55,000 acres of the liquid-rich Duvernay. It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin.Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project. The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project, which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019.Canadian shale plays – like Duvernay and Montney – continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands. Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation, Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This deal is among the several agreements concluded during President Trump’s state visit to China.According to the state owned company, which is a lessor of airplanes to China’s airlines, the deal includes the supply of 40 B-777s and B-787s as well as 260 B-737s. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, some analysts opined that this agreement could overlap with a similar 300 plane deal struck during the Chinese president’s visit to the United States in 2015. The deal concluded at that time encompassed the supply of 50 wide body aircraft and 190 B-737s as well as the lease of another 60 B-737s.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has inked three engine and aviation agreements worth $3.5 billion with Chinese partners during President Trump’s state visit to China, which is aimed at boosting trade between the United States and China.

1567,FOXA,"Media behemoth – The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) – reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million. The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily due to dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment. and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.The company’s total operating income came in at $2,812 million during the quarter, down 11% year over year. The downside was due to decline in operating income from Media Network, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media.Despite Disappointing Results Stock Gains: Why?Even though Disney reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during after-hour trading session yesterday. Analysts believe that the deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy may have raised hopes of investors. We note that, the stock has increased 4.2% in a month, outperforming the industry, which has witnessed a decline of 2.8%.Further, Disney plans to launch its own streaming services – one for Disney and Pixar brands, and another for ESPN followers. The company had earlier stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019.Disney will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Meanwhile, through the fresh Disney-branded service, subscribers can view both Disney’s and Pixar’s latest live action and animated movies, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate.Disney Now Controls BAMTechIn an effort to attract online viewers, the company has completed the acquisition of video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech in September.In the past few quarters Disney’s ESPN has been a hot topic in the media industry and investors are closely monitoring the performance of ESPN. In the reported quarter, advertising revenues declined in the low-single digit. Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN continues to hamper the company’s results. Most of the media companies are failing to cope with ""cord cutting"" as consumers are unwilling to pay for large bundles of channels.ESPN has sealed a number of deals with new platform owners, mostly over-the-top. These deals have started to yield positive results and are also increasing the number of subscribers. Moreover, the company has inked a deal with Hulu and another entity, and is also in discussion with others. The company had earlier stated that mobile apps are going to play an important role in the future of media, and ESPN is rightly on the way of taking the advantage of the trend with wide range of apps.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteSegment DetailsThe Media Networks segment’s revenues were down 3% to $5,465 million, primarily due to 11% decrease in Broadcasting revenues to $1,514 million. However, Cable Networks came in at $3,951 million, almost flat year over year.The segment’s operating income came in at $1,475 million, down 12% year over year. Cable Networks saw 1% drop in operating income to $1,236 million, while the Broadcasting segment reported a 15% slump in operating income to $229 million. Drop in operating income at Cable Networks were primarily due to decline at Freeform, which overshadowed the gain at the Disney Channels. At ESPN increase in affiliate revenues were ooffset by higher programming cost and dismal advertising revenues. Decrease in advertising revenues were chiefly due to decline in average viewership. Meanwhile, growth in affiliate revenues was driven by rise in contractual rate, which mitigated the fall in subscribers.Parks and Resorts revenues came in at $4,667 million, up 6% from the year-ago period. The segment’s operating income climbed 7% to $746 million backed by growth at the company’s international operations, which was due to robust performance of Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disney Resort. Rise in guest spending and attendance were the main reasons behind growth in operating income at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, growth at Shanghai Disney Resort was driven by lower marketing cost, increase in attendance, which negated lower average ticket pricing. Meanwhile, operating income declined at the company’s domestic operations due to the impact of Hurricane Irma.The Studio segment generated revenues of $1,432 million, down 21% year over year. Moreover, operating income dropped 43% to $218 million. Sharp decline in operating income was due to decrease in TV/SVOD distribution results and increase in film cost impairments. Home entertainment as well as theatrical distribution results was flat year-over-year. However, decrease in theatrical distribution results were due to better performance of the company’s releases in the prior-year quarter compared with this quarter. However, analysts believe that the coming two years will be the most fruitful for Disney. The studio is all set to continue with its success story beyond Star Wars, Zootopia and Beauty and the Beast as it boasts of an impressive lineup of big budget movies up to 2018. In 2018, the company is expected to release Black Panther, A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Further, movie lovers must be really pumped up as Star Wars saga, The Last Jedi will hit the in December.Consumer Products & Interactive Media division saw a 6% decrease in revenues to $1,215 million. Moreover, the unit’s operating income dropped 12% to $373 million owing to decline at merchandise licensing business.Other Financial DetailsDisney, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

1568,FOXA,"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly numbers, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the stock has not shown much movement since the announcement, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has gained 14.2% in the past six months, surpassing the industry’s rise of 0.6%.Q2 HighlightsLions Gate’s earnings came in at 7 cents per share, which fares much better than a loss of 12 cents recorded in the year-ago period, as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Quote On the revenue front, Lions Gate witnessed a surge of 47.1% year over year to approximately $941 million, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate of $955 million. This can primarily be attributed to a surge in Media Networks revenues. However, on a pro-forma basis, revenues tumbled 10.3%.The company’s adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) came in at $109 million, in comparison with negative $24 million reported in the prior-year quarter. On a pro-forma basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 66.1% year over year. The company’s filmed entertainment backlog was nearly $1.3 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Segmental Performance (On Pro-forma basis)Media Networks’ segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenues of $393.4 million, up about 7% year over year on account of continued solid performance by hit series, Power as well as gains from Outlander’s premiere. Moreover, segment profit came in at $116.5 million, up 42.2% year over year on the back of increased over-the-top revenues; reduced programming expenses and benefits from Power’s licensing. Segment profit margins expanded to 29.6% in the quarter from 22.2%.Motion Pictures reported revenue of $385.7 million, which slumped nearly 24% due to lower theatrical and international revenues, partly compensated by improved home entertainment and television revenues.  Theatrical revenues were marred by lesser featured film releases this quarter, partly negated by robust performance of The Hitman's Bodyguard. International sales fell year over year owing to absence of solid contributions from Now You See Me 2 which aided the year-ago period. On the contrary, Home entertainment revenues gained from Starz third party distribution business, partly offset by lower feature films. However, television revenues were fueled by greater contributions from feature films.The segment logged profit of $8.9 million as against a loss of $5.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The improvement stemmed from lower P&A expenses.Television Production revenues dropped 4.7% to $168.7 million, mainly due to lower domestic television sales. This was accountable to soft revenues from reality shows and unfavorable timing of episodic deliveries of Orange is the New Black. Moreover, segment profit plunged 30.1% to $8.6 million, while the segment profit margin contracted 150 basis points to 5.1%. Financial DetailsLions Gate ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $225.9 million, film obligations and production loans of $294.9 million and shareholders’ equity of $2,826.8 million. The company generated $339.4 million as cash flow from operating activities in the first six months of the fiscal.Lions Gate, which shares space with major studios like Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), is a film studio engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures for theater and straight-to-video release as well as television programming for cable and broadcast networks.Looking for More?

1569,FOXA,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe hit record highs in the first half of 2018 driven by growing ambition of American companies.According to the latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data, global mergers and acquisitions totaled more than $2.5 trillion, up 64% from the year-ago level and marked the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980. With this rise, the mergers are on track to surpass $5 trillion in 2018, which would top 2015, the highest yearly total on record (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).The massive increase in M&A activity came despite growing global trade tensions. United States M&A volumes climbed 82% to $1 trillion, the country’s strongest period for deal making on record. This was followed by European deals, which nearly doubled to $767 billion in the first half.Most of the boost came from media and healthcare deals. The proposed media M&A has totaled $322.5 billion so far – up more than six times from the year-ago level. The sector is poised for more consolidation in the coming months as a federal judge ruling on AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  set the stage for waves of M&A in the media space that would change the landscape of the industry (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).Big deals have driven much of the activity as total number of deals valued at $10 billion or more surged to 36 in the first half of 2018. These constituted $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38% of all activity. The bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the largest contributor. This was followed by health insurer Cigna’s (CI  -  Free Report) deal to purchase Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical purchase deal of Shire for $62.4 billion (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The boom in M&A is likely to continue, given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allow companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time providing short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 61 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) on the long side with each accounting for more than 8% share. The product has amassed $629.2 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 131,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 0.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 39 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fee. Healthcare, financials, real estate and technology are the top four sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.5 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. It is down nearly 1% so far this year. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market. This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1570,FOXA,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) climbed over 2.5% on Thursday on the back of a massive new price target as well as some important news regarding its live video push. So let’s take a look at the most recent news surrounding the social media giant and quickly dive into some of Facebook’s other fundamentals to see if investors might want to buy FB stock.UpgradeBTIG analyst Richard Greenfield raised his Facebook price target from $175 to $275, which marked a roughly 43% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $192.73 per share. The BTIG analyst is now one of two on Wall Street with a $275 FB price target, the highest listed on FactSet.The new upbeat price target stems largely from Greenfield’s belief in the strength of Facebook’s photo and video-sharing app Instagram, which now boasts over 1 billion monthly active users, up from 800 million in September 2017.Instagram currently crushes Twitter’s (TWTR  -  Free Report) 336 million MAUs. Meanwhile, its 500 million DAUs destroys Snapchat’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) 191 million. Instagram also—in a move that will see it compete more directly against YouTube—debuted its new IGTV on June 20. The new app/feature will allow users to upload hour-long video content, up from its previous one-minute limit.“Facebook, since its earliest days as a public company, has talked about the goal of ads becoming content, which has actually happened on Instagram—everyone loves the ads, allowing for greater ad load and higher CPMs,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients. “The ads are so good, in fact, that Instagram is quickly becoming the most powerful and valuable mall in the world where you not only browse, but can buy anything you see.”Furthermore, Greenfield was upbeat about Facebook’s flagship social media platform and noted that users ""simply could not care less"" about the nearly non-stop flurry of negative news surrounding the company this year. “We continue to view Facebook as a must-own stock to maintain exposure to growth of mobile time spent,” Greenfield wrote.Live VideoNews also broke on Thursday that Facebook landed the live broadcast rights for the Premier League—the England based soccer league—in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which is reportedly set to run from 2019 to 2022. Facebook bought the rights to its first Premier League matches in the soccer-obsessed region for roughly £200 million, according to The Times of London.The social media giant’s bid topped BeIn Sports and Fox Sports Asia (FOXA  -  Free Report) to stream each season’s 380-game schedule. Facebook’s deal to stream one of the world’s most popular soccer leagues helps demonstrate its live sports push, which has previously featured MLS and La Liga games. The move also comes after Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced a groundbreaking deal for the exclusive rights to broadcast a small but important set of Premier League matches in the UK.Fundamentals Deals like Facebook’s new Premier League streaming coverage are hugely important in an entertainment age being shaped by the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Hulu. Live sports and live video will help the company further monetize and add to its 2.20 billion monthly active users.Facebook closed the first quarter with 1.45 billion DAUs, up 13% from the year-ago period, with the platform’s MAUs also up 13%—and these figures don’t include Instagram or WhatsApp.Facebook’s impressive user base across multiple platforms has helped it turn into a money-making powerhouse that dominates the advertising business along with Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Last quarter, Facebook reported revenues of $11.97 billion, with ad sales accounting for roughly 99% of total Q1 revenue. The company is reportedly set to grab 19.6% of all U.S. digital ad dollars in 2018, according to eMarketer—with Instagram projected to pull in 5%.Price Movement & ValuationBefore Thursday’s jump, shares of Facebook had climbed roughly 32% over the last year. Investors should also note that Facebook stock is currently trading at 22.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a substantial discount compared to its industry’s 30.5X average. Furthermore, over the last year, Facebook stock has traded as high as 31.5X and as low as 19.9X, with a one-year median of 27.2X. Investors will also see that Facebook is currently trading close to its five-year low, and therefore it is hardly a stretch to say that FB stock appears rather inexpensive at the moment.Outlook Facebook, which announced that it will release its second quarter financial results on July 25, is projected to see its Q2 revenues climb by 43.7% to touch $13.39 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Looking ahead to the full-year, Facebook revenues are expected to climb by 40.5% to touch $57.12 billion.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Facebook’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 31.1% to reach $1.73 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 24.7%.Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. FB looks like it might be worth considering at the moment based on its stellar valuation picture, growth outlook, and massive stock price upside on the back of continued online advertising strength.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1572,FOXA,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest media and entertainment corporations in the world. Known best for its popular animated feature films and tourist-favorite theme parks and resorts, Disney has held a major piece of America’s media identity since its founding in 1923.Disney has grown enormously since its beginnings as a cartoon studio, amassing well-known film, radio, music, television, and other various assets.So what all, exactly, does Disney operate? Here’s a breakdown of the companies by industry that the media conglomerate owns.Walt Disney StudiosWalt Disney Studios is home to four major film studios: Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm Ltd.The company’s animation studio has produced an impressive 56 animated feature films, beginning with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. Its most recent film, Moana, was released in November 2016, and the studio currently has four films in development including Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 and Gigantic.Pixar, who received funding from late Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) co-founder Steve Jobs—he was also the studio’s majority shareholder before Disney bought the company in 2006—has produced 17 films. It’s most recent film, Cars 3, was released this summer, and Pixar has three upcoming films: Coco, coming to theaters this Thanksgiving, and The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4.Together, these films have earned 13 Academy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, and 11 Grammy Awards. Eight of these films won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature; Up and Toy Story 3 were even nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar. Most recently, Pixar’s critically acclaimed film Inside Out won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.In 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Studios, which has produced many movies based on Marvel comic book characters. Thor: Ragnarok just hit theaters, with Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War coming next year.And in 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm Ltd, the studio best known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises. Last December saw Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first stand-alone film in the Star Wars franchise, hit theaters. The film grossed $1.056 billion at the worldwide box office on a budget of $200 million. Episode 8 of the original franchise, The Last Jedi, is set to hit theaters this December, with Episode 9 already in production.Disney could also count its live-action remakes as a fifth pillar of its studio business now that Beauty and the Beast has proven so successful. During its opening weekend, the film brought in $170 million and total box office numbers surpassed $1 billion. Even more animated classics are planning on coming to life; Disney just announced casting for The Lion King, with Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala.Disney Consumer Products and Interactive MediaThe Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media section of Disney includes primarily the company’s retail store, Disney Store, which has over 400 locations worldwide, as well as brand merchandise from feature films and Disney.com.It also operates The Muppets Studio, which produces Muppet-themed movies and television specials, and Disney Publishing Worldwide, a subsidiary that publishes the popular young adult franchises Star Darling and Waterfire Saga, as well as Hyperion Books for children.Walt Disney Parks and ResortsAside from its animated movies, Disney’s Walt Disney Parks and Resorts are the corporation’s most well-known attractions. Disneyland Park, one of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was Disney’s first major theme park. It first opened back in 1955, and is known for its iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle. The other Anaheim-located park is Disney California, which opened in 2001 and is dedicated to the state of California.  Arguably Disney’s most popular theme park is Walt Disney World Resort, located in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando. Attractions include four major parks: Magic Kingdom Park, home to a life-size version of Cinderella’s castle, the company’s most recognizable landmark; Epcot; Hollywood Studios; and Animal Kingdom Park. The resort is also home to two water parks.Walt Disney Parks and Resorts are not limited to just the U.S. The corporation operates the successful Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, as well as Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which opened its doors in 2005. Disney recently opened its Shanghai Disney Resort in China after years of planning and costs of over $5.5 billion. Disney also operates a popular cruise line.Disney Media NetworksIn addition to popular film franchises, Disney owns and operates many television channels. Its biggest subsidiary under Disney Media Networks is ABC, which produces hit network shows Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder and its flagship evening news program ABC World News Tonight.Disney also owns part of Hulu, an Internet streaming video service, along with 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) (under FOX Broadcasting Company) and Comcast, the world's biggest media company in 2015 (CMCSA  -  Free Report) (under NBCUniversal Television Group).Additionally, Disney has been in talks with Fox to buy most of its assets. Though no deal is confirmed, Fox would reportedly keep its news and sports divisions, and potentially sell the rest of its assets to Disney, i.e. its movie studio and television segments.And recently, the company announced plans for its own streaming service after it pulls its movies from Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) popular video streaming platform. Next year, Disney will launch an ESPN streaming service that will provide access to 10,000 live international, national, and regional games every year. Disney is also debuting a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 that will offer Disney movies and TV shows.Disney owns sports network ESPN, and also operates A&E Networks, in a joint venture with Hearst Corporation. Among its popular television channels include The History Channel and A&E, home to Storage Wars, The First 48, Duck Dynasty, and the scripted series Bates Motel. Disney also owns, of course, The Disney Channel.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The deal has received go-ahead from European Commission.As of 2016, Sky already has 21 million pay-TV subscribers and 30,000 employees.

1579,FOXA,"Shares of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) suddenly popped over 6% in Monday afternoon trading, shortly after reports suggesting that the company was looking to sell most of its assets to Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) emerged.According to people familiar with the matter cited by CNBC, Fox has been holding talks with Disney over the past few weeks, but there is no certainty that the discussions will lead to a deal. In fact, these sources said that the chatter has been on again, off again, and the two sides are not currently engaged in deal talks.Per CNBC’s initial report, Fox’s willingness to engage in sales talks stems from a growing sense among senior management that the company would not be able to reach the scale believed to be needed for success in today’s media world through acquisitions.Nevertheless, it does not appear that Disney would purchase all of Fox. Instead, Fox believes that a “more tightly focused group of properties around news and sports could compete more effectively in the current marketplace,” said CNBC.Movie and television production companies like 21st Century Fox have been challenged by the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) in recent years, with each of these tech behemoths working to change the nature of content consumption in their own individual ways.This evolution has also affected Disney, which has struggled with subscriber losses in key entities like ESPN. In response, the massive media conglomerate is preparing to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, and adding another studio such as Fox could potentially bolster that platform’s appeal.Shares of FOXA surged more than 6.5% to touch an intraday high of $26.60 in the wake of CNBC’s initial report.

1580,FOXA,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 8. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 5.9%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Twenty-First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 49 cents, which reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 4%. We note that the rate of decline is likely to decelerate from 20% witnessed in the preceding quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $6,868 million compared with $6,506 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe performance of Cable Network Programming, which has been magnificent in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 owing to rising affiliate fees is likely to impress investors in fiscal 2018 too. Management expects domestic affiliate fee to increase at least in high single-digit in all the quarters of fiscal 2018. Affiliate fees are a dominant source of revenues for the Cable Network segment and major contributor to total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from affiliate fees is currently pegged at $3,140, up 7.4% year over year. Moreover, advertising revenues is also likely to increase 1.5% to $1,615 from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenue from both Cable Network Programming and Filmed Entertainment segments to increase 8.5% and 52.7% to $4,133 million and $1,896 million, respectively. However, growth in both Cable Network Programming and Filmed Entertainment is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Television segment, which is expected to report revenues of $1,056 million compared with the prior-year quarter revenues of $1,907 million.However, increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors. In fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming costs increased 7% to $16,130 million. In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates cable network expenses to rise by approximately mid-single digit. The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs. We believe that an increase in expenses due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the company’s margins and affect the bottom line.Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Twenty-First Century Fox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This year, 22.2 million people in the U.S. will stop their cable television services, marking a 33% year-over-year jump, according to an eMarketer report.Even live sports have taken a hit, as the NFL’s TV ratings were down 5.5% through week seven of the 2017 season. Part of the NFL’s weak numbers can be blamed on the many controversies surrounding the league, but TV networks and sports leagues need to begin to figure out how they will fight against the overall decline in TV ratings that has dragged live sports down as well.The good news for investors with ties to companies that are heavily invested in the NFL and other sports such as ESPN parent Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), NBC owner Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Fox owner Twenty-First Century (FOXA  -  Free Report), is that live sports are currently the only events people really want or need to watch live.Awards shows, presidential debates, and the news also fall into this vital live niche. But people simply don’t need to watch most other TV programs and shows live, and in fact, on-demand, non-appointment viewing is often preferable.On top of that, streaming sports have not yet become widely popular, with Twitter (TWTR) and Amazon’s (AMZN) poor Thursday Night Football ratings offering strong supporting evidence.As streaming services such as Hulu Live and YouTube Live start to pair live TV options along with their on-demand streaming content, TV giants like ESPN and CBS need to prepare—and they have.Make sure you listen to the entire episode of Full-Court Finance if you want to learn more about the future of live sports on TV as the streaming revolution heats up.If you have any questions about the fourth episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1583,FOXA,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report), one of leading media and marketing companies in the United States, is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 26. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.5%. Moreover, in the trailing four quarters, it delivered an average earnings beat of 5.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterManagement had earlier stated that Meredith’s earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018 are likely to be in the range of 60-65 cents a share, down from 75 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Sharp decline in earnings projections for the quarter is primarily due to benefits of 22 cents registered in the year-ago period from robust political advertising revenues. Further, shift from traditional advertising and stiff competition may impact  performance.Nevertheless, strategic endeavors such as increase in digital offerings, the launch of new magazine, The Magnolia Journal, and addition of newscasts across television stations, along with focus on non-advertising revenue generating avenues such as retransmission fees, brand licensing and e-commerce are likely to drive the top line higher.To strengthen its position, Meredith has launched additional newscasts in the Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Nashville, Greenville and Flint/Saginaw markets. The company also renewed licensing program with Wal-Mart Stores, which allows it to showcase 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 5,000 outlets and on Walmart.com.Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Meredith Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 64 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 15%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $397.1 million compared with $400 million reported in the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Meredith is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meredith has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 64 cents. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.66% and a Zacks Rank #3.Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of + 0.13% and a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.   See the pot trades we're targeting>>

1584,FOXA,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Oct 26. In the previous quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.7%.Notably, the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters by an average of 8.2%. Here’s a discussion of the determinants of the second-quarter results.Factors Influencing This QuarterAfter generating record revenues in 2016, WWE had impressed investors with its revenue generation ability. In the first and second quarters of 2017, the company had reported top-line growth of 9.9% and 10.7%, respectively. We believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees will boost the top line further higher.In July, WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports in an effort to augment revenues. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services, WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend. Consequently, this is likely to aid top-line growth.Moreover, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of $100 million for 2017, up nearly 25% from the 2016. In first-half 2017, the company has already generated adjusted OIBDA of $36.7 million. For the third quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million driven by top-line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees. In the fourth quarter, it anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $28-$32 million.However, WWE operates in the highly competitive market of entertainment video. Further, decline in home entertainment and pay-per view revenues has been a major concern for the investors. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first and second quarter of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27% and 3.2%, respectively. The decline in home entertainment revenues has been primarily due to steady shift of consumers to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet.World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 14 cent. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $173.2 million compared with $164.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that WWE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. WWE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP but an ESP of 0.00% makes a surprise prediction difficult.

1585,FOXA,"It was a day of anguish for U.S. fans as its soccer team failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1986, following a shocking defeat at the hands of Trinidad & Tobago. The U.S. national team’s failure to make the final cut might impact the financials of a few media companies as well.Twenty-First Century Fox: The Major LoserTwenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) shelled out over $400 million for the broadcasting rights of this elite soccer spectacle. In fact, the company managed to outbid The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ESPN for the FIFA World Cup tournaments from 2015 to 2022.Per media reports, the company will lose $10 million to $20 million in advertising sales following the elimination of the U.S. team. We believe the failure of the team to qualify for the biggest event in soccer will hurt viewership. Despite the elimination of the U.S. soccer team in the Round of 16 of 2014 World Cup, the matches it played accounted for 20% of the nation’s viewership.However, Fox Sports stated, “While the U.S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world, from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo, stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.”Impact on Comcast’s Telemundo DeportesApart from Twenty-First Century Fox, Comcast Corporation’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) Telemundo Deportes is another media company that had acquired U.S. broadcast rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Telemundo Deportes had paid $600 million for the rights. Together, both Twenty-First Century Fox and Telemundo have paid in an excess of $1 billion. This reflects a substantial rise from the combined cost of $425 million paid by Disney’s ESPN ($100 million) and Univision ($325 million) for the 2010-2014 events.We believe Telemundo, which is an American Spanish-language terrestrial television network, might not get impacted by the elimination of the United States by much as the company will still broadcast matches of Argentina, Mexico, Spain and Columbia, which have dedicated fans in the country.As we know that both viewership and rating are proportional to each other, if the company fails to attract audiences it will result in lower ad revenues, which in turn might affect the company’s profitability.Summing UpThe popularity of soccer has changed drastically over the past few years. Soccer started gaining popularity in the United States, especially after the national team made it to the Round of 16 of 2014 FIFA Men’s World Cup held in Brazil. Moreover, the women’s edition has also managed to garner sizable attraction globally, which was reflected in rising viewership for the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup.Twenty-First Century Fox saw ratings hit the roof when USA defeated Japan 5-2 to lift the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup. With nearly 25.4 million viewers on Fox and 1.3 million on Spanish network Telemundo, it was the highest viewed soccer match in the American history.Both Comcast and Twenty-First Century Fox carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space include Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1586,FOXA,"Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is the one of the world’s biggest media companies, ranking among peers like The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), Viacom , and now, tech giants like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).It is still the United States’ largest broadband provider, with over 22 million high-speed Internet customers. Comcast has an impressive market value of almost $180 billion. Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Philadelphia, Comcast has created a media empire over the years due to smart acquisitions and media asset-building. Let’s take a look at what the media and entertainment conglomerate owns and operates.EntertainmentComcast has a big foothold in the entertainment industry, with many of its assets falling in film and television.FilmComcast owns popular film studio Universal Studios. It is considered one of Hollywood’s “Big 6” film studios, along with Warner Bros. Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios, Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, Fox Filmed Entertainment, and Paramount Motion Pictures Group.The studio has produced classic films like To Kill A Mockingbird, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, and Schindler’s List, as well as the recent blockbusters Get Out andThe Fate of the Furious. Its highest-grossing movie to-date is 2015’s Jurassic World.Universal operates smaller film studio divisions including Illumination Entertainment, art house-centered Focus Features, Working Title Films, Universal Animation Studios, Universal Interactive, Universal Pictures International, and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.Comcast’s NBCUniversal division acquired DreamWorks Animation studio for roughly $3.8 billion last year. While DreamWorks is best known for its hit animated franchises Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, much of the studio's value to Comcast is in the so-called “long tail” of amusement park integrations, merchandise, and other synergistic deals.TelevisionIts most prominent media company is NBCUniversal, which owns and operates a slew of television network companies.In its portfolio, NBCUniversal has the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network, which includes NBC Entertainment, NBC News, NBC Sports, and NBC Studios. It also owns the NBCUniversal Television Group (Universal Television, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, and NBC-owned local television stations around the country), as well as NBCUniversal Cable (includes popular channels like Bravo, E!, USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, mun2, Chiller, SyFy, Sleuth, and Universal HD).The company also owns The Weather Channel Companies with private equity firm Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group (BX). This includes the popular Weather Channel, and its interactive components www.weather.com, and mobile and desktop versions.Through NBCUniversal, Comcast dabbles heavily in sports under NBC Sports Group. This consists of the Universal Sports Network, NBCSN, and the Golf Channel stations, in addition to Comcast SportsNet.Other sports-themed ventures include the MLB Network in partnership with Major League Baseball and other providers; SportsNet New York in partnership with the New York Mets and Time Warner ; Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast in partnership with Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report); and the NHL Network in partnership with the National Hockey League.The company also has a large international presence with Universal Networks International.The division is comprised of the LAPTV (Latin America Pay Television Service), a television company that Comcast co-owns with Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures, MGM Studios, and News Corp (NWSA  -  Free Report)-owned 20th Century Fox.Universal Networks International also owns the Brazil-based Telecine, which is co-owned with Globosat Canais, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, MGM, and 20th Century Fox, as well as Universal Channel Latin America, Universal Channel Brazil, SyFy Latin America, and Telemundo, which includes many local Hispanic television networks.CableComcast did not become the country’s biggest cable provider without acquiring valuable companies along the way.In 1985, Comcast, along with American Television and Communications (a Time, Inc. TIME subsidiary), Tele-Communications, Daniels & Associates, and the Century Southwest Communications Corporation, bought Group W Cable, a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.In 2001, it bought the largest cable television operator at the time, AT&T Broadband, a division of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), for over $44 billion.Then, in 2005, Comcast announced that it had bought Susquehanna Communications, a South Central Pennsylvania-based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff company, for $775 million in cash. This gave the company about 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers.In partnership with Time Warner in 2006, Comcast purchased the majority of the floundering Adelphia Communications Corporation, which was the fifth largest cable company in the U.S. before filing for bankruptcy.Comcast began promoting its Xfinity service in 2010. This includes what they call their “triple play” services: digital cable, cable Internet access, and cable telephone. Today, most of Comcast’s cable services have changed names to reflect the Xfinity brand. For example, Comcast Digital Cable has been renamed ""Xfinity TV,” Comcast Digital Voice became ""Xfinity Voice,” and Comcast High-Speed Internet has been renamed ""Xfinity Internet.”Other Business UnitsIn order to cash in on digital trends, Comcast created a division called Comcast Interactive Media; this unit includes XFINITY.com and xfintityTV.com, popular movie ticket service Fandango, entertainment ticketing company New Era Tickets, online video publishing company thePlatform, and StreamSage.The company also owns and operates sports and entertainment venues under the division Comcast Spectacor. Through this unit, Comcast owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL; it also owns and manages the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.As part of its NBCUniversal division, Comcast owns and operates its theme park subsidiary Universal Parks and Resorts. There are currently four running parks: Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles; Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida; Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, and Universal Studios Singapore in Singapore.Comcast partnered with Disney and 21st Century Fox to form Hulu, a video-streaming entity that is a burgeoning competitor to Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime. At this year’s Emmys ceremony, Hulu became the first streaming platform to take home the coveted award for Outstanding Drama Series for its critically-acclaimed show The Handmaid's Tale, in addition to winning in seven other categories.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

1587,FOXA,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) ushered in good news for its fans in Abu Dhabi as WWE stars will perform live at the Zayed Sports City Tennis Stadium on Dec 7. The tickets for the event will be made available from Oct 11. WWE stars like Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt, Finn Bálor, Cesaro and Sheamus will feature at the live event. This will be the fourth time WWE will host a live event in UAE in the past five years.Notably, WWE programming like Raw, SmackDown, Main Event, NXT, 205 Live, Vintage, WWE Experience, Bottom Line, Afterburn, This Week, WrestleMania and SummerSlam are broadcasted in the Middle East.Considering the huge fan base of WWE in Middle East, we believe the live event will drive the company’s top-line. The year 2016 registered record revenue generation in the history of the WWE with the company reporting highest revenues ever. The company’s record revenues were mainly driven by a substantial increase in revenues in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and gain in WWE Network’s total subscriber base.The company has carried the momentum of 2016 into 2017, with the first and second quarter witnessing revenue growth of 10% and 8%, respectively. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales increase of 7.2% for 2017, higher than the industry’s growth estimate of 6.9%.Strategic EffortsWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries.The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership. Per the deal, both the companies have signed multi-year agreement for airing WWE programming, which comprises of WWE’s leading shows including the likes of Raw as well as SmackDown.In July, in an effort to augment revenues WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. The company has also recently reached an agreement to broadcast hit programs like Raw and SmackDown in Japan, Caribbean and Australia. Notably, WWE and TVA Sports also signed an agreement for airing Raw in French, beginning Oct 10.Stock PerformanceWWE shares have rallied 27.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s marginal gain of 0.2%. However, stocks such as IMAX Corporation (IMAX  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and MSG Networks Inc. (MSGN  -  Free Report), which belong to the aforementioned industry, have witnessed a decline of 28.3%, 3.7% and an increase of 2.6%, respectively.WWE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
