0,PNR,"Those most hurt by the Trump administration's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum could include United Technologies (UTX), Ingersoll-Rand (IR), and Johnson Controls (JCI), RBC Capital Markets warned.X In a noted dated Sunday, RBC Capital's Deane Dray also cautioned that Atkore International (ATKR), Eaton Corp. (ETN) and Pentair (PNR) would feel the pain especially.Trump set off a storm in the stock markets Thursday, saying he would impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. While he said Monday that he doesn't think there will be a trade war, he added that the U.S. is ""not backing down"" on tariffs.Eaton has already sized the tariff impact as a potential 2% headwind to 2018 earnings per share, Dray noted.Overall, the tariffs would squeeze near-term margins for manufacturers of automobiles, HVAC systems, electrical equipment, and construction or building products, Dray added.Still, RBC expects multi-industry companies to eventually withstand the tariff  impact, citing strong underlying fundamentals in the manufacturing sector and the recent tax reform windfall.Shares of United Technologies closed up 1.4% at 131.71 on the stock market today, on reports that Republicans in Congress were pushing back more against the tariff plan. Ingersoll-Rand dipped 0.1%, Johnson Controls gained 1.6%, Eaton rallied 1.8%, Atkore gained 2.6%, and Pentair rose 0.6%.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowMeanwhile, Dray's RBC colleague Joseph Spak argued Friday that the near-term impact of steel tariffs on automakers should be minimal, given that they buy the commodity regionally and on contractual buys, but that the effect would be ""inflationary over time.""But Goldman Sachs warned Friday that higher steel costs could hit Ford's and GM's profits by $1 billion each, representing 12% and 7% of their 2017 adjusted operating income, respectively, CNBC reported.In addition, multinationals with high non-U.S. sales such as 3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) face risk of retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Goldman said.On Monday, Height Capital Markets said the White House is pushing to finalize and release its proposal for a steel tariff by late Thursday or early Friday ""in order to dominate the news cycle over the weekend in steel-heavy western Pennsylvania.""That could give Republican candidate Rick Saccone a boost in a special election for the U.S. House of Representatives on March 13, the firm's Clayton Allen wrote in his note.Allen, a former government policy advisor, warned that lack of progress on details, such as the legal justification for the move and compliance with WTO rates, could yet derail the tariffs. He expects the Trump administration may soften its position slightly to implement tariffs quickly, with exemptions on a country- and company-specific level a possibility.JPMorgan analysts believe quotas are a better option than just tariffs.""Among the three alternative remedies that Commerce Secretary (Wilbur) Ross had proposed to President Trump, option #2 (a tariff of 53% on all steel imports from 12 countries, with a quota by product on steel imports from all other countries equal to 100% of their 2017 exports to the U.S.) and option #3 (a 63% quota on the 2017 imports from all countries on all steel products) were the better alternatives in our view,"" JPMorgan's Michael Gambardella wrote the same day Trump's proposed tariffs were announced.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Tech Stocks Are Setting Up After Finding Key SupportThe Big Picture: Bulls Pound The Bears For A ChangeTrade War Or Not, These 33 Stocks In The IBD 50 Share This Winning Trait2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltWhere Is The Market Headed?

25,PNR,"There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.
"
26,PNR,"That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR). Its stock has spurted up about 62% since the company tied the knot with Tyco International's (TYC) Tyco Flow division, in September 2012, six months after announcing plans.
"
27,PNR,"The $10 billion stock-for-stock merger created a roughly $8 billion-a-year powerhouse in flow control, filtration and equipment protection. Tyco Flow complements Pentair's offerings and gives it a strong position in fast-growing markets, including the energy arena, while giving a nice lift to revenue and profit, as well as generating cost synergies.
"
28,PNR,"The combo also gives Pentair an opportunity to apply its Pentair Integrated Management System to Tyco Flow's business with the goal of boosting efficiency, performance and productivity — in turn driving earnings growth, analysts say. The PIMS approach, as Pentair calls it, involves a studied set of methods and processes for finding new market opportunities, speeding product development and planning rollouts, while trying to stay lean and sharp as a company.
"
29,PNR,"Pentair was already a big player in the water and fluid systems arena prior to the merger, with products ranging from energy-efficient pumps and point-of-use filtration to engineered pumps and fluid processing systems. It also had a strong position in technical solutions with products that guard and protect electronics and electrical equipment such as enclosures and cases, and made heat management equipment and thermal management systems.
"
30,PNR,"Tying With Tyco
"
31,PNR,"Tyco Flow, a maker of flow control products, added to the mix a lineup including highly engineered valves and controls used in energy, general process, mining and water industries.
"
32,PNR,"""The deal was transformational,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy. ""It gets Pentair into the energy market where they weren't a player, and from a financial perspective it doubled the size of the company.""
"
33,PNR,"Pentair posted revenue of $4.4 billion in 2012. It estimates 2013 sales will grow to $7.4 billion.
"
34,PNR,"The rationale behind the deal was diversification, says Quealy.
"
35,PNR,"Prior to the merger, he says, Pentair was ""very strong"" in water and electrical equipment, but had ""de minimis"" exposure to energy. Meanwhile Tyco was ""very strong"" in energy-related applications, he adds, and energy was an area in which Pentair intended to participate.
"
36,PNR,"The combination gives Pentair more exposure to energy applications in industrial sectors and doubles its presence in the energy sector as a combined company, said CEO Randall Hogan on a conference call in March 2012 announcing the deal. Pentair expected the transaction to be ""highly accretive"" to earnings, adding 40 cents a share to 2013 earnings. It estimates combined company earnings will be greater than $5 a share by 2015, reflecting synergies through efforts such as streamlining operations and economies of scale.
"
37,PNR,"Since closing the deal, adds Quealy, Pentair has ""encouraged the Street"" it can hit the 2015 earnings target. Most recently, on Dec. 10, Pentair said in a statement that it ""remains committed to the target synergies from the transaction, and its $5 per share 2015 EPS goal.""
"
38,PNR,"Pentair is able to drive earnings through operating efficiencies and continuous improvement processes, says Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose.
"
39,PNR,"""It's still very early in the process, but right out of the gate it looks like the company is a little ahead of expectations in cost-saving synergies,"" he said. ""The outlook so far is encouraging.""
"
40,PNR,"Fruits Of Synergy
"
41,PNR,"Investors believe the merger was a good move for the company, he says, and consequently the stock has made a fairly large move.
"
42,PNR,"""We think there are a lot of opportunities ahead and clearly see the path to more operating efficiencies and cost reductions,"" Rose said, ""probably on the higher end of expectations.""
"
43,PNR,"Pentair now expects its ""realized synergies"" relating to the merger integration in 2013 to be about $120 million, above the $90 million previously estimated, said Hogan on the company's Oct. 22 third-quarter conference call.
"
44,PNR,"""The increase over previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and lean savings in Flow Control and is the result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system,"" Hogan said.
"
45,PNR,"Quealy figures Pentair is in about the ""third or fourth inning"" of the merger integration process.
"
46,PNR,"Pentair will likely shed more light on its prospects in the wake of the merger when it gives its full-year 2014 outlook on Tuesday.
"
47,PNR,"Quealy says he expects the forecast to be ""consistent with other industrials,"" and that he doesn't expect any ""major surprises.""
"
48,PNR,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2014 earnings rising 24% to $3.96 a share.
"
49,PNR,"Meanwhile, Pentair is faring well on the financial front, with double-digit profit gains the past two quarters. Earnings rose 34% to 86 cents a share in the third quarter. Sales jumped 111% to $1.8 billion. Analysts expect full-year earnings to rise 34% to $3.20 a share.
"
50,PNR,"""The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line, as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%,"" said Hogan on the quarter's conference call. ""Price and productivity more than offset inflation, mix was positive and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25%, even though sales declined 1% organically.""
"
51,PNR,"Regional Ups And Downs
"
52,PNR,"But sales were $50 million below Pentair's expectations, he added, due primarily to weak results in Australia. The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.
"
53,PNR,"On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.
"
54,PNR,"Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.
"
55,PNR,"Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.
"
56,PNR,"The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.
"
57,PNR,"In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.
"
58,PNR,"Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.
"
59,PNR,"Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.

60,PNR,"On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.

The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.The same day, Pentair said that its board has approved changing the parent company's place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed change at an anticipated second-quarter shareholders meeting.The current Swiss firm Pentair Ltd. will become a newly-formed Irish company named Pentair PLC.That will be the parent company of Pentair and its subsidiaries, and will have tax residency in the U.K. It will trade under the current Pentair stock symbol PNR on the NYSE.

86,PNR,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in PNR.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen five estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $4.03 a share a month ago to its current level of $2.28.Also, for the current quarter, Pentair has seen three downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 69 cents a share from $1.15 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 36.8% in the past month.Pentair plc Price and Consensus Pentair plc Price and Consensus | Pentair plc QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Manufacturing - Thermal Products industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA  -  Free Report).

87,PNR,"If you are still holding on to shares of Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak. Pentair has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period owing to material and other cost inflation  as well as headwinds pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business. Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Further, negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal indicate bleaks prospects for the company in near term. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.  Shares of this diversified industrial manufacturing company have plunged approximately 38% year to date, faring worse than the industry’s decline of 12%. Let’s take a look at factors behind this dismal performance. Material Cost Inflation Persist The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth is likely to be limited in the near term or may even decline. Further, Pentair continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials. Risks Pertaining to Electrical Business Separation Pentair's separation of the Electrical business will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively. Although the separation will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Moreover, Pentair will also incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended benefits are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Foreign Currency Headwinds Sales outside the United States accounted for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could have an adverse material effect on the company’s revenues. Additionally, currency variations could have a negative material effect on margins on sales of products in countries outside the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside the country. Looking at the prevailing challenges and an unfavorable Zacks rank, it is wise to stay away from investing in Pentair stock right now. Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc. (BOOM  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). All of these stocks carry sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

88,PNR,"On May 4, we issued an updated research report on Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report). The company’s results in the near term will bear the brunt of material and other cost inflation. Further, concerns pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business remain. Sound Q1 Results Pentair delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, up 35% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents as well as management’s guidance of 81-83 cents. Guidance Reflects Electric Business Separation Pentair initiated second-quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 67-69 cents. Sales is expected to be around $0.79 billion, up 4-5% on a reported basis and up 3-4% on a core basis compared with second-quarter 2017. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $2.25 and $2.30. Sales are projected at $2.96 billion, up 3-4% on a reported and core basis over 2017.  Both the guidance ranges reflect the separation of its Electrical business, nVent Electric plc. Electrical Business Separation Completed, Risks Persist Pentair has completed the separation of its Electrical business, which is now held by nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), a new independent, publicly-traded company.  nVent shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018, under the symbol ""NVT"". This will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively.  Both the companies are well-positioned for long-term growth as well as value creation and also possess the scale and strength to flourish as separate entities. Pentair will continue to operate as a leading global water company focused on smart and sustainable solutions. Although the separation of the Electrical business from the Water business will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Pentair will incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees along with ongoing costs in connection with the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended gains are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Following the spin-off, trading price of Pentair’s shares is likely to decline and may experience greater volatility as it will no longer reflect the value of the Electrical business. Until the market has fully analyzed the company’s value without the Electrical business, the price of shares may experience higher volatility. Moreover, the shares may not match some holders' investment strategies or meet criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios, which could cause investors to sell their shares. Excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of Pentair’s shares to dip. Factors That Might Restrict Results The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth will likely be limited in the near term or may decline. Sales outside the United States accounted for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could have an adverse material effect on the company’s revenues. The company continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials.  Pentair underperformed its industry’s performance with respect to share price, over the past year. The stock slumped 33%, while the industry recorded growth of 4%. Zacks Rank and Key Picks Pentair currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Caterpillar Inc.

90,PNR,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for quite some time now, owing to material and other cost inflation along with concerns pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business.

91,PNR,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for PNR broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 20.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for PNR stock.If that wasn’t enough, PNR isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

145,PNR,"Here we have briefly discussed some stocks that hold strong long-term potential and might attract long-term investors. In the S&P 500 group, machinery company Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report), with a market capitalization of $8.1 billion, has strong earnings growth potential, roughly 11% over the next 5 years.

148,PNR,"The IMF projects the world economy to grow 3.1% in 2015 and 3.6% in 2016, down 20 bps from the prior forecasts for both years. While global uncertainties are likely to restrict growth momentum of the advanced nations, these might also adversely impact the progress of emerging/developing nations in the near-to-medium term. Such macro headwinds are anticipated to darken the outlook of machine and tool manufacturers as well.

151,PNR,"The Q1 earnings season has kicked off on an impressive note, with total earnings for the 24 S&P 500 members that have released results so far, surging 39.3% year over year on 11.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends report. Notably, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 16.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues this season, highlighting the highest quarterly earnings growth rate in the last seven years.Industrial Sector on Growth PathThe Industrial Products sector, currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors which are expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reform. According to our latest numbers, the sector’s earnings are on track to be up 24.1% in the quarter compared with last year.The Industrial Products sector, which was affected by soft commodity prices, reduced investment in the energy sector, dismal economic conditions in some developed and developing nations in the last few years, regained its ground last year. The turnaround in its performance is chiefly backed by increased infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies of the new administration. Rise in manufacturing and mining activity also played a crucial role.Driving Factors for the Sector in Q1Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. U.S. industrial production inched up 0.5% in March. Further, U.S. housing starts rose 1.9% in the month led by rebound in construction of multi-family housing units.Also, the U.S Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-12 month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 52 in February. Any score more than 50 indicates billings growth and reflects a healthy business environment.However, the latest report of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) stated that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) edged down 1.5% to 59.3% in March from February. This indicates the likely surge in raw material costs, as well as fear among manufacturers about the impact of steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed by Trump last month. U.S.-China trade tensions haven't allayed as Trump seeks an added tariff of $100 billion on China products in addition to the already-proposed $50 billion.It will be interesting to see how some of the industrial stocks fare when the companies release first-quarter 2018 numbers on Apr 19.Our PicksW.W.

153,PNR,"Pentair plc’s (PNR  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved the separation of its businesses. This approval will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively.  Both the companies are well-positioned for long-term growth and value creation and also possess the scale and strength to flourish as separate enities. nVent ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on the NYSE on May 1, 2018 under the symbol ""NVT"". Separate Identities, Immense Growth Prospects Pentair currently operates in two segments — Water Quality Systems and Electrical segment. In May 2017, the company had announced the separation of its Water and Electrical businesses into two standalone companies. Water Quality Systems designs, manufactures, markets and services innovative water system products, and solutions to meet filtration and fluid management challenges in food and beverage, water, swimming pools and aquaculture applications. It generated 57% of fourth-quarter 2017 revenues. The Electrical segment contributed the remaining 43%. It designs, manufactures, markets and services products that guard and protect some of the world’s most sensitive electronics, and electronic equipment, as well as heat management solutions designed to provide thermal protection to temperature sensitive fluid applications. Pentair will continue to operate as a leading global water company focused on smart, sustainable solutions. Meanwhile, nVent will be a high-performance electrical company focused on improving utilization, lowering costs and maximizing customer uptime.  With well-recognized brands, attractive margin profiles, strong free cash flow generation prospects and opportunities, both the companies are poised for long-term, sustainable growth. Details of the Separation On separation, ordinary shares of nVent will be issued directly to holders of Pentair ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. The distribution will occur prior to the opening of business on Apr 30, 2018. Each Pentair shareholder will receive one ordinary share of nVent for every ordinary share of Pentair held as of the close of business on Apr 17, 2018, the record date for the distribution. Starting Apr 16, 2018 and continuing through Apr 30, 2018, it is expected that there will be two markets in Pentair ordinary shares — Pentair shares that trade in the ""regular way"" market will trade with an entitlement to nVent ordinary shares to be distributed pursuant to the distribution and shares that trade in the ""ex-distribution"" market will trade without an entitlement to nVent ordinary shares. The nVent Form 10 has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) containing information regarding nVent and its business, including details of the separation and distribution. It also identifies certain risks of owning nVent ordinary shares. The separation and distribution of nVent ordinary shares is subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, which include the declaration that the Form 10 is effective by the SEC.   Able Leadership to Steer Toward Growth In October 2017, Pentair unveiled the name of the future Electrical company as nVent Electric plc and announced additional key leadership. Beth A. Wozniak, will assume the position of CEO of nVent upon completion of the separation. Also at the helm will be Stacy McMahan as Chief Financial Officer and Randall J. Hogan will serve as Chairman of nVent and retire as Pentair's Chairman and CEO upon the separation. Outlook for 2018 During its fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, Pentair had issued 2018 adjusted EPS guidance for Water of $2.20-$2.30 per share, on core sales growth of 2-4%. It expects corporate expense for to be around $55 million, while interest expense is estimated to be around $20 million. For nVent, it initiated 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70-$1.80 per share. Pentair also expects corporate expense of $45 million and interest expense of $30 million.  Pentair underperformed its industry’s performance with respect to share price, over the past year. The stock gained 11%, while the industry recorded growth of 24% due to material and other cost inflation pressures. Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Other top-ranked stocks in the same sector include Mobile Mini, Inc.

154,PNR,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) provided details of long-term goals which include delivering annual core sales growth at 2-4% and segment income growth of 6-8%. The company expects to achieve base adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8-10% annually, which factors in approximately $150 million of share repurchases per year. Q2, Fiscal 2018 Guidance Reaffirmed The company affirmed second-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance at 67-69 cents provided at first-quarter conference call. It continues to expect second-quarter sales to be approximately $0.79 billion, up 4-5% on a reported basis and up 3-4% on a core basis compared with the year-ago quarter.  The company also maintained fiscal 2018 earnings guidance between $2.25 and $2.30. Sales guidance remains at $2.96 billion, up 3-4% on a reported and core basis over 2017.  Further, the company continues to target full-year free cash flow of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. During fiscal 2017 and first-quarter fiscal 2018, Pentair underwent certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing fixed cost structure and began realigning business in contemplation of the separation of the Electrical business. These actions will contribute to margin growth in 2018. Segment income is anticipated to be up around 8% for the year. Further, both these guidance ranges reflect the separation of its Electrical business, nVent Electric plc. Share Repurchase Program Announced Pentair’s Board of Directors has authorized it to repurchase up to $750 million of its common shares.  The new authorization expires on May 31, 2021.  This new authorization replaces the previous authorization under which $450 million remained available for share repurchases as of Mar 31, 2018. Electrical Business Separated Pentair has completed the separation of its Electrical business, which is now held by nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), a new independent, publicly-traded company.  nVent shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018, under the symbol ""NVT."" The separation will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and ""nVent"", respectively.  Both the companies are well-positioned for long-term growth and value creation, and also possess the scale and strength to flourish as separate entities. Pentair will continue to operate as a leading global water company focused on smart, sustainable solutions. With well-recognized brands, attractive margin profiles, strong free cash flow generation prospects and opportunities, both the companies are poised for long-term sustainable growth. However, risks persist in connection with the separation. Pentair will incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees along with ongoing costs in connection with the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended gains are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Material Inflation to Dent Margins The company continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials.  Pentair underperformed its industry’s performance with respect to share price, over the past year. The stock slumped 34%, while the industry recorded a decline of 11%. Zacks Rank and Key Picks Pentair currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Caterpillar Inc.

The IMF projects the Euro Area to grow by 1.5% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2016.Zacks Industry Rank – Negative
"
168,PNR,"According to the Zacks Industry classification, Machinery is broadly grouped under the Industrial Products sector, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of the earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
169,PNR,"As a rule, industries in the top 50% of all Zacks industries outperform the bottom half by a wide margin. Going by this rule, industries with Zacks Industry Rank of 132 and lower would fall in the top half, while those with Zacks Industry Rank of 133 and higher would be in the bottom half.
"
170,PNR,"The machinery industry is sub-divided into 9 industries at the expanded level: machine tools and related products (with Zacks Industry Rank #243), construction and mining (#249), electrical utilities (#245), electrical (#145), farm (#106), general industries (#241), material handling (#207), print trading (#249) and thermal processing (#106).
"
171,PNR,"This means that the outlook for the industry remains negative.Earnings Trend of the Sector
"
172,PNR,"The Industrial Products sector accounts for 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and is expected to bring in 2.1% of the index’s estimated total earnings for third-quarter 2015.
"
173,PNR,"As of Sep 4, 2015, all the Industrial Products companies in the S&P 500 group reported their results for the Apr-Jun quarter. Earnings declined 16% year over year with a beat ratio of 58.3%, while revenues fell by 9.8%.
"
174,PNR,"Taking into consideration the prevalent headwinds, earnings for the Industrial Products sector are anticipated to decline by 23.4% in the third quarter, while revenues are predicted to fall by 11%.Key Players in the Machinery Industry
"
175,PNR,"Stocks with high investment rankings can be of interest to investors who seek exposure in the machinery industry. In the S&P 500 group, machinery-company Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report), with a market capitalization of $9.6 billion, carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has strong earnings growth potential, roughly 9.3%, over the next 5 years.
"
176,PNR,"Non-S&P 500 billion-dollar stocks in the machinery industry which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) are AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), AO Smith Corp. (AOS  -  Free Report) and Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report). Also, John Bean Technologies Corporation (JBT  -  Free Report) and Atlas Copco AB (ATLKY  -  Free Report) carry a Zacks Rank #2.
"
177,PNR,"However, three billion-dollar machinery companies with low investment value of Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the S&P 500 group are Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report), Joy Global, Inc. (JOY) and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report). Also, Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation plc (ETN  -  Free Report) currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Going Forward
"
178,PNR,"The uncertain macroeconomic environment is expected to cloud the near- to medium-term outlook of machine and tool manufacturers. The IMF has reduced its growth projection for the global economy for 2015 by 20 basis points to 3.3%, while anticipating 3.8% growth in 2016. We believe the much-desired improvement in the economy as well as the machinery industry can only be achieved on the back of effective governmental policies, huge infrastructural investments, creation of jobs and emphasis on trade relations.
"
179,PNR,"The tone of today’s trading action will likely be negative given the less-than-inspiring Durable Goods reading this morning. A weak bond auction in Spain and soft GDP report in the UK will likely remind investors of Europe, though the worst of Europe-centric fears have receded to the background. Importantly, it is perhaps fair for stocks to take a wait-and-see approach ahead of next week’s important set of economic data.
"
180,PNR,"But the major news of the day is the weaker-than-expected February Durable Goods Orders report this morning. While the report showed improvement from January, which was modestly revised higher, it nevertheless came short of expectations.
"
181,PNR,"‘Headline’ Durable Goods Orders increased 2.2% in February, compared to the 3.6% drop in January and December’s 3.2% gain. ‘Core’ Durable Goods Orders, officially called non-defense capital goods orders ex-aircraft, were up a weaker-than-expected 1.2% after the 3.7% decline in January and December’s 3.8% gain. The ‘core’ reading strips out defense and aircraft orders given their inherent ‘lumpiness’ on a month-to-month basis, and is a good proxy for capital expenditure trends in the economy.
"
182,PNR,"The monthly Durable Goods reading has a pronounced seasonal quirk, where the reading in the first month of the quarter typically shows a decline, then gets reversed the following month. The positive February reading following the January decline is a continuation of this trend.
"
183,PNR,"However, the lack of sufficient momentum in the rebound that the market was looking for is modestly disappointing. The new orders components of regional manufacturing surveys have been fairly robust, but we will have to wait for Monday’s March manufacturing ISM report to get the industrial sector’s pulse.
"
184,PNR,"In corporate news, Tyco International (TYC) announced a deal to combine its pipes and valves unit with Pentair (PNR  -  Free Report) in a roughly $4.5 billion transaction. The combined company is expected to keep the Pentair name. Please recall that Tyco is in the process of splitting itself up into three independent companies focused on its three main business lines: home security, pipes and valves, and fire protection. Tyco expects to complete the separation process later this year.
"
185,PNR,"In other news, Family Dollar Stores (FDO) came ahead of EPS expectations on in-line revenue, but saw a sharp jump in store inventories, likely clouding the outlook for the current quarter. PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report), the apparel maker, posted better-than-expected results but guided lower for the current quarter.RELATED ARTICLESTrading vs. InvestingHave Investors Become Too Complacent?""Bernanke Put"" Has Effect

187,PNR,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries:1) Professional & Business Services: +46,000(up 548,000 over the last 12 months)2) Manufacturing: +31,000(up 189,000 over the last 12 months)3) Health Care: +30,000(up 296,000 over the last 12 months)4) Construction: +23,000(up 132,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 4 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(ADP  -  Free Report) Automatic Data Processing(Professional & Business Services)(PNR  -  Free Report) Pentair(Manufacturing)HYH Halyard Health(Health Care)(MTZ  -  Free Report) MasTec(Construction)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place.

191,PNR,"A few industrial machinery companies have lined up to report quarterly numbers on Jan 30.  The industrial products sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors) is among the Zacks sectors anticipated to rack up the strongest gains in the fourth quarter. Overall fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to climb 29.5% while revenues are expected to go up 13.7%, per the latest projections. The fourth-quarter earnings projections for the industrial sector is backed by upbeat manufacturing data, strong housing and commercial construction markets, growth in job additions and an improving U.S economy. Industrial production, which is considered one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks, jumped 8.2% at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. It is a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. The upbeat performance can be attributed to a 7% jump in manufacturing and 12.7% in mining output in the quarter. Further, it has gained 3.6% in a year, logging its biggest calendar-year gain since 2010. Manufacturing activity also closed on a high in 2017 as evident from the December PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) reading of 59.7, per the Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”).

194,PNR,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) is no more in investors' good books as evident from the recent fall in its estimates and negative growth projections. Material and other cost inflation along with headwinds pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business have largely weighed down the stock.  Pentair has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which indicates possibilities of underperformance in the near term. Stock Continues to Decline  Shares of Pentair have declined around 31.9% in the past month, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 5.9%. Estimates Decline In the last 30 days, five estimates for fiscal 2018 and four estimates for fiscal 2019 have been revised downward versus no upward estimate revisions. This indicates analysts’ pessimism regarding the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for fiscal 2018 plunged 40% to $2.28 and for fiscal 2019 has declined 39% to $2.46. Near-Term Headwinds to Revenues, Margins The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth is likely to be limited in the near term or may decline. Pentair continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials. For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.28, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 35.41%. Revenues are projected at $2.96 billion, a year-over-year dip of 40%. Risks Pertaining to Separation of Electrical Business Pentair's separation of the Electrical business will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively. Although the separation will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Also, Pentair will also incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended benefits are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Forget Pentair, Check These Industrial Stocks That Witnessed Positive Estimate Revisions Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for full-year 2018 have increased by 15% to $10.58 per share in the last 30 days while estimates for 2019 rose 13% to $11.91 per share.
