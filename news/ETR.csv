Favorable weather in the first quarter helped make a good comparison vs. the year-ago period.The majority of Entergy's earnings come from its regulated utility business.

5,ETR,"Electricity consumption tied to Bitcoin and other digital currencies on computer networks could give a boost to some U.S. utilities and create partnership opportunities for renewable energy developers, says a Morgan Stanley report.""Though the overall impact from increased demand seems minimal at this time, the key utility beneficiaries we would highlight include: American Electric Power (AEP), Xcel Energy (XEL), and Entergy (ETR),"" Nicholas Ashworth, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a report to clients published Wednesday. ""These utilities serve the regions with the lowest cost of electricity, and American Electric Power and Xcel are taking advantage of low-cost wind (power) to drive rates even lower.""""There is also the potential for wind and solar developers, we would highlight NextEra Energy (NEE) and Pattern Energy (PEGI), to get involved in supplying 'firm' renewable power solutions to concentrated mining operations,"" Ashworth added.Digital currency transactions require energy-intensive computer networks. A public ledger, called a blockchain, provides a record of where every digital token was first ""mined"" using computing power. For Bitcoin, verifying a transaction and adding it to the blockchain earns a miner a specific number of bitcoins.By design, Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive — in terms of computing power and electricity — to add new blocks. Cryptocurrency power use is facing more scrutiny, particularly in China, where officials are concerned miners are taking advantage of low electricity prices.Some parts of the U.S. — such as the Midwest and Northwest — could also offer mining networks low power costs, Ashworth said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.""Electricity consumption from Bitcoin in 2018 could be as great as we forecast for global electric vehicles in 2025,"" Morgan Stanley added.""However in theory Bitcoin's energy usage should decline in the long run. The network is designed to produce one block every ten minutes, regardless of energy use. The Bitcoin reward for mining a block however halves every four years — the next time is in 2020. If it becomes unprofitable to mine, then in theory less mining will occur.""RELATED:Is Resistance In These 2 Stocks A Warning For Chip-Sector Investors?Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetJust How Many More 'Blockchain Pretenders' Could 2018 Bring?Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

23,ETR,"President-elect Donald Trump's advisors are looking at ways in which the U.S. government could help nuclear power generators being forced out of the electricity market by cheaper natural gas and renewable resources.In a document obtained by Bloomberg, Trump's transition team asked the Energy Department how it can help keep nuclear reactors ""operating as part of the nation's infrastructure"" and what it could do to prevent the shutdown of plants. Advisors also asked the agency whether there were any statutory restrictions in resuming work on Yucca Mountain, a proposed federal depository for nuclear waste in Nevada that was abandoned by the Obama administration.The list of questions to the Energy Department offers one of the clearest indications yet of Trump's potential plans for aiding America's battered nuclear power generators. Five of the country's nuclear plants have closed in the past five years, based on Energy Department data, and more are set to shut as cheaper supplies from gas-fired plants, wind and solar squeeze their profits.Media representatives for the Trump transition and Energy Department didn't immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Some environmentalists have warned the closures could undermine efforts to combat climate change as nuclear reactors are the biggest source of zero-emissions power in the U.S. Plant owners including the nation's largest — Exelon (EXC) — have sought relief from state policymakers, with New York and Illinois among those that have approved millions in annual payments to keep reactors running.Among a list of questions the Trump team sent to the Energy Department was whether the agency has plans to resume the license proceedings for Yucca Mountain and how it can continue supporting the permitting of small modular reactors, seen as the next generation of nuclear technology.On Thursday, Entergy (ETR) announced that it'll shut the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan in 2018, adding to the growing list of reactors planning to retire early.Trump's administration could help the nuclear industry by offering new incentives or subsidies, but Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Rob Barnett called the prospect ""highly unlikely.""Barnett added: ""Another way to help nuclear, at least indirectly, would be a carbon tax. That's also likely a nonstarter.""Trump has voiced his support for nuclear power in the past. In a television interview with Fox News in 2011, he said he was ""very strongly in favor of nuclear energy,"" while stressing the need for safeguards at plants.Last month, the Washington trade group Nuclear Energy Institute congratulated Trump on the election and encouraged him to advance his support for the industry and maintain ""its indispensable role in our critical energy infrastructure and environmental interests.""

24,ETR,"Investors have lavished more love on iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) than on any other equity ETF so far this year.USMV has seen $5.28 billion in net inflow in 2016, helping assets balloon 82% to $13 billion.Investors in its category sibling, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), are likely feeling deflated and perhaps even a bit miffed.SPLV has soaked in a relatively modest $1.8 billion during the same period. That's despite gaining 8.4% over the past year vs. 6.7% for USMV.Both are faring far better than SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market that has tumbled 1.4% in the past year.So why is SPLV proving less popular, as reflected in its in inability to attract more new money?Partly because this exchange traded fund gets knocked by rivals for being little more than a utility fund, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.As of the May 20 quarterly rebalance, its weighting in the utilities sector actually went up a further 7.2% to more than 20%. It gained 13 stocks, including utility firms American Water Works (AWK), Entergy (ETR) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG). It also dropped 13 stocks, including T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Pfizer (PFE).SPLV screens for the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and gives a bigger weighting to stocks with lower volatility.USMV also offers exposure to U.S. stocks with potentially less risk than the broader market. However, it constrains sector weightings to within a 5% band relative to the parent MSCI USA index.That holds appeal for institutional investors whose mandates and compensations are tied to closely following the benchmarks, according to Kalivas.""Our customers are more nimble advisors"" who are more apt to drift away from the benchmarks, he said.SPLV has no maximum or minimum sector-weight requirements. And that is a good thing, Kalivas argues. For example, the utilities stake in SPLV has varied greatly over the years. It was as high as 32% in 2011, went down to less than 3% in 2015, and is now ""marching back up,"" Kalivas pointed out.Right now, SPLV has no exposure at all to the volatile energy sector.""If a sector comes under stress and has a lot of volatility, you can avoid it (entirely),"" Kalivas said. He cites the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the earlier tech crisis as periods when SPLV's unconstrained methodology ""would have been a big help."" Neither SPLV nor USMV has a 10-year history.Critics point out that SPLV makes big sector bets in the utilities and consumer staples sectors. This ETF tends to get hit hard when sector or interest-rate risk comes into play.

25,ETR,"Stress doesn’t have to cause distress. How resilient pros face calamity with confidence:Stand tall. When a crisis hits a business, the events are often out of your control. But a leader’s reaction can be mastered.“Hold on to that, even if the world is cascading down around you,” said Martha Johnson, co-author with Harry Hutson of “Navigating an Organizational Crisis.”Speak clearly. In tough times, employees look up for guidance. “A leader needs to make sense of things as quickly as possible,” Hutson told IBD.When 2005’s Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, power firm Entergy (ETR) had to react fast.Rod West, executive vice president, told evacuated workers how bad the damage was in clear terms: “The city is underwater. So for most of you, everything you left at home is destroyed.”Clarity is essential.“There was no time for happy talk,” Hutson said. “One of the first things leaders have to do is tell the truth.”Move them. West cried with his workers as they came to grips with their new reality.“But I had to stop,"" he recalled, ""and I had to stand up, get back behind the podium, gather myself and say: All right, there’s the plan.”Find strength. Prepare for catastrophe by building what Hutson and Johnson call pre-resilience. Ask yourself how you’ve handled small crises. Think about what you did right and be ready to return to that skill set.“Those resilience muscles are what gives you confidence,” Johnson said.Frame it. Storytelling has a role during disasters. Leaders should be able to craft a realistic narrative of how difficult events are being handled and what’s coming next.The message to employees: We are in this together.“It acts effectively as the campfire,” Hutson said.Gain wisdom. Hutson and Johnson interviewed several pros who weathered work-related upheavals.“It’s so vivid for people,"" the authors wrote. ""This is part of who they are.”Those memories and feelings have value.“We have to make sense of it. That’s how you become a better leader,” Hutson said.Toughen them up. Workers with low resilience are twice as likely to quit their jobs within six months. Hardy workers, on the other hand, report 46% less stress than their counterparts.That’s according to a study commissioned by digital coaching firm meQuilibrium. “There’s a consistent and inverse relationship between resilience and stress,” said CEO Jan Bruce.The tougher you are mentally, the easier challenges appear.“Change your mind and you’ll change your life,” she said.Build brawn. The meQuilibrium mobile app assesses employees’ ability to cope, identifies where they fall short and provides exercises to help them toughen up.“You assess and diagnose problems and help the subject learn new skills,” Bruce said.The approach is therapeutic. “What we found is resilience can be learned. It’s not a personality type,” she said.Hand it over. Putting coaching into a mobile app makes it accessible.“You’ve got to have a solution that 100% of your employees can use,” said Bruce. “This is not new science, but it’s a new delivery.”Raise awareness. Bruce’s take-home lesson for individuals: “The problem with stress is not the stress itself. It’s the inability to cope with adversity.”Her message for companies: “Emotional wellness is a core component of their human capital continuum.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

Also, Entergy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 60.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, most of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters. This indicates reduced demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on Entergy's first-quarter sales.Moreover, management expects the company’s Entergy Wholesale Commodity (EWC) segment to post lower net revenues throughout 2018. The downside can be attributed to lower energy prices, increased non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses on account of higher projected nuclear spending. We believe the upcoming results to reflect this trend, which in turn, is likely to be a drag on the company’s total revenues. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion for Entergy’s first-quarter sales reflects a year-over-year decline of 5.1%.On the bottom-line front, corporate income tax expense courtesy of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is expected to boost Entergy’s earnings growth, in the first-quarter. Considering this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy’s first-quarter earnings of $1.31 per share reflects annual growth of 32.3%.In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills. So, a part of this $62 million will positively impact the company’s first quarter results.On the flip side, higher fuel costs are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s results in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The increase in fuel costs can be attributed to rise in nuclear spending that Entergy expects to incur in relation to its nuclear strategic plan like continuing operation of the Palisades plant through 2022.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Entergy has an Earnings ESP of -0.96%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the possibility of an earnings beat. However, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few operators in the Utility space that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:CMS Energy (CMS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2.

39,ETR,"Alliant Energy Corp (LNT  -  Free Report) received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to add 1,000 megawatts (MW) wind energy in Iowa by 2020. The company is planning to invest $1.8 billion to boost renewable energy, which can serve approximately 430,000 homes.In 2016, Alliant Energy received approval to add up to 500 MW of wind energy. Currently, Alliant Energy owns and operates four wind firms in the state, while it purchased power from other generators. The company has the capability to serve clean energy to 215,000 homes, which is expected to double once the wind generation assets commence operation.Rising Popularity of Wind EnergyIn the last few years, growth in the U.S. renewable energy industry was influenced by initiatives from the state and federal governments. Energy generation from traditional sources is being replaced by alternative sources — solar, wind, hydro etc. Courtesy of advancements in technology, costs of energy production from renewable sources are lowering. Declining cost and emission-less production are the primary reasons for increasing popularity of renewable sources.Per a recent report by Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), production from wind energy will increase in the near future. EIA expects wind energy to provide 6.4% and 6.9% of total utility-scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019, respectively, up from 6.3% in 2017. With increasing asset installation, EIA expects wind to surpass hydro as the major source of renewable electricity generation.Price PerformanceAlliant Energy’s shares have rallied 8.5% in the last 12 months compared with 2.2% rise of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlliant Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors can consider better-ranked stocks from the same space such as CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), Entergy Corporation ETR  and PNM Resources (PNM  -  Free Report).

41,ETR,"Entergy Corp.’s (ETR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans, has recently received the New Orleans City Council’s approval to construct a natural-gas fired power plant in the city. Notably, this latest development is in sync with the company’s efforts to include renewable energy in its generation resource portfolio for diversification.About the Plant The New Orleans power station, composed of seven natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, comes with an electricity generation capacity worth 128 megawatt (MW). Entergy expects the plant to commence its services by January 2020.Entergy will invest $210 million in this project, which includes transmission and other project-related costs and contingency. Moreover, it expects to issue a full notice to proceed to the engineering, procurement and construction contractor by end of March 2018.Impressively, the reciprocating engines installed in this plant have self-start capability, thus enabling the company to start the unit even when there is no power on the electric grid. These engines will also help in grid stability and storm restoration by providing a local source of power generation. Markedly, the New Orleans Power Station will use minimal groundwater.Economic Benefits of the PlantApart from generating clean energy, the power plant will help in boosting New Orleans’ economic development. According to Louisiana economist, Dr. Loren Scott, the plant's construction phase will generate new business sales worth $206 million in Orleans Parish and new household earnings worth more than $28 million in for parish residents.Moreover, during the construction, an average of 92 people will get employment per year while the Orleans Parish treasury will gain approximately $1 million in the form of new sales taxes into. On completion, the plant will employ approximately 20 people.Our ViewAfter realizing the fact that alternative energy sources like solar, wind and natural gas are important for future, many electric utilities have started restructuring their generation resource portfolio to include renewable energy. In this context, Entergy is no exception. In fact, we believe the New Orleans power plant is part of the company’s commitment toward pursuing up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve its New Orleans customers, which account for more than 20,000 individuals.Notably, retail sales of electricity in Louisiana, the state in which New Orleans resides, are among the highest in the United States.  Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report,  total renewables used in the electric power sector are projected to increase 41% in 2018.  Naturally, electricity providers will try to make most of this opportunity and enhance their renewable resource portfolio in this state. Therefore, in line with this, the construction of the natural-gas fired power plant seems to be a strategically efficient decision by Entergy.Furthermore, with Louisiana being one of the top five natural gas-producing states in the country, the New Orleans plant is expected to never run out of natural-gas reserve. This will allow Entergy to cater to the growing demand for electricity in the city and in turn boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Entergy’s shares have gained 4.2% against the broader industry’s decline of 3.7%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined investment in growth projects for the modernization of grid along with evolving customer demand and regulatory support to recover investments. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEntergy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), Exelon (EXC  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report).

43,ETR,"Duke Energy’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary Duke Energy Progress recently proposed to increase electricity rates for customers residing in North Carolina. If approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, residential customers will have to pay an additional $5.22 a month for availing services.Details of the Rate HikePer the terms of the proposal, the company aims to hike electric rates by 4.7% in the first four years and an additional 1.3% thereafter. As a result, the annualized bill for a residential customer will increase from the current rate of $10.8.27 per month to $113.49. This hike will also include an increase in the basic customer charge from $11.13 to $14.00 per month.The average net rate increase for the first four years will be 6.2% for residential customers, 5.1 % for the small general service group, 3.1 % for medium general service group and 3.6% for large general service group. After the fourth year, the rates are expected to change to 7.3% for the residential customer group, 6.1 % for the small general service group, 4.7 % for medium general service group and 5.6% for large general service group.Our ViewThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of investing in and generating cleaner electricity by responsibly managing coal ash and improving energy reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Usually, utility providers like Duke Energy files for rate increase to recover costs of investment and thereby extend operations and provide better services. The tax reform implemented by the U.S. government last December, set the stage for this utility’s increased rate base. Notably, lower tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation resulting in lower deferred taxes increases the rate base. As a result, the company expects to witness higher rate base growth for the same level of capital it earlier used to spend, thereby resulting in substantial earnings growth.Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $30 billion in electric utilities and infrastructural growth projects over the 2018-2022 time frame supports this notion. Webelieve such rate base increase, which in turn leads to notable earnings growth, will allow the company to duly achieve its long-term investment targets.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 7.9% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.   Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry include CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), all of them carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

48,ETR,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.31%. Moreover, Entergy Corp. outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 85.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMost of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters during the quarter under review. This has lowered demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on the company’s fourth-quarter sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy Corp.’s fourth-quarter sales of $2.33 billion marks a year-over-year decline of 12.2%.In October 2017, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the recovery of nuclear dry fuel storage costs incurred by Entergy Corp. earlier. The move is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. Our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 35.5%.Moreover, during the fourth quarter, Entergy Corp. raised its quarterly dividend by 2.3% to 89 cents per share. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities for the company which we believe will drive its fourth-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Entergy Corp. has an Earnings ESP of -2.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few operators in the utility space that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.44% and a Zacks Rank #3.

49,ETR,"We expect Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectation when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 0.06%.Why a Likely Positive SurpriseOur proven model shows that Consolidated Edison is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Consolidated Edison possesses both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Consolidated Edison has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Consolidated Edison currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP increases the chance of surprise prediction.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisionsFactors at PlayOf late Consolidated Edison has been incorporating renewable energy in its grid at an increasing rate. As a result, its third-quarter results reflected higher revenues from renewable electric production projects. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to reflect the same.Consolidated Edison’s regulated based utilities provide it with a stable earnings base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings of 78 cents per share reflects an improvement of 13% year over year.Moreover, the company's service territories witnessed colder-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This is likely to result in higher household expenditure on heating and, in turn, will most likely boost the revenues for this energy provider. Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Consolidated Edison Inc Quote Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the Zacks Utility sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource (NI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.

50,ETR,"Even though the northern part of the United States usually experiences extreme climatic conditions during winter, this year has been especially harsh owing to a snowy nor'easter ""bomb cyclone."" The cyclone hit the coasts of Florida and Southeast United States on Jan 3, and South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey the next day.The bitter cold wave enveloped the entire East Coast as well as the MidWest of the United States, causing heavy snowfall in the East Coast from Maine to North Carolina (as per Reuters), resulting in wide-spread power cuts. Extensive outages were reported in these regions, which might have led the broader Utility sector’s performance to dip. Evidently, the Utility sector dropped 1.4% since the beginning of 2018.Impact on the EconomyBomb cyclone spurred heating oil and natural gas demand in turn raising their price. Per The New York Times report, the cost of residential heating oil at the end of December 2017 surged 13% to $2.92 a gallon, compared with the same period in 2016.Being the major residential and commercial heating fuel in the Northeast and most widely used by power plants, U.S. natural gas demand also remained near record highs last week. Consequently, U.S. spot natural gas and power prices on Jan 4 rose to their highest in years in several regions (as per Reuters).The catastrophic back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 in the United States have already led to a damage of $306 billion. The extreme winter storm and the cold waves, expected to continue for a while per the National Weather service, along with other catastrophes that usually take place each year, are likely to result in similar if not more damage.Impact on UtilitiesThe severe storm followed by heavy snowfall and high winds initially caused electricity outages in almost 80,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. Atlantic coast. Power outages have also hit thousands of customers in Florida and the Southeast.Per a North American Electric Reliability Council report, plants in the Southern part of the United States suffered outages, as they weren't designed to operate at such low temperatures. Meanwhile, outages at coal-fired facilities and problems delivering natural gas to plants in the 13-state region that includes Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also affected the system adversely.Although the storm dented electric utility services at varied parts of the nation, none of the major utilities reported any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to their advanced infrastructural development. In fact, utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some customers who were hit by the storm overnight.However natural gas pipeline constraints in the Northeast have been posing challenges to the grid operator. Currently, natural gas accounts for about one-third of U.S. power generation, roughly on par with coal. However, there is significant opposition to new pipeline construction in the densely populated Northeast, which sits just above the major natural gas-producing region in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.This becomes an issue during cold snaps, when residences that rely on natural gas for home heating, compete for supplies with power plants. Therefore, utility service providers in this region are expected to suffer a big blow from this storm.3 Utilities to WatchDuring the bomb cyclone, utility providers in the nation tried their best to restore the system. However, depending on the extent of the damage as well as severity of weather conditions prevalent in the outage sites, complete restoration was not possible. This may have led the below mentioned utilities to suffer in the equity market immediately following the devastating storm.Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thousands of Duke Energy customers in North and South Carolina suffered power cuts over the week (according to the utility’s online outage tracker). The company appealed to customers to lower their energy use citing extreme cold temperatures that can put pressure on their electricity system.The company’s share price dropped 3.4% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report): This company transmits and delivers electricity and natural gas. It also carries a Zacks Rank #3.High population creates problem for new pipeline construction for natural gas in New England, wherein natural gas accounted for half of the region’s electric power in 2016. National Fuel warned that it expects outages in New England that could take multiple days to restore. With Eversource being the largest energy provider in the region, the storm has affected its share price.The company’s share price dropped 2.2% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Entergy Corp. (ETR  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3.The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp, which operates the Pilgrim Station, has not yet said when the station will restart.The company’s share price dropped 1.6% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.To Sum UpIn general, extreme weather conditions provide an impetus to utility services demand which in turn raise utility bills. Therefore, utility providers should have gained in the United States, following the terrific snowy storm. However, the share price performance of the stocks shows a different picture.Nevertheless, the increased utility bills that consumers have already paid, relative to the peak demand at the time of this storm, can be expected to get reflected in the improved Q1 results for these utilities as well as others. Further, once weather conditions starts to improve from the second half of January, as expected by weather reports, these utilities will be able to restore the outages full-fledged, post which their share price may take a positive rebound. In fact, each of them carrying a Zacks Rank #3 is a further indication that these stocks are worth adding in your watchlist.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

51,ETR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report)stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Entergy Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Entergy Corporation’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Entergy Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 16.1, which is much higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Entergy Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Entergy Corporation currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Entergy Corporation a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Entergy Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C. This gives ETR a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 2.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus | Entergy Corporation Quote The stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEntergy Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 24% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

68,ETR,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Entergy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ETR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.15 per share for ETR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ETR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.01% heading into earnings season.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ETR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Entergy, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

69,ETR,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power, is scheduled to report its financial results on Oct 24, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +3.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.25, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.16. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Now, the factors influencing Entergy's quarterly results are elaborated below.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that there were non-recurring items in 2016 that will lead to a decline of 5 cents in its third-quarter earnings.The company also expects to continue witnessing higher nuclear spending that will increase staffing levels to be consistent with industry norms and execute on projects resultantly improving the reliability. This, in turn, is expected to decrease earnings about 20 cents in the second half of the year, about two thirds of which will be in the third quarter.Apart from this, other non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses are expected to deteriorate third-quarter earnings by 10 cents. Overall, the performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be poor compared with the year-ago quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter’s earnings moved down 6.5%.On the brighter note, this New Orleans, LA-based company’s service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line. May be that’s why our Consensus Estimate called for revenues of $3.13 billion in the third quarter, implying a year-over-year increase of 0.1%, for Entergy.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.

70,ETR,"With the Q3 earnings season kicking off, Utility companies are preparing to release their numbers in the next couple of weeks. Notably, the Zacks Utility sector gained 3% in the third quarter.Factors Boosting the UtilitiesA major factor which boosts the utility sector is that there exists no substitute for the energy-related services rendered by the utilities. The endless demand for electricity and utility services will never cease to exist, thereby conferring a consistent flow of revenue to these companies. Thus utilities are considered as a safe haven.Utilities generate more or less stable earnings unless any sudden event impacts their operations adversely. This regulated nature of operations provide them stability and in turn they reward their shareholders with steady dividend rates.Moreover, the predominant domestic focus shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues. Also the major utility providers make frequent modernizations of their grid system and distribution networks to offer seamless flow of electricity to customers. In fact, it is these modernization initiatives that saved the grid systems from getting severely damaged from the widespread hurricane rampage that hit the coastal U.S. in the last couple of months.Further, stringent emission regulations implemented by Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although it is a favorable development from the environmental point of view, utilities had to make huge investments to ease the transition to renewables.However, President Trump’s recent initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan on economic growth grounds is expected to give a temporary breather to utilities that produce major part of their electricity from coal.On the other hand, realizing the need for clean energy a number of major utility providers like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) have already taken initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources. Considering the fact that renewable energy is the ultimate future of energy resources, these initiatives will boost the growth of alternative-energy utilities, in the long run.We believe, over time, a constructive utility-rate environment and increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewable sources will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.Earnings Expectations for UtilitiesPer our Earnings Trend, as of Oct 11, Q3 earnings for the Utility sector is expected to be down 2.9%, while sales for the same is estimated to be up by 1.5%. Operations of major utilities like NextEra, Duke Energy and American Electric Power Corporation (AEP  -  Free Report) that have extensive business in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida were affected adversely. Although a minor section of their grid system got damaged severely, they were compelled to stall electricity distribution. These outages are expected to weigh on their Q3 earnings, which in turn may have dragged down this sector’s overall earnings expectation for the quarter.Nevertheless, going ahead, in 2017, this sector is expected to exhibit an earnings improvement of 2.1% and sales growth of 4.4%. This indicates an improvement in the results of these stocks ahead of Q3.How to Identify Potential Winners Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Moreover, investors constantly seek stocks that not only maintain stability but produce respectable returns for shareholders. Keeping that in mind, we have herein added Return on Equity (ROE) in our selection criteria for screening high cash returning utility stocks that are poised to beat Q3 earnings.5 Solid Bets Here are five utility stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises, with a ROE greater than 10%, in their upcoming announcements:BCE, Inc.

72,ETR,"In one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years -- Hurricane Harvey -- the city of Houston was the worst hit. The storm ravaged through the city causing widespread damage to properties as well as human lives. Catastrophic flooding further added to the woes.Among the 16 sectors in our Zacks Coverage Universe, Energy and Insurance sectors have lost the most. In addition, Utility sector also suffered since catastrophic flooding affected transmission lines in many regions of the state, forcing thousands to deal with power cuts.Harvey’s Effect in TexasAccording to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the impact of Harvey was far greater than that of Hurricane Katrina, which affected New Orleans in 2005.The U.S. government requested Congress for an aid of $7.85 billion for rescue operations in Texas and Louisiana. However, Governor Abbott, in his latest interview to BBC News, claimed that Texas will need an assistance of $180 billion to recuperate from the loss. Notably this is higher than his earlier provided estimate of $125 billion worth aid.Harvey’s Impact on UtilitiesPer the latest report provided by the Electric Reliablity Council of Texas (ERCOT), as of Sep 1, certain areas in the state of Texas will continue to experience outages due to Harvey. This is because two major 345-kV transmission lines in the state are still out of service, including the one in Houston.Moreover, about 7,500 MW of generation resource capacity remains unavailable or is operating at reduced capacity.According to ERCOT’s report, none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to advanced infrastructural development. However, most of their customers suffered significant power outages, which in turn may impact their third-quarter bottom-line results.Although, utility providers are trying their best to restore the system, it is difficult to exactly forecast the time of full restoration as it depends on the extent of damage and location of the outage. Moreover, continued flooding is likely to delay restoration in many areas and lead to new outages.Naturally, electricty flow from utility providers that operate in Texas suffered extensively due to this category 4 hurricane, which had earlier been predicted to be a category 3 storm.Utilities Hit by HarveyConsidering the fact that Houston is the fourth most populous city of the United States, demand for electricity is also high. Coming to the state’s statistics, Texas is the second-largest economy among the U.S. states and is the largest electricity consumer, as per latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This made the state a well desired abode for utility players to expand their business.However, Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages and are expected to affect the growth of the following three utilities.American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report): AEP Texas, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers in west, central and southern Texas. It encompasses the AEP service territory in the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 0.8%, following the impact of Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report): Houston Electric, a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy,engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area including the city of Houston. It is also a member of the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 1% due to Harvey’s impact. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report): Entergy Texas, a subsidiary of Entergy Corp., engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas.The company’s shares have declined 1% owing to Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Bottom LineHarvey not only destroyed properties in Texas but also left an indelible mark on the lives of many. However, no one can deny the fact that the enormous investments which Utilities have been making in infrastructural developments to upgrade their transmission lines and grid system have paid well during this period of crisis. Thus it can be said that though Harvey had been one of the worst storms to affect America in the recent past, the damages that occurred to the grids and transmission lines were not equally extensive.However, owing to safety issues distributors snapped electricity in flooded areas resulting in prolonged outages. Though the operating profits of the utility providers are likely to be impacted by the move, the extent of the same would have been much higher had the grid system been affected.

73,ETR,"We issued an updated research report on Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) on Aug 29. Of late, Entergy is gradually shifting from being a hybrid to a pure-play utility.The company began this process by closing Vermont Yankee power plant in 2014. Going forward, it plans to shut down its Palisades power plant in October 2018 and its Pilgrim plant in May 2019. In April 2020 and 2021, the company plans to close Indian Point Units 2 and 3. The company aims to increase investments toward the modernization of grid buoyed by rising customer demand and favorable regulatory support.Of the recently made investments, in April 2017, the company signed a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation. Per the deal, Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 360 MW. Once completed in 2021, Entergy will purchase the plant for $261 million.To diminish the risk and volatility in the EWC business, the company is gradually reducing its EWC footprint. In line with this, the EWC earned 10.2% less net income in second-quarter 2017 for the company compared to the prior-year quarter’s level.On the flip side, higher nuclear labor costs are hampering the company’s operational growth, which in turn is escalating its nuclear generation expense. Moreover, Entergy recently witnessed lower generation from its nuclear plants, primarily due to an increase in outage days and lower fuel expense which resulted from impairments.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, Entergy’s share price has gained 2.8% in the last one year, compared to its broader industry's gain of 8%.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report).Zacks RankEntergy Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

74,ETR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Entergy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.53. This level compares considerably favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.13.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Entergy’s current PE near its median (which stands at 11.46) over the observed period. Notably, the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period, suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility – Electric Power industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.06. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Entergy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.94 – that is lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Entergy stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Entergy has a P/S ratio of about 1.27. This is lower than the Zacks categorized Utility – Electric Power industry average, which comes in at 1.40 right now. Notably, the stock has always traded below the industry average P/S level, over the observed period. ETR is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Entergy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Entergy an apt choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/B ratio (used to compare a stock's market value to its book value) stands at 1.65, lower than the industry average of 1.74. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.02, which is far better than the industry average of 8.37. Clearly, ETR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Entergy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘F’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives ETR a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘C’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past month, while the full year estimate has jumped up 44%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus | Entergy Corporation QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Entergy is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineEntergy is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 42% out of 265 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.Entergy is gradually shifting from a hybrid model to a pure-play utility, which is expected to drive growth. Going forward, the company plans to make investments for the modernization of grid with evolving customer demand. Also, the company maintains a stable liquidity position that enables it to make notable investment plans.  Moreover, to pursue growth opportunities in the generation business, the company has a strong project pipeline.However, Entergy's low interest rate phase prevailing over the past few years have affected the company’s pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Again, any adverse decision in pending regulatory cases can materially impact its earnings. Moreover, price fluctuations in wholesale power markets could be a growth deterrent.Nevertheless, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics make this stock a compelling pick.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

81,ETR,"The Q2 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. As of Jul 28, 286 S&P 500 members came up with quarterly earnings. Total earnings are up 11.3% from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues. 74.5% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.Nearly 1000 companies – including 130 S&P 500 members – are expected to come up with results this week. Combining the results of the reported index members (286 members till Jul 28) with the remaining 214 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5.0% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Initially, when the season started, we expected earnings to drop 2.9%. However, as the season gradually unfolds, we expect utility earnings to drop 1.8%.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

83,ETR,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 2, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 6.60%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged slightly lower at $1.20. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that it expects continued growth in industrial sales in 2017 driven by new and expansion projects. Consequently, it is expected that industrial sales will witness growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, the company's service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line.On the flip side, Entergy had earlier said that in the first half of 2017 sales at the existing petroleum refiners are projected to decline year over year due to anticipated customer outages. This, in turn, will negatively impact the company’s second-quarter results.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 61.3%, on revenues of $2.44 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 0.8%.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource, Inc.
