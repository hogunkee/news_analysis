1,PLD,"Real estate funds have been making a comeback since tumbling to recent lows. In fact, several are near potential buy points.Why? Most of these ETFs hold real estate investment trusts (REITs), high-yielding securities which tend to do better when interest rates are low.

But they're getting back in as rates have slipped below 3% again.The $32 billion Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) is in buy range from an 80.87 entry of a cup with handle. While shares are near a 52-week high, they are still about 11% below their August 2016 peak.Specialized REITs accounted for the biggest sector weight in the fund as of May 31, at about 27% of assets.

3,PLD,"Stocks in the REIT Leaders screen rarely make major moves, unless something happens that rocks the industry. That's exactly why Gramercy Property Trust (GPT), a key player in the warehouse REIT field, showed unusual action as it soared 15% Monday.The real estate investment trust agreed to a buyout offer from Blackstone Group (BX) that's valued at $7.6 billion.

10,PLD,"The stock market managed modest gains Monday, although the Nasdaq closed in the bottom half of its intraday range for the fourth straight session. Similar to the Dow and the 20,000 level, the 5,500 level for the Nasdaq has been a tough nut to crack. The fact that the Dow and Nasdaq are seeing some selling pressure at these round…

11,PLD,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

13,PLD,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

73,PLD,"After shunning real estate investment trusts last year, investors are rebuilding their positions in companies that buy and rent real estate.REIT ETFs have been among the few sectors beating the stock market so far this year. Vanguard REIT Index (VNQ), the largest in its category with $22 billion in assets, has jumped 11% year-to-date, far surpassing the SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 1% gain. It's a remarkable turnaround after adding only 2% when SPY popped 32% in 2013.IShares Residential Real Estate (REZ) has also vaulted 13% year-to-date, while IShares Cohen & Steers REIT (ICF) is up 12%.Investors have been flocking to income-generating assets as interest rates fell this year despite the Federal Reserve's plan to scale back its unprecedented economic stimulus, which was expected to lift interest rates. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes are down 28 basis points so far this year to 2.72% as of Wednesday from 3.00% at the start of the year.""The average public REIT has a yield of 3.5% — much better than other alternatives and more sustainable if the economy does recover from its current anemia,"" Christian Wagner, CEO of Longview Capital Management in Wilmington, Del., said in an email. ""Builders continue to bring more product online due to low costs of funds. And in the event that we do have a significant upturn, their inventory will be sufficient to fulfill demand.""VNQ currently shows a 12-month yield of 2.9%, REZ 3.6% and ICF 3.2%, according to Morningstar. Among the biggest holdings in VNQ, Simon Property Group (SPG) is up 10% this year, Public Storage (PSA) 13% and Prologis (PLD) 12%. Top gainers among VNQ's 131 names are Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT), up 28%, and Camden Property Trust (CPT), up 20%. They each account for less than 0.5% of VNQ's assets.REITs such as Simon, which invest in shopping centers and retail locations, should benefit from rising consumer spending and retail sales anticipated over the next year, says Robert McMillan, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.""Most of the retail REITs have long-term leases with their customers, with embedded rent adjustments that should help insulate them from economic fluctuations,"" he wrote in an equity report April 5.""We expect tight credit conditions, though not as restrictive as they were at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008 and 2009, to continue to squeeze smaller, undercapitalized players from the market as larger retailers seek to do business with shopping -center operators that can execute in a still tight and volatile credit environment.""Although REITs are heavily indebted, their mortgages are secured by the underlying properties — which makes lenders amiable to refinancing the debts, McMillan added. But traditional brick-and-mortar stores could suffer if online shopping continues to win over customers. Retail landlords would have to focus on expanding overseas, which entails more risks, wrote Todd Lukasik, an analyst with Morningstar, in a report dated April 8.Rate-Rise RiskReal estate ETFs have absorbed $2.25 billion year -to-date after taking in $3.21 billion last year, according to ETF.com. Should interest rates start to rise, investor inflow into REITs may reverse and lower their stock prices.IHS Global Insight economist Paul Edelstein expects the Fed to lift rates in September 2015 upon reviewing the Fed's minutes from the March 18-19 meeting, which ""offered little new information.""

74,PLD,"Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has sold an industrial building in Hialeah, FL, on Jun 25, 2018. The property has been sold for approximately $24.3 million. Through this sale, Terreno recognized an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 11.5%.The property is situated at 215 SE 10th Avenue, on approximately 10.5 acres. It consists of an industrial distribution building, spanning around 302,000 square feet. It is 100% leased to a single tenant. The company shelled out nearly $9 million to purchase this property on Dec 20, 2010.Notably, a recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment have led to the rise in demand for the industrial real estates. This is offering significant scope to industrial real estate investment trusts (REIT), like Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) and Terreno to flourish.Amid these, Terreno remains well poised to capitalize on robust industry fundamentals by making selective dispositions and strategic acquisitions. In fact, selective dispositions would help the company unlock value and redeploy the sale proceeds in acquiring high-yielding assets. Specifically, Terreno targets functional buildings at in-fill locations, with high population density and which are situated near high volume-distribution points. The company is currently fortifying its portfolio in six major port cities — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, D.C. — which depict solid demographic trends and have strong barriers to entry that limit new supply.In fact, on May 7, the company shelled out $6 million to purchase an industrial property in Renton, WA. In addition, on May 4, it acquired another industrial property in Newark, NJ, for $6.3 million. Further, Terreno acquired three industrial properties in the first quarter of 2018.Moreover, the company’s acquisition activities in 2017 included 23 industrial properties, comprising 35 buildings, with around 1.7 million square feet, and five improved land parcels, aggregating around 25.1 acres for $292.7 million. On the other hand, during 2017, the company’s dispositions comprised four properties sold at a sales price of around $77.3 million, producing an unleveraged internal rate of return of 13.7%.Encouragingly, over the past six months, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has rallied 6.7%, the industry has declined 1.7% during this period.Terreno currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

75,PLD,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has started developing Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 — a 284,865-square-foot bulk warehouse in Fairfield. The move comes as part of the company’s concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market.The new building, situated on the Seward Road close to its intersection with Tylersville Road and in proximity to a number of Duke Realty industrial properties in the Cincinnati metro area, will likely be delivered in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be accessible through multiple routes and is within five miles of both I-75 and I-275.Having considerable access to highways, the construction of this building on a speculative basis, which will provide modern warehouse space for users with immediate needs, is a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Cincinnati metro area enjoys a central location which offers distributors the scope to reach a bulk of the U.S. population in a one-day drive. Duke Realty already has a robust presence in the region, with several of its properties, including Union Centre Industrial Park in West Chester, and its existing portfolio has at or near 100% occupancy.In fact, with Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 being located in the TriCounty submarket and enjoying highway accessibility, it is likely to be a preferred choice for companies seeking last-mile delivery facilities.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Specifically, Duke Realty has resorted to sale of suburban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 10.3% in the past three months, outperforming 6.2% growth recorded by its industry.

78,PLD,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) reported an in-line result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Though the company experienced improved operating environment in the quarter, it did not recognize any promote income.However, Prologis has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and met in the other two, over the preceding four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 2.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 66 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, backed by the recovering economy and job-market improvements, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Amid this, Prologis has the capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The company also has solid balance-sheet strength. Also, its build-to-suit activity remained impressive in the second half of 2017, with the company completing 13 development projects. With a total expected investment (TEI) of approximately $350 million (on a Prologis-share basis), these projects included more than 4.7 million square feet of space.Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) was awarded 21 build-to-suit development projects during the same period, denoting over 6.7 million square feet of space. The TEI of these developments totaled roughly $550 million on a Prologis-share basis.In fact, for full-year 2017, the company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space. During the year, it also commenced 38 projects with a TEI of nearly $1.1 billion.Notably, this high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank as well as the sturdy network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. In fact, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and chances of any sound improvement in rent and occupancy growth in the to-be-reported quarter seem limited.Rather, there is intense competition in the market. Also, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to elevated supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $532 million, denoting a drop of 5% from the year-ago quarter.Therefore, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 66 cents per share over the past 30 days.Furthermore, Prologis has underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have dipped 4.6%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.3% during this time frame.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +0.10%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share. However, we also need to have a favorable Zacks rank to be confident of a positive surprise.Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 27, has an Earnings ESP of +1.34% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

79,PLD,"Prologis’ (PLD  -  Free Report) build-to-suit activity remained solid in the second half of 2017, with the company completing 13 development projects. With a total expected investment (TEI) of approximately $350 million, these projects included more than 4.7 million square feet of space.Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) was awarded 21 build-to-suit development projects during the same period, denoting over 6.7 million square feet of space. The TEI of these developments totaled approximately $550 million.In fact, for full-year 2017, the company completed 33 build-to-suit projects covering more than 12 million square feet of space. During the year, it also started 38 projects which have a TEI of nearly $1.1 billion.These comprise 47% of the company’s total development TEI for 2017 and indicate an increase of more than 45% as compared to the prior year’s TEI for build-to-suit projects.      Also, the company signed agreements for more than 70% of these starts with multi-site customers, while more than 95% of the customers are located in global markets.Notably, this high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank as well as the strong network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. In fact, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013.The industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, thanks to the rising Internet retailing and supply-chain consolidation. This, in turn, is generating greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks. While there is a rising demand for modern logistics facilities, with vacancy rates tightening, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be made available in the market the near term, leading to elevated supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have underperformed the industry over the past three months.

80,PLD,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Cousins Properties (CUZ  -  Free Report) recently announced an 8.3% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 6.5 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Apr 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Apr 3.Based on the increased rate for the first quarter of 2018, the annual dividend comes to 26 cents a share. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 2.98% based on the stock’s closing price of $8.70 on Mar 19.We believe Cousins Properties has adequate capacity to support its enhanced dividend payout. In February, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share of 15 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure compared favorably with 7 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Quarterly results at this real estate investment trust (REIT) reflected a rise in second-generation net rent per square foot on a cash basis.Notably, Cousins Properties’ diversified portfolio,  presence of high-end tenants in its roster, opportunistic investments in best sub-markets and a conservative balance sheet keeps the growth momentum going. As such, the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, the company faces stiff competition from other market players. This impacts its ability to retain and attract tenants at higher rents. Further, rising supply of office space and hike in interest rates remain concerns.In fact, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Cousins Properties, some other REITs, which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) and Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report).Cousins Properties' shares have dropped 5% in the past three months, against the 5.4% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Cousins Properties currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

81,PLD,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) finally declared an increase in its first-quarter 2018 dividend. The company will now pay 54 cents for the quarter, which reflects a hike of 7.2% from the prior dividend of 50.375 cents.Notably, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced its decision to no longer fix the common share dividend as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized funds of operations (FFO). Rather, the company will embrace a more conventional policy that is based on actual and projected financial conditions, actual and projected liquidity and operating results, projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities. Therefore, with its development spend reduced substantially and solid growth in property operations, the company anticipates experiencing considerable increase in available cash flow in the near future.Based on the hiked rate of 54 cents for the quarter, the annual dividend comes to $2.16 per share. This new dividend will be paid on Apr 13, to shareholders of record on Mar 26, 2018. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 3.62% based on the stock’s closing price of $59.72 on Mar 15.The company also announced that its Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Jun 14, 2018 in Chicago, IL.  We believe Equity Residential has adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Later this January, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized FFO per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The figure also came in higher than 79 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly results at this apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) mirrored enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Notably, Equity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. It is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. As such, we believe the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, new apartment supply across Equity Residential’s markets might continue to put pressure on new lease rates, occupancy, retention and result in high concessions as well. Furthermore, rate hike remains another concern.Notably, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Equity Residential, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Shares of Equity Residential have outperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past month.

82,PLD,"Delighting its shareholders, retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend. This is the company’s 96th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.95 cents per share compared with 21.90 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Apr 13 to shareholders on record as of Apr 2. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.634 per share versus the prior rate of $2.628 per share.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The April 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 573 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 82 consecutive quarterly increases as well as payment of more than $5.3 billion.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Apart from Realty Income, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Realty Income is well poised to grow and reward shareholders backed by its superior business model. This freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, its occupancy level has never been below 96%. For 2018 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 4.4% while the industry inched up 0.6% during this time frame.

83,PLD,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) is witnessing decent demand for its distribution facilities from new tenants. The company recently signed a lease with Best Buy Company Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) to rent 57,120 square feet at Liberty Ridge Business Park in Durham, NC.Best Buy intends to use this distribution facility as a home-delivery center for large appliances. Best Buy’s distribution facility is likely to open this summer. Per Best Buy, this location will aid the company in serving customers in a more organized and efficient manner.The building is located at 1955 T.W. Alexander Drive and is a part of the 36-acre industrial park, which includes 457,500 square feet of industrial facilities. Notably, Liberty Ridge is conveniently situated in T.W. Alexander Drive, between Page Road and Miami Boulevard. Thus, enabling easy access to Interstate 40 along with Highway 147 and Highway 70. Moreover, Raleigh-Durham International Airport is close to this industrial park. Hence, the strategic location of the property offers easy access to its tenants.This Class A, LEED® certified building has a height of 36 feet and depth of 210 feet. Further, the building is designed to offer sufficient space for truck loading and storage.The company’s focus on industrial space bodes well, amid high demand. In fact, the industrial real estate market has been experiencing elevated demand and solid rent growth on the back of an e-commerce boom, and supply-chain strategy transformations.This is offering significant impetus to industrial real estate investment trusts like Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report), Liberty Propertyand DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Encouragingly, shares of Liberty Property have outperformed its industry over the past six months, rising 3.4% against the industry’s decline of 2.4%.Currently, Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

84,PLD,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has clinched a lease deal with a furniture delivery and fulfillment service company — Metropolitan Warehouse & Delivery — for ePort 960. This facility is the company’s 220,200-square-foot warehouse property at 960 High Street in Perth Amboy.With this lease deal for the whole building, Duke Realty has achieved full occupancy for its New Jersey in-service portfolio. This highlights the elevated demand for modern warehouse properties closer to the New York metropolitan area, and reflects Duke Realty’s solid capacity to leverage on the favorable trend. Particularly, the ePort 960 property is well suited for last-mile fulfilment operations.ePort 960 was added to Duke Realty’s portfolio last year as part of its 3.1-million-square-foot New Jersey industrial portfolio acquisition, which comprised six buildings, as well as two development sites situated along the I-95 corridor. Further, the 960 High Street property is among the three new industrial buildings, which are together referred as the ePort Logistics Center owned by Duke Realty in Perth Amboy.Notably, of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Moreover, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Specifically, it should be noted that Duke Realty has resorted to sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. The company already has 5.7 million square feet of industrial properties in its New Jersey portfolio besides having properties in other key markets. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 9.1% in the past three months, outperforming 4.2% growth recorded by its industry.

85,PLD,"When a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve, investors in the REIT space are usually skittish because of the sector’s dependence on debt and the investment world treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature. There was no exception this time too and the REIT industry went into red, when the much anticipated rate hike occurred this time.However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter percentage point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting and brooding too much on the indication of two more hikes later this year, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018. More good news is a positive revision in projected inflation and a slash in the Fed’s forecast for unemployment.Such an environment can be far more rewarding for the REITs business, which usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? With one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector get a boost as growth in the economy and job market translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs to flourish.In fact, in recent years, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Lodging/Resorts REITs too are in the favorable bunch as an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal brighter prospects for these REITs.4 Stocks to Scoop Big GainsHere we have handpicked four REIT stocks from the above-mentioned asset categories that sport a top Zacks Rank.

The company shelled out $143.3 million for the acquisition of this 1.1-million-square-foot multi-tenant industrial portfolio which comprises 19 buildings on 65 acres of land.The move has particularly strengthened PS Business Parks’ presence in the Springfield/Newington industrial sub-market. In fact, with the latest acquisitions and the company’s existing three industrial parks, aggregating 606,000 square feet of space, PS Business Parks currently enjoys a solid 11% submarket concentration.With PS Business Parks’ proven expertise, the previously owned properties have been enjoying historical average occupancy of 95% since 2000. This raises hopes for achieving higher occupancy of the latest acquired portfolio which is currently 76% occupied and offers scope for the company to make capital upgrades.Moreover, with the acquired portfolio being advantageously located in a densely populated region next to Fort Belvoir and south of the Pentagon, and having solid transportation access, demand for space is likely to escalate.In fact, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, in order to address a large customer base and urbanization, as well as support e-commerce business.

87,PLD,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition.Moreover, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. Also, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike due to shorter leasing periods.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. Recently, Public Storage announced the opening of a new self-storage facility in one of Seattle’s popular suburbs. Specifically, The Public Storage located at 16311 Meridian Ave E Puyallup, WA, will accommodate more than 1,200 storage spaces. Notably, Puyallup is witnessing an influx of new residents from Seattle who are looking for more affordable housing in Puyallup. Hence, a new storage facility amid high demand will likely enable the company to enjoy elevated occupancy.Since January 2016, 127 self-storage facilities have been acquired and developed by the company. Particularly, during 2017, the company acquired 22 self-storage facilities, comprising 1.4 million net rentable square feet, for $149.8 million. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, Public Storage acquired two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company was under contract to acquire three self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet of space, for $19 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for long-term growth.Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the first quarter. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.48 marked 4.6% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.37. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46. Results highlight improvement in net operating income from same-store and non-same-store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Additionally, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Furthermore, shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares increased 7.6%, while the industry reported growth of 5%. Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a favorable earnings outlook for the current year.However, supply has been high in a number of markets and this affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.The company has a significant development and refurbishment pipeline. In fact, as of Mar 31, 2018, it had several facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $381 million, as well as expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet), worth roughly $281 million.Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining $382 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months. Though this is encouraging, the substantial pipeline increases operational risks and exposes the company to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and failure to fulfill government requirements. Further, self-storage spaces are not usually pre-leased and new assets generally take time to generate yields.Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate space include Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

88,PLD,"Shares of Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have gained 10.8%, while the industry recorded 5% growth, during this time period.Notably, there are enough reasons to expect a solid upside for this self-storage REIT stock. Particularly, the earnings outlook and fundamentals of Extra Space Storage appear assertive enough to drive its stock higher in the near term.The company has been making concerted efforts to expand its business around large population centers and diversify geographically. Extra Space Storage has significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,523 in first-quarter 2018. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 456 in the reported quarter.Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. The company gained an elevated scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions, as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.As a result, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage REIT emerged as the second largest self-storage operator, as well as the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.In addition, the self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Extra Space Storage enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 27.9%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Additionally, the company’s current cash flow growth of 16.3% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%.Also, its Return on Equity (ROE) is 18.9% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 212% in dividend.Moreover, in May, ushering in good news for its shareholders, Extra Space Storage announced a 10.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 86 cents per share, up from 78 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 29, to shareholders of record as of Jun 15, 2018.  Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Furthermore, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership, and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a solid earnings outlook for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has witnessed 0.4% upward revision in a month’s time. Given its progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other similarly-ranked stocks in the real estate space like Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

89,PLD,"Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) recently boosted its financial position by closing an amended and refinanced secured revolving facility. The move offers greater flexibility to the company as it offers a $1,750-million senior secured loan and another $250-million term loan A.Amendments have been made in the funded term-loan component, as well as the revolving component of the credit facility.The restated loan has enabled the company to stretch debt maturities from June 2022 to June 2023.Notably, the company can withdraw funds in different currencies like U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other. Moreover, borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be used for general corporate purposes. The amended loan reduces the interest rate margins on the revolver and term loan by 25 basis points (bps). Depending on the company’s leverage ratio, currency used and type of loan opted, interest rate margins for the facility will be in the 25-175 bps band.  The decrease in interest rate is anticipated to reduce the company’s annualized interest expense significantly. The move will improve the company’s cash flow and alleviate its bottom-line pressure as well. This reduction will strengthen Iron Mountain’s balance sheet.Nonetheless, per the term loan B of the credit agreement, including terms-related maturity, amortization and interest rate will remain unchanged. The company has a $700-million term loan B under the existing credit agreement.The amendment, which boosts the company's financial flexibility and future investment activities, highlights lenders' confidence in the company. Extending maturities provide the company ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities and carrying out acquisition initiatives.In fact, as the company plans to grow its dividend by another 7% to $2.35 by 2018 and 4% annually beyond 2018, the refinancing will enable managing to meet these goals and reward shareholders with higher returns.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry in the past three months.

This reflects the company’s continued efforts to improve shareholder wealth.Per management, this hike is in sync with the Pasadena, CA-based REIT’s strategy of sharing growth in cash flows from operating activities with the stockholders, while also retaining a significant portion to reinvest in its strong development and redevelopment pipeline that comprises new Class A properties.

91,PLD,"Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too. However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a “strong” job market.This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents.More importantly, the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates. Take for example the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers’ business model.No doubt, this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories.In fact, right from the time we use our smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase, demand for REITs get a boost. This is because as we place our demand, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. So without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report) and data-center REITs such as Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty (COR  -  Free Report) and others.Moreover, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.Further, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) and others. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Therefore, instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news, tap the many novelties in the REIT sector. Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs, favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

93,PLD,"Industrial REIT Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report) continues its efforts to capitalize on the healthy fundamentals in the industrial markets through purchase of potential properties in core markets. As part of such moves, most recently, the company shelled out $25.2 million for the purchase of an industrial property in Woodside Queens, NY. This comes after the acquisition of an industrial property Torrance, CA, for $17.5 million on Jan 31.The recently-acquired property consists of one industrial distribution building, which following the conclusion of the revamp expected by the end of this year, will comprise approximately 83,000 square feet on around 3.7 acres. It is advantageously located next to the intersection of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway. It is situated nearly a mile away from the LaGuardia Airport at 1 Bulova Avenue. The property is 23% leased to one tenant on a short-term basis.Notably, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is offering scope to industrial REITs, including Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) and Terreno.In fact, Terreno remains well poised to capitalize on robust industry fundamentals as it has solid capacity to offer modern distribution properties. The company is aimed at boosting shareholders’ value through acquisition of industrial assets. It specifically targets functional buildings at in-fill locations which enjoy high population densities and are situated near high volume-distribution points.Particularly, Terreno is fortifying its portfolio in six major port cities — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C. — that depict solid demographic trends and have strong barriers to entry which limit new supply. Further, the company’s 2017 acquisition activity included 23 industrial properties comprising 35 buildings, with around 1.7 million square feet and five improved land parcels, aggregating around 25.1 acres for a total of $292.7 million.Moreover, concurrent with acquisitions, the company has been putting in concerted efforts to shed non-core properties in a bid to enhance its overall portfolio mix and provide capital for strategic acquisitions. Recently, it announced selling of an industrial property in Capitol Heights, MD, for approximately $20.3 million.In fact, during 2017, the company’s dispositions comprised four properties sold at a total price of around $77.3 million, producing an unleveraged internal rate of return of 13.7%. The company intends to redeploy the sale proceeds in acquiring high-yielding assets.However, currently Terreno carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The stock has depreciated 4.6% over the past six months, which is narrower than the 9.7% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

95,PLD,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, recently Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) announced that its board has approved an 8.6% hike in quarterly common stock cash dividend rate to $1.01 from the 93 cents paid earlier.The new dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 4.1%, considering Digital Realty' closing price of $98.20 on Mar 2.Notably, Digital Realty has a solid track record of enhancing shareholders’ wealth. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 hike marks the 13th consecutive year of increase.We believe Digital Realty has solid scope of generating steady growth in cash flow to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.55 which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52. The core FFO per share also came in higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.43. Results were supported by growth in revenues.With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to drive top-line growth.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Further, the company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.However, the company faces intense competition in the industry. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to continue in the upcoming period. Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, the company has a substantial debt burden. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Digital Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has depreciated 8.8% over the past year, outperforming the 9.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Digital Realty, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report).Note: Funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

(“RVI”) (Read more: DDR to Spin-Off Sellable Properties Into a New Company)The spin-off will be effected by distributing 100% shares of SpinCo to DDR common shareholders. The distribution is expected to take place on Jul 1, 2018, following which RVI will be managed by one or more subsidiaries of DDR as an independent publicly-traded company.   DDR shareholders, holding 10 common shares of DDR at the close of business on Jun 26, will receive one RVI common share. However, since fractional shares of RVI will not be distributed, DDR common shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares that would be entitled to receive from the distribution.The company filed RVI’s Registration Statement on Form 10 with the SEC on Jun 4, 2018. Also, prior to the distribution date, RVI is expected to receive approval for its common share listing under the ticker “RVI” on the NYSE.Prior to distribution, RVI common shares will be publicly traded through “when issued” trading, under the ticker symbol “RVI WI”. Regular trading of the company shares will commence from Jul 2, 2018.The split-up is seen as a business strategy to create two separate companies with distinct strategies. Post spin-off, DDR will own 236 properties exhibiting top-tier demographics, and offering maximum scope for growth and redevelopment. On the other hand, RVT is expected to liquidate its entire portfolio within two to three years in order to realize the private market values for the company’s properties which are currently discounted by public markets.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed its industry in the past six months.

97,PLD,"Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (MNR  -  Free Report) has shelled out nearly $33.7 million for the purchase of a new 362,942-square-foot industrial building at 6735 Trippel Road, Theodore, AL. Net-leased for 11 years to Amazon Fulfillment Service, this buyout marks the company’s second property leased to Amazon.The purchase of this industrial property, which is situated on around 31.27 acres, in the Mobile, AL MSA, is a strategic fit. This is because it will help Monmouth Real Estate capitalize on the growing demand for the Port of Mobile due to the completion of the Panama Canal expansion.Per the company, over the past years, shipping container growth at the U.S. East Coast ports is surpassing that of the West Coast ports. Moreover, with two interstate highway systems and five Class-1 railroads serving the port, industrial real estate assets in the region are likely to experience solid demand for space.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization.As such, industrial REITs are scaling new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.In addition, per a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc., Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) and others to flourish.Particularly, Monmouth Real Estate, with a portfolio of 109 properties spanning around 20.5 million rentable square feet of area, across 30 states, remains well poised to leverage on the favorable trend. Its focus on single tenant, net-leased industrial properties that are leased for long term to mainly investment-grade tenants augurs well for growth.Additionally, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry over the past three months.

Although the properties that are expected to be sold off have not been finalized yet, the value of the same, in aggregate, is likely to cross $2 billion, per the report.Notably, Host Hotels has a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen the company’s position in vibrant markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.Particularly, during first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of the 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa, for $1 billion.Moreover, during the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects, and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects. Also, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects, and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are likely to help the company enhance its portfolio quality and bolster revenues as well.Host Hotels is expected to benefit from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets and strategic capital-recycling program, going forward. Further, its productivity-improvement efforts are anticipated to drive the company’s performance over the long term. In addition, the company has a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity that augurs well for its growth endeavors.

It is 44% leased to a single tenant. The company shelled out nearly $18.1 million for the purchase of this property on May 13, 2014. Through this sale, Terreno recognized an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 6.9%.As a matter of fact, elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment are driving the fundamentals of the industrial real estate market, and offering scope to industrial real estate investment trusts (REIT), including Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) and Terreno.In fact, Terreno remains well poised to capitalize on robust industry fundamentals as it has solid capacity to offer modern distribution properties.

100,PLD,"Recently, Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. As a result, the company will now pay 48 cents per share as against 44 cents paid in the prior quarter.The new dividend will be paid on Mar 29 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 3.2%, considering Prologis' closing price of $59.94 on Feb 22.We believe Prologis has an adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO). It experienced solid operating results and higher net promote income. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy also remained at a record high.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been enjoying elevated demand for logistics infrastructure amid an e-commerce boom, recovering economy and job market, as well as healthy manufacturing environment. This has been providing Prologis ample scope to tap growth opportunities.In addition, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity remained solid in 2017. The company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space, in the year. It also started 38 projects, which have a total expected investment of nearly $1.1 billion, in 2017. Furthermore, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts achieved the highest level since 2013. This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank and the robust network of multi-site customers which is increasingly focusing on e-commerce.Prologis is also focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company continues to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion. In addition, for the full year, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x-4.6x. Given its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders accordingly.However, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth.

103,PLD,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Monday following a shift in investment from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields reached their best level since April 2014. Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined.Additionally, shares of tech giant Apple slumped during the day, which in turn led the tech-based index Nasdaq to post its second worst one-day drop in 2018. Further, both the S&P 500 and the Dow witnessed their biggest one-day drop on Monday since Sept 5, 2017.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.7%, or 180.19 points to close at 26,439.48.

On Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.661% to 2.695% on Monday, reaching its highest settlement since April 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1.2%, becoming one of the worst performing sectors of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Equinix, Inc. (REIT) (EQIX  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) declined 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively.

104,PLD,"Recently,Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced that it has agreed to sell 49.5% interests in the 666 Fifth Avenue Office Condominium to the company’s partner — the Kushner Companies. Notably, Vornado will continue to own the property’s retail arm — 666 Fifth Avenue Retail Condominium — which is leased to Tissot, Uniqlo and Hollister, and has 125 linear feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street.The sale contract, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, is scheduled to close in third-quarter 2018. However, the completion of the transaction cannot be assured.Kushner bought the Manhattan building in 2007, for a record price of $1.8 billion. However, as recession hit Kushner, the company eventually started selling its parts. As a result, in 2011, Vornado acquired 49.5% stake in the building for $80 million and concurrently participated in half of the building’s loan of $1.2 billion. This loan, on the 1.4 million-square-foot office tower, is due in February 2019.Vornado will receive net proceeds of $120 million from the above-mentioned asset disposition. The company expects to realize a gain of $134 million in its financial statement and a tax gain of $244 million. Proceeds from sale of this stake will be used to pay off Vornado’s mortgage loan on the property. The company will also receive $58 million from its share in the refinanced mortgage on the property.This deal is a strategic fit for Vornado as it will enable the company to reduce its debts and pay off near-term loans efficiently. It will also help improve the company’s financial position. In addition, the disposition aids the company to reduce asset concentration in the New York City. This bodes well as any deterioration in economy or a fall in real estate markets in the region might hurt the company’s financial performance and the value of its properties in the area.However, Vornado’s aggressive dispositions, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, are expected to have a near-term dilutive impact on earnings. In fact, the company has identified another $1 billion of assets, which, it expects to sell over the next several years.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed its industry in the past six months.

105,PLD,"REITs delivered an encouraging performance in November backed by increased shareholder activity in the retail real estate market. Moreover, decent performance from a number of other core sectors improved the overall market returns.Per data from REIT.com, total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index logged in a gain of 2.6% in the month, after reporting negative returns in the last two months — a 0.2% decline in October and 0.6% fall in September. However, the figure lagged the S&P 500’s total return of 3.1% for the month.Particularly, total returns of retail REITs recorded 7.3% growth in November which was driven by 9.3% increase of the mall REITs and 6.8% ascend of the shopping center REITs. This was triggered by Brookfield Property Partners' $15-billion takeover offer for GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report).Among the other core sectors, that reported decent performance, were industrial REITs which gained 3.1% and infrastructure REITs that logged in a return of 2.9% in the month. For the first 11 months of 2017 too, these sectors recorded strong performance, with returns from industrial REITs ascending 24% and the same for infrastructure REITs surging 36.5%. While returns from data-center REITs edged down 0.3% in November, the sector still managed to record a return of 30.9% in the first 11 months of the year.Over the past several quarters, a lot of issues have cropped up in the retail REIT market with consumers preferring online platforms over in-store purchases, resulting in store closures and retailers filing for bankruptcies. These have led to a decline in share prices of several major retail REITs, year to date. Nevertheless, the Brookfield Property bid for GGP was adequate to help the sector rebound. Further, solid earnings and leasing metrics indicate that the sector still has inherent strength and it seems that the price declines are overdone.Also, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories. Rather, these companies are expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such strategic measures are likely to boost traffic.On the other hand, the e-commerce boom and healthy manufacturing environment, along with the recovering economy and job market gains, have been escalating demand for industrial real estate space.In fact, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options, propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities. Also, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. This is opening up opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Currently, GGP, Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust and Liberty Property Trust carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition to the above, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure are driving demand for data-center REITs. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

107,PLD,"LibertyProperty Trust’s (LPT  -  Free Report) industrial facilities are not only grabbing attention from prospective tenants, but also experiencing decent demand from the existing ones.Liberty announced that it has struck two new leases as well as a renewal lease in the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Raleigh-Durham.

109,PLD,"Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report) has provided insights on its third-quarter operating, investment and capital markets activities.Terreno’s assets experienced solid demand for space on the back of improving fundamentals of industrial markets. This helped the company improve its leasing metrics on a year-over-year (y/y) basis.Specifically at third-quarter end, Terreno’s total portfolio was 96.7% leased, while its 10.2 million-square-foot same-store portfolio was 97.5% leased. Cash rents on new and renewed leases grew nearly 14.7% during the quarter, raising the tally for the year to 12.5%.However, sale of two fully-leased properties, covering around 448,000 square feet of space, resulted in a fall of occupancy rates compared to the previous quarter. These properties, situated in Maryland’s Baltimore/Washington D.C. corridor, were sold for $40.5 million. The company intends to redeploy the sale proceeds in the acquisition of high-yielding assets.On the acquisition front, Terreno added six industrial properties, spanning 258,000 square feet of space, and a 1.1-acre improved land parcel to its roster during the third quarter.

111,PLD,"A solid jobs report for the month of May has triggered chances of a rate hike this month by the Federal Reserve. However, investors in the REIT space can shrug off such issues. This is because even though REITs have traditionally depended on debt for their business and were considered as bond substitutes for the high and consistent dividend-paying nature making their short-term returns susceptible to rate moves, this time around, these companies seem to be better poised to brave the rising rate environment.In fact, over the years, REITs have shored up capital and made concerted efforts to reduce leverage. These have resorted to equity capital rather than brooding too much on debt capital to finance their portfolio and carry on their business. Moreover, the healthy economy serves as a positive catalyst for demand for many of the asset categories.Also, the returns for May indicate the abating of the rate hike concerns. In fact, REITs delivered an encouraging performance in the month, as well as outperformed the broader market in the month. Per the data from REIT.com, total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index logged in a gain of 3.5% in the month, while the S&P 500 rose 2.4%.Lodging REITs ruled the market in May, with returns from this sector shooting up to 11.9%. Obviously, the news of Blackstone Group LP’s plan to acquire LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report), in a $4.8-billion all-cash deal, served as a tailwind and pulled in the attention of investors to this sector. Also, healthcare REITs gained 7.5%, while freestanding retail REIT reported 6.7% increase in returns, as earnings were comparatively better than what was apprehended.Notably, after lackluster performance in the first two months of 2018, the U.S. REIT industry has been gaining solid ground. Returns rebounded in March and were in the positive territory in April as well. In fact, the mojo seems to be back in the market, following the steady performance of REITs in Q1.Per the latest NAREIT media release, the Q1 scorecard revealed that funds from operations (FFO) totaled $15.3 billion, denoting a 3.6% increase on a sequential basis and growth of 6%, year over year. Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 2.5% year over year. Occupancy rates for all Equity REITs were high at 93.6% and managed growth of 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but witnessed a marginal sequential slip.Admittedly, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains have been fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Further, valuation wise, several REIT stocks seem attractive, while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1, as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry, point at the prevailing favorable environment and re-instill confidence.Thus, the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scopes for growth in a recovering economy. As a bonus point, these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts, reflecting their bullish sentiments.Here are the four picks:  Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale, full-service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities.

112,PLD,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report), along with its operating partnership subsidiary, has entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various investors, for a private placement of 4.39% senior unsecured notes worth $300 million, to be issued by the operating partnership.  The notes, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, are expected to be issued on Jul 17, 2018. The notes will mature on July 17, 2028, and pay semi-annual interests on Jan 17 and Jul 17 each year.All of these notes are guaranteed by Extra Space Storage.The operating partnership intends to utilize the proceeds from this agreement to refinance its existing indebtedness.  The remaining proceeds from the issue will be channelized for general corporate purposes.Per management, this move is a strategic fit to further ladder the company’s debt maturities, reduce secured debt and expand size of unencumbered pool of properties. Further, access to capital from various sources will improve diversity of its balance sheet and maintain an impressive growth trajectory.The company exited first-quarter 2018 with lower liquidity as compared to Dec 31, 2017. In fact, its cash and cash equivalents of roughly $35.5 million was lower than $55.7 million reported at the end of 2017. Also, its percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 74.4%. Hence, these efforts will strengthen its balance sheet.Importantly, the above-mentioned move provides flexibility to the company and helps meet its financial obligations efficiently. This is because the unsecured note issuance offers capital at lower cost to the real estate investment trust (REIT). Furthermore, reduction of secured debt is anticipated to bring down the company’s annualized interest expenses significantly. The move will improve the company’s cash flow and alleviate its bottom-line pressure as well.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year.  In fact, the company’s shares have logged in a gain of 30.8% compared with 1.3% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc.

117,PLD,"Use of leverage for real estate investment trust (REIT) business makes returns from this industry susceptible to interest-rate movements. This is because rise in interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows.However, when fundamentals of the underlying asset category, to which the REITs cater to, remain strong, there is scope for increasing future cash flows from the assets. This is how REITs emerge as winners even with rate hikes.For instance, the industrial asset category has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and healthy manufacturing environment.Particularly, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options, fueling demand for warehouse distribution facilities.Amid this, the industrial investment momentum has gathered steam and superseded the overall commercial real estate market, with investors enhancing the industrial holdings, per a report from real estate services company, JLL Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report). In fact, investment sales aggregated $23.8 billion in the first half of this year. This marked more than 20% increase year over year.Also, industrial rents have touched an all-time high of $5.35 per square foot in the second quarter of 2017 amid the national historic low level of vacancy. While more new supply is coming to the market, there is dearth of quality vacant space in the market to absorb, per the report.Leasing activity for new construction is particularly led by e-commerce, logistics and distribution companies. According to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. This is opening up opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) and Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report).Against such a favorable backdrop, industrial REITs delivered returns of 19.3% through August 2017, handily outpacing the broader market. Considering the improving economy and healthy fundamentals of the industrial sector, this trend is likely to continue.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

118,PLD,"If REIT’s dependence on debt for their business and consideration as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature has made investors skeptical about their performance in a rising rate environment, then time is now apt to think again. This is because some of the asset categories in the real estate market are displaying robust fundamentals, thus offering decent scope to boost future cash flows.One such asset category is the industrial real estate that is witnessing sturdy demand amid an economic recovery, growth of e-commerce and U.S.-based manufacturing. This, in turn, is driving demand for warehouse space, as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate distribution and production platforms.Therefore, this is the right time to add a few industrial REITs to your portfolio. Today, we bring one such stock — Prologis Inc.

These projects included over 7 million square feet of space.Also, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 20.2% year to date, outperforming its industry’s rally of 3.1%.Why a Solid Choice?Revenue Strength: Prologis’ top line has been exhibiting strength for the past several quarters. In fact, since first-quarter 2015 through second-quarter 2017, the company reported better-than-expected revenue figures in each quarter. Given the strength in its fundamentals, this upbeat trend is likely to continue ahead.Cash Flow Growth: Prologis enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 30.8%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 18.0%. Also, the company’s current cash flow growth of 22.5% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 16.0%.FFO per Share Growth: Prologis witnessed 12.6% growth in FFO per share over the last three-five years against 8.0% of that of the industry. In addition, FFO per share is estimated to grow at the rate of 23.6% for 2017.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Prologis is 0.62 compared with the industry average of 0.84. This highlights greater financial stability of the company and lesser risk for shareholders.Superior ROE: Prologis’ Return on Equity (ROE) is 6.65% compared with the industry’s average of 5.97%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.7% upward to $2.81 in two months’ time.

119,PLD,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has been making strategic efforts to strengthen its small shops portfolio. It is relying on omni-channel retailing, in a bid to counter pressure from the rising online sales.Kimco, like other retail real estate investment trusts (REIT), is suffering due to shrinking mall traffic, with online purchases taking precedence. As a result, retailers, unable to counter the mounting competition, are filing for bankruptcies and opting for store closures.

Also, these industries enjoy frequent customer traffic.Kimco has well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster which contribute significantly to its rental revenues. Moreover, these retailers have a strong omni-channel presence that positions the company well to ride on the growth trajectory.Additionally, the company’s 2020 Vision is aligned with the aim to reposition and optimize its portfolio. Adhering to these strategic measures, Kimco is increasing ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States and shedding interest in its joint-venture initiatives.

120,PLD,"So what if the U.S. REIT industry did not have a smooth start this year with returns turning negative in the first two months? The sector not only rebounded in March, but was also in the positive territory in April despite the rate hike and high treasury yields.

(CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, retail REITs are not in the pink as mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through the online channel. In fact, with ecommerce gaining market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Particularly, amid a surge in store closures, Regional Mall REITs bore the brunt in Q1 with temporary increase in vacancies and FFO reporting an 18% decline from the prior quarter. This has also affected the overall REIT industry’s performance as excluding Regional Mall REITs, total REIT FFO would have grown 7.1% from the prior quarter, reflecting solid demand for space from other sectors.Nevertheless, Regional Mall REITs are fighting back and improving the productivity of retail assets by grabbing attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones. So space refilling is taking place at higher rents as is indicated by the strong releasing spreads.In case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and a rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $14.3 billion, denoting a 3.8% sequential increase. Total dividends paid were also up 7.4% from the prior-year quarter. Also, REIT valuations look attractive as with earnings growth along with mixed stock market performance have led to the lowest aggregate price-to-FFO ratio (15.8x) since 2011.So the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scope for growth in a recovering economy. As a bonus point, these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts, reflecting their bullish sentiments.Here are the four picks:  Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale, full-service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities.

121,PLD,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (ARE  -  Free Report) robust fundamentals of the life-science industry have enabled the company’s Class A properties in AAA locations to enjoy high occupancy. Also, the company’s effort to improve credit profile is encouraging. It has an adequate capital buffer, which will likely cushion its position during any adverse situation. However, the company’s global footprint makes its profitability vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Further, near-term dilution effects from the sale of assets remain a concern for the company.Recently, this urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of $1.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59. Results reflected solid internal and external growth. Further, the company experienced an increase in rental rate and net operating income (NOI).Notably, Alexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which, in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company. In fact, as of first-quarter 2018, 57% of the annual rental revenues in effect were derived from investment-grade or large-cap tenants, whereas 79% of the annual rental revenues came in from Class A properties in AAA locations.Further, the company continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. During first-quarter 2018, same-property cash NOI growth was solid at 14.6%. Leasing activity for the quarter was also decent at around 1.5 million rentable square feet (RSF). The company carried out lease renewals and re-leasing of space at rental-rate growth of 19.0%, on a cash basis.In addition, robust external growth, in forms of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations, is likely to boost the company’s operating performance. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, the company placed into service 91,155 RSF at its development project at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge submarket, which is fully leased to four high-quality biotechnology entities, and 27,315 RSF at its redevelopment project at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in Route 128 submarket leased to Visterra, Inc. Further, during the aforementioned period, Alexandria commenced development projects, aggregating 651,951 RSF.Moreover, Alexandria has an adequate financial flexibility to cushion and enhance its market position. The company had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of first-quarter 2018. Also, it has a well-laddered debt-maturity schedule. Importantly, Alexandria improved its credit profile over the past two years.Nonetheless, Alexandria has exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries, which exposes it to risks from currency fluctuations. Further, the company follows the strategy of recycling capital from real estate sales, including non-core operating assets to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. However, the near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Moreover, a rise in interest rates is a challenge for Alexandria as the company has exposure to long-term leased assets. Any rise in rates would increase the cost of financing acquisitions, as well as investment and development activity expenses. Furthermore, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, in the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. During that time frame, shares of Alexandria have depreciated 2.9%, narrower than the 6.4% decline incurred by its industry. Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised marginally upward in a month’s time. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to see a favorable trend in price. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Prologis, Inc.

122,PLD,"Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (MPW  -  Free Report), also known as MPT, announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with One Equity Partners (“OEP”), per which the company will sell its equity stake in Ernest Health, Inc.Further, certain members of Ernest management have agreed to sell interests in Ernest to OEP. Upon closing MPT expects its sale proceeds to be $175 million. This will result in nearly 13% unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) on its original $96-million investment.Notably, MPT will continue to own the real estate interests in 25 post-acute hospitals operated by Ernest. This represents an aggregate investment of around $500 million, including mortgage loans, totaling $115 million, secured by four hospitals.Per the agreement, MPT has provided Ernest an option to prepay the mortgage debt without any penalty. In exchange, MPT has been granted some preferential rights pertaining to future real estate acquisitions. The transaction, which is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including government approvals, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. Furthermore, proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce borrowings under MPT’s revolving credit facility. This is likely to boost the company’s financial flexibility and result in interest cost savings.Per management, One Equity’s focus on Ernest reaffirms the accretive investment made by MPT in 2012. In fact, the significant IRR realized from the investment highlights profitability of the investment. Additionally, this equity investment also enabled the company to create a real estate portfolio of post-acute hospitals that generates impressive returns. Hence, the investment has created significant share value for MPT.     Per Equity One’s management, through this acquisition, it will leverage on Ernest’s positive clinical and patient outcomes to accelerate its growth momentum.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past year.

123,PLD,"Liberty Property Trust’s (LPT  -  Free Report) industrial properties have been experiencing encouraging demand for its properties amid the recovering economy and e-commerce boom.Recently, the company announced securing a long-term lease with Koops, Inc., for 45,600 square feet of space, at the Brookfield South Business Park in Mauldin, SC. The tenant is expected to occupy the space this June.Encouragingly, the deal is significant as it has enabled Liberty Property to achieve 100% occupancy for all four of its buildings in the park spanning 320,400 square feet of space. The Brookfield Business Park is well positioned near I-385 and I-85, southeast of the city of Greenville. The strategic location of the property has enabled the property to enjoy high occupancy levels.In fact, the company’s industrial portfolio, spanning 94.4 million square feet of area, enjoyed solid occupancy of 96.7% at the end of the first quarter. Moreover, industrial rents escalated 12.4% on retained and replacement leases commenced during the quarter.Notably, the company has been making concerted attempts to fortify its national industrial portfolio on the back of strategic acquisitions and developments in key markets.

124,PLD,"Shares of Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) have been performing well, of late. In the past month, the stock has rallied 6.1%, while the industry has gained 3.3%.This rally is anticipated to continue in the near term, as there are a number of favorable factors.In first-quarter 2018, Lamar reported adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 98 cents per share, marking an 11.4% increase from the year-ago tally of 88 cents. Results were driven by growth in revenues. Particularly, net revenues for the reported quarter climbed 4.2% from the prior-year quarter to $361 million.Key Driving FactorsFocus on portfolio expansion: While the company holds significant market share in the U.S. outdoor advertising business, Lamar is continuously expanding its business. For 2018, management expects digital deployment to be more than 200 new digital units. Further, leveraging on the fragmentation of the advertising media segment, the company is expanding its footprint. In first-quarter 2018, the company completed acquisitions for total price consideration of nearly $6.6 million. These strategic moves will enable the company to enjoy solid revenue growth in the upcoming quarters.Superior ROE: Lamar’s return on equity (ROE) is 27.02% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share being revised 1.3% upward to $5.34 in a month’s time. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has moved up, over the past month. This reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Strong cash flow per share: The company generates cash flow per share of $5.43 as compared to the industry’s average of $1.9. This makes us optimistic about Lamar’s operating performance for the long term.Valuable permits serve as trophy assets: Lamar operates in an industry that is characterized by high barriers to entry due to permitting restrictions. This is because the company typically owns permits that allow out-of-home advertising at each location and in fact, the permits are the most prized assets gained from acquisitions. Hence, control on the permits restricts inventory built-up, as well as the intrusion from other market players, both local and national. This provides the company with a solid competitive edge.Zacks RankThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

126,PLD,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, after the market closes.Last quarter, this office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in another and missed in the other, with an average beat of around 4.29%. The graph below depicts this surprise history. SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment.In addition, per a recent study from CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate contracted 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.However, new supply in the Manhattan area could negate the positive effect of decreasing vacancy rates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter property net operating income (NOI) and net rental revenues are currently pegged at $183 million and $281 million, nearly in line with the previous quarter reported figures.  Also, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter edged down 0.6% to $1.57, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being overtly positive on the stock. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SL Green will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SL Green is -1.34%.Zacks Rank: SL Green’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

The increase in occupancy in the U.S. portfolio was 70 bps from the prior-year quarter.During the quarter under review, Prologis signed 47 million square feet of leases in its owned and managed portfolio compared with 49 million square feet in the year-ago period.Prologis' share of net effective rent change was 24.0% in the reported quarter compared with 17.8% recorded a year ago. The figure was led by the U.S., which recorded an impressive 29.0% growth. Cash rent change was 11.2%, as against 7.9% in the year-ago quarter.Net effective same-store net operating income (NOI) registered 4.6% growth compared with 6.1% increase reported in the prior-year period. This was driven by 5.2% growth reported in the U.S. Cash same-store NOI climbed 7.2% compared with 5.3% reported in the year-ago period, reflecting 8.0% growth in the U.S. portfolio.In second-quarter 2017, Prologis' share of building acquisitions amounted to $37 million, development stabilization aggregated $560 million, while development starts totaled $897 million.

Amid a consistent shift toward e-commerce and supply chain strategy transformations, the company is well poised to benefit from its capacity to offer modern distribution facilities in strategic in-fill locations. Despite anticipations of supply increase, it is likely to stand out in the lot given the high demand for its high quality locations.Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

130,PLD,"The Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, might keep investors in the REIT space worried. The Fed’s anticipation that the factors leading to a slowdown in inflation will eventually subside further enhances the chances of a rate hike.However, it won’t be prudent to brood too much on a rate hike. Rather, the focus should be on the expected Q3 financial results of REITs based on the fundamentals of asset categories to which they cater to. Here, we will tell you why:Forget Fed MovesNo doubt, for REITs, which depend on debt for their business and pay high and consistent dividend, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline. But a rise in rates also lugs along scope for increasing future cash flows.In fact, any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy and the central bank’s confidence in the recovery. When economic growth picks up and inflation rises, prices of real estate generally increase. Consequently, rent and occupancy of properties go up. As such, REIT’s earnings, cash flow and dividend get a boost.Focus on Underlying Asset StrengthsIn fact, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Take for example the industrial asset category that has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Also, the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.Pick Stocks Poised to Beat in Q3However, not all REITs from these asset categories are poised to excel. Therefore, in addition to focusing on REITs that have healthy underlying asset category fundamentals, investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can be far more rewarding because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors’ confidence in a stock.Nevertheless, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, which takes into account a favorable rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release third-quarter results:Prologis Inc.

131,PLD,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Extra Space Storage, Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) recently announced a 10.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 86 cents per share, up from 78 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 29, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jun 15.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.44 a share, resulting in a 3.6% yield, considering Extra Space Storage’s closing price of $95.15 on May 25. Since the company’s dividend yield surpasses the industry average of 3.3%, the stock is likely to draw investors’ attention.Moreover, the company remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. In May 2016, the company announced a 32.2% hike in quarterly dividend payout. With that, Extra Space Storage achieved a five-year total increase of 212% in dividend. In fact, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors.Extra Space Storage has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. It is a self-storage REIT that offers a vast array of well-located storage units to its customers, for boat, recreational-vehicle and business purposes. As of Mar 31, 2018, Extra Space Storage enjoyed ownership, had ownership stakes in or managed 1,523 stores in 39 states of the United States, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. Its  ROE is 18.85%, higher than the industry average of 4.9%.Further, the company made concerted efforts to consistently grow its business and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services. Over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. The company gained an increased scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions. It also fortified its presence in a number of new markets.Moreover, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership.

132,PLD,"Industrial REITs have been firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in Q1. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in the quarter to $7.01 per square foot, marking the highest level since 1989.In fact, companies are now compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, in order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, not all industrial REITs are equally poised to excel. Rather, only the ones with solid capacity and healthy fundamentals remain well poised to capitalize on this trend.One such stock is Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 15.4% in a year’s time, against its industry’s decline of 3.6%. There is further scope for solid price appreciation given the REIT’s sound fundamentals and improving prospects.In fact, in April 2018, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors. DCT shareholders will be given 1.02 shares of Prologis in exchange of each DCT share. The transaction, subject to other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in third-quarter 2018.Moreover, backed by solid operating results, Prologis put up a stellar show in first-quarter 2018. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high. This industrial REIT also raised its guidance for 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share.What Makes Prologis a Solid Choice?Revenue Strength: Prologis’ top line has been displaying strength for the past several quarters. In fact, since first-quarter 2015 through first-quarter 2018, the company reported better-than-expected revenue figures in each quarter. Given the strength in its fundamentals, this upbeat trend is likely to continue ahead.Cash Flow Growth: Prologis enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 22.3%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Also, the company’s current cash flow growth of 19.1% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%. Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with more than $3.6 billion of liquidity.FFO per Share Growth: Prologis witnessed 14.9% growth in FFO per share, over the last three-five years, against 6.3% of that of the industry. In addition, its FFO per share is estimated to grow at the rate of 7.1% for the current year, ahead of 3.1% of that of the industry.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Prologis is 0.51 compared with the industry average of 0.84. This highlights greater financial stability of the company and lesser risk for shareholders.Superior ROE: Prologis’ Return on Equity (ROE) is 9.86% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.7% upward to $2.98 in a month’s time. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next year has been revised north, over the past three months. This reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated.

Given Prologis’ solid capacity, it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther similarly-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

137,PLD,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) recently announced signing of lease with 4PX Express USA for ePort 1000, which is the company’s 354,250-square-foot warehouse property at 1000 High Street in Perth Amboy.The leasing of space to the 3PL focused on e-commerce fulfillment and logistics solutions highlights the elevated demand for industrial real estate properties in the market amid the exponential growth in the e-commerce industry. Particularly, this facility is perfectly suited for e-commerce fulfilment in the New York metropolitan area.Notably, ePort 1000 was added to Duke Realty’s portfolio in November 2017 as part of its 3.1 million-square-foot New Jersey industrial portfolio acquisition, which comprised six buildings, as well as two development sites situated along the I-95 corridor. Further, 1000 High Street property is among the three new industrial buildings, which are together referred as the ePort Logistics Center owned by Duke Realty in Perth Amboy.Industrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.Moreover, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This is surely spurring demand for industrial space.In fact, despite supply picking up pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to soar.Specifically, speaking about Duke Realty, we note that the company has resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. The company already has 5.7 million square feet of industrial properties besides having properties in other key markets. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 8.4% in the past three months, outperforming 3.8% growth recorded by its industry.

138,PLD,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Agree Realty Corporation’s (ADC  -  Free Report) board of directors announced a 3.8% hike in the company's quarterly dividend rate to 54 cents from 52 cents paid earlier. The new dividend is scheduled to be paid on Jul 13, to shareholders of record as of Jun 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $2.16 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $2.08 per share. This leads to an annualized yield of 4.33%, considering the retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) closing price of $49.93 on May 15.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Agree Realty remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The cash dividend, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 6.9%, is the 97th consecutive dividend distribution of the company.Agree Realty’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.61 compares favorably with 1.09 for its industry. Also, this retail REIT churns cash flow per share of $3.11 compared with the industry average of $2.14. It witnessed robust cash flow growth in the past. Furthermore, the company’s current cash flow growth is significantly higher than the industry average. Secure cash flow will help the company sustain its dividend payout in the future.However, sub-optimal utilization of equity has resulted in a return on equity of 6.97%, while the industry delivered 6.99%. Also, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry. Agree Realty currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-FFO ratio of 17.4, which compares unfavorably with 13.2 witnessed by the industry. This limits the stock’s upside potential.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry.

140,PLD,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in a $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors.Moreover, the news was well received by Wall Street, as the company’s shares witnessed a marginal rise on May 1, 2018.   Deal Terms:DCT shareholders will be given 1.02 shares of Prologis in exchange of each DCT share. The transaction, subject to DCT stockholders’ approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in third-quarter 2018.  How will Prologis Benefit From The Acquisition?With this acquisition, Prologis adds 71-million-square-foot of operating portfolio that overlaps the company’s existing assets. This enables the company to strengthen its foothold in major high-growth markets of Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York/New Jersey, Seattle and South Florida.Further, this deal has helped the company acquire 7.1 million square feet of development, redevelopment and value-added projects, 195 acres of land in pre-development, with build-out potential of more than 2.9 million square feet, and 215 acres of land under contract or option, with a build-out potential of more than 3.3 million square feet.Considering DCT’s high-quality realigned portfolio, along with an efficient platform and strong customer base, the buyout is expected to solidify Prologis’ market position and improve its growth curve.Notably, the combined portfolio will allow the company to realize significant economies of scale. In fact, management anticipates that the $80-milion synergies in corporate general and administrative cost savings, operating leverage, interest expense, and lease adjustments will increase stabilized core FFO per share by 6-8 cents, annually.Furthermore, the combined portfolios indicate the possibility of generating additional annual revenues and development profit to the tune of $40 million, in the future.Our ViewpointPrologis’ acquisition of one of its peers comes at a time when the industrial real estate market is experiencing a boom, courtesy the e-commerce boom. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in the number of industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations in a bid to improve supply chain efficiencies, and shift near large population centers. These factors have driven demand and rent for industrial realties across the nation.    Hence, amid the encouraging market scenario, this acquisition enables the company to expand its reach in major markets without having to individually purchase assets, that would not be viable given the stiff competition for quality assets.  In addition, we note that the company is well capitalized with a solid balance sheet, and the stock-for-stock deal will increase its U.S. dollar net equity.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry in the past three months.

The graph below depicts this surprise history.SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that SL Green is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and Prologis has the right mix.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62, is +0.62%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: SL Green’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?SL Green is the leading commercial property owner in New York City. The company’s high-quality office properties in proximity to midtown Manhattan’s key commuter stations and diverse tenant base are likely to help the company ride the growth curve. Moreover, its leasing activity is likely to remain decent amid an improving economy and job market environment.In addition, per a recent report from CBRE Group Inc.  in second-quarter 2017, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% amid a balanced demand supply environment. In fact, in around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.Also, SL Green made concerted efforts to diversify and tap opportunities in New York City’s premium retail locations, with its retail investments complementing the core office and structured finance businesses. Along with a solid balance sheet, such efforts are anticipated to drive the company’s top- and bottom-line growth in the quarter to be reported.However, shares of SL Green declined 5.7% over the past three months compared with the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust – Other industry’s descend of 1.8%. Nevertheless, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter inched up 0.6% to $1.62, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Prologis Inc.

146,PLD,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 8.1%. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 4.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 71 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market is firing on all cylinders, backed by an improving economy and job-market gains, strengthening e-commerce market and high consumption levels. Demand for warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong, and continues to surpass supply levels.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 32 straight quarters to 7.2% for the U.S. industrial real estate market in the April-June quarter. Notably, this denotes the lowest level since 2000.Given Prologis’s capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. It also has solid balance-sheet strength. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to have enjoyed high occupancy of its properties and healthy rent levels.Moreover, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity has been stellar in the year so far, with the company completing 16 such development projects in the first half. These projects included more than 6.2 million square feet of area and involved total expected investment (TEI) of around $475 million on a Prologis-share basis. Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) commenced 14 build-to-suit development starts during the same period, comprising more than 4.7 million square feet of space and involving a TEI of approximately $450 million on a Prologis-share basis.This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s land bank, as well as demand from its multi-site customers, many of whom are focused on e-commerce. These sites are positioned in urban markets that are suited for serving as the last warehouse before goods are delivered to consumers.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $560 million, indicating 0.7% increase sequentially.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter being revised 1.4% upward to 71 cents over the past three months. However, the figure denotes a projected year-over-year decrease of around 15.5%.Year to date, Prologis has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have appreciated 1.8% in this period compared with its industry’s growth of 0.5%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +2.26%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

147,PLD,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across markets with potential. Furthermore, the company’s strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for its long-term growth. Moreover, Host Hotels is anticipated to improve the revenues per available room backed by its value-enhancement initiatives.Nonetheless, elevated supply in the company’s key markets is expected to reduce its pricing power. Further, geographical concentration of assets in upscale markets exposes it to the economic doldrums prevailing in the region.Earlier this month, the company reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 43 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity.Also, Host Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70.Notably, Host Hotels undertakes a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position over vibrant global markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.During first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion. Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company’s capital expenditures were around $115 million — $29 million was allocated to return on investment (ROI) capital projects and $86 million for the renewal and replacement projects.The company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for 2018. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects and $290-$330 million in the renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are likely to help the company improve its portfolio quality and bolster revenues.Further, Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020. This provides it ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities while carrying out redevelopment initiatives.Though supply growth has been tepid in the past, it has gathered momentum in recent times. In fact, supply growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018 as well as 2019, particularly in markets where the company has exposure.As the majority of Host Hotels’ properties are concentrated in the luxury and upper-upscale segments, during any economic downturn, these segments bear the brunt as unfavorable macroeconomic conditions compel customers to reduce discretionary spending and choose lower-priced brands over the company’s premium ones. Also, the hotel industry is cyclical in nature and heavily dependent on the overall health of economies in which it operates.Though an economic slowdown has an immediate impact on the company’s revenues, many of the expense categories associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, remain relatively inflexible.In the past three months, shares of Host Hotels have outperformed the industry it belongs to. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have ascended 18.4% while the industry recorded growth of 7.8% during this time frame.Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 3.6% upward in a month’s time. Given the progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the upcoming period.Other Stocks Worth a LookSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc.

148,PLD,"Highwood Properties, Inc.’s (HIW  -  Free Report) efforts to improve portfolio quality by focusing on assets in best business districts (BBD) bode well. However, assets concentrated in a few markets make it vulnerable to the economic and political doldrums prevalent in the area.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Results reflected a year-over-year improvement in same-property cash net operating income (NOI).The company also raised its full-year funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook, revising it from the previous range of $3.35-$3.47 to $3.37-$3.47. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Highwoods is within this range.Further, the company’s assets are located in markets witnessing improvement in economy and job growth rates. Per management, with an accretive job and economic environment in the Southeastern markets, Highwood’s markets have met or surpassed the national average for annual employment growth rate for 27 consecutive quarters. Against this backdrop, demand and rent for Highwoods premium office spaces is expected to grow.Further, to benefit from the recovering market, this real estate investment trust (REIT) has been expanding its footprint in high growth markets through asset acquisitions, dispositions and developments. To fund these acquisitions, the company is utilizing sale proceeds from non-core asset dispositions. In fact, on Feb 6, the company purchased two land parcels in CBD Nashville by using 1031 exchange funds accrued from dispositions in 2017. Such strategic moves will improve its portfolio quality without affecting the company’s balance sheet.However, with dearth of trophy assets available for purchase, the acquisition market remains unfavorable. This has resulted in steep pricing of high-quality assets and intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, as well as other commercial real estateFurthermore, the company has a large development pipeline, with anticipated total investments of $440 million. This extensive development plan increases operational risks by exposing the company to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks.The stock has gained 5.8% year to date, outperforming 3.2% growth registered by the industry it belongs to. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc.

152,PLD,"Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) 21-building campus in Menlo Park, CA, has been acquired by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) for $400 million as part of the latter's expansion plans, per Bloomberg. The warehouses will be demolished, where office and residential spaces will be built to accommodate Facebook's employees.This industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) purchased the property in Menlo Park, 10 years ago, for $110 million. Per the chief executive officer of Prologis, Hamid Moghadam, Facebook had to double its previous offer, made in 2015, to acquire the space.The deal reflects how warehouses are benefiting from solid demand for space in urban areas. Another advantage being enjoyed by the industrial REITs is better pricing power due to declining warehouse supply.Amid e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations for improving supply chain efficiencies and shifting closer to large population centers, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has been increasing. This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow and given Prologis’ solid capacity, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Particularly, with a large customer base, e-commerce boom and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategies toward same-day delivery and other services, which are propelling demand for modern distribution facilities.Further, healthy manufacturing environment, recovering economy and job-market gains are likely to drive demand from other sectors beside e-commerce.

153,PLD,"AvalonBay Communities (AVB  -  Free Report), along with Terra, which is a development firm based in Florida, has purchased portions of a redevelopment project in Doral for $33.5 million, as a report by the Bizjournal.Presently, the property has offices spanning 136,892 square feet and a 4,322-square-feet restaurant. Both of these will be knocked down to build a mixed-use project named Atrium.The company plans to construct 350 apartments in an eight-storied building. An affiliate of AvalonBay, Avalon Doral LLC has purchased the land, spanning 4.57 acres, for $20 million. Stantic is the architect for this project.Moreover, the other 5.23 acres were bought by an affiliate of Terra called Doral Atrium Retail Investments for $13.5 million and they plan to construct retail space covering 90,000 square feet. This space will be developed by Beame Architectural Partnership.Notably, AvalonBay has high-quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable it to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, in 2017, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core FFO per share growth. Going forward, based on the company’s strong fundamentals, we expect the uptrend to continue.Further, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise solid prospects for AvalonBay. Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered. Also, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent.In fact, a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life-cycle events are getting delayed. This is leading to an extension of the average age of first-time homeownership. This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of the net job growth and is helping to increase primary renter demand. Household formation is picking up pace as well.Nonetheless, the company faces stiff competition from other housing alternatives such as rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes. Such a competitive landscape limits AvalonBay’s ability to increase rent, thereby restricting its growth momentum.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

154,PLD,"As part of its efforts to focus on out-of-home (OOH) advertising business, Outfront Media (OUT  -  Free Report) has collaborated with Greenridge Farm. The primary motive behind this campaign is to ensure that people check the ingredients and compare rationally between the meats offered by different brands. They also intend to make consumers aware of the natural products offered by Greenridge Farm.The company plans to initiate the campaign with 27 billboards developed by Outfront Studios across Chicago. Billboards, strategically located on expressways as well as bridge trestles, will highlight catchy taglines such as ""Our fine print is not 'fine print'"" to grab the attention of meat consumers, and promote Greenridge Farm’s natural, premium-quality meats and sausages.Through the best-in-class technology and assets in premium high traffic outdoor spaces, Outfront Media will likely help in reaching the target audience and drive the campaign.Also, Outfront Media’s mobile network will be used in the campaign to reach buyers. Additionally, the agency’s mobile network is expected to keep its target audience engaged. Moreover, shoppers can be reached at the stores selling Greenridge Farm deli meats and sausages through geofencing technology.Jodi Senese, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Outfront Media informed, ""The collaboration between our teams was extraordinary, and our ability to develop the creative and include both our billboards and mobile network will truly show Chicago who Greenridge Farm is.""Of late, Outfront Media has been focusing on the expansion of its OOH advertising business. In April 2018, the company announced collaboration with Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) for an OOH advertisement campaign, which is going to run through July and display Mustang’s 2018 model.Earlier, in March 2018, Outfront Media announced a partnership with The Body Shop for their first-ever OOH advertisement campaign 'Forever Against Animal Testing.’ Also, the company announced a collaboration with the University of Michigan Counseling and Psychological Services, the Steven Schwartzberg Foundation, LOGIC, Glenn Close, and Michi and Brandon Marshall, for a campaign to raise awareness about mental health.However, Outfront Media faces stiff competition from other outdoor advertisers, regarding customers, display locations and structures. It also competes with other media, including conventional platforms, along with online, mobile & social media platforms. This is anticipated to adversely affect the company’s pricing power in the market.Amid soft market concerns, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry in the past six months.

156,PLD,"If the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have made investors skeptical about their investment in the REIT industry, then perhaps this is the right time to reconsider.This is because total returns from REITs not only rebounded in March, but also outshined the S&P 500’s gain. Particularly, according to REIT.com, the broadest index of the U.S. REIT industry — the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index — locked in a gain of 3.74% in the month, while the S&P 500 incurred a loss of 2.54%.While REITs’ dependence on debt for business and the fact that these are considered bond substitutes, for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, made investors skeptical, it seems that they are now thinking otherwise. Rather, they are emphasizing individual market dynamics which end up playing a crucial role in the performance of REITs.For example, take the industrial REITs which registered 4.59% growth in March. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE.Admittedly, this asset class is witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms.Particularly, with a larger customer base, e-commerce boom and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other such options, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid rise in asset values.And why not! According to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This is surely spurring demand for industrial space.In fact, despite supply picking up pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Further, a healthy manufacturing environment, a recovering economy and job market gains are likely to drive demand from other sectors besides e-commerce. So, shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Currently, Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have a projected growth rate of 4.6%, 4.4% and 6%, respectively.

Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained at a record high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 2.71%. This is depicted in the graph below: Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 74 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market is firing on all cylinders, backed by a recovering economy and job-market improvements, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Given Prologis’s capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. The company also has solid balance-sheet strength.Prologis enjoys high number of build-to-suit development projects, which reflects the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank, as well as the sturdy network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. Amid elevated demand, the company is expected to enjoy high occupancy level of its properties.As such, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter being revised 7.2% upward to 74 cents over the past three months. The figure denotes a projected year-over-year increase of 17.5%.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $551 million, indicating flat projection sequentially.In the past three months, Prologis has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have dipped 0.3%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.5% during this time frame.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +0.79%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

158,PLD,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) recently announced developing a 277,222-square-foot build-to-suit facility in Maple Grove for Minneapolis-based ILLUME. The building will serve as new headquarters for the candle manufacturer.The construction of the facility, which will have office/manufacturing/warehouse spaces, is scheduled to commence in second-quarter 2018 and significant completion is expected in first-quarter 2019.Specifically, the building is being built on 12.65 acres of land and will have more than 20,000 square feet of Class A office space on two levels. In addition, there will be more than 75,000 square feet of light manufacturing, 36′ clear height, and parking for accommodation of up to 275 cars.The facility with modern features will be positioned within Duke Realty’s master-planned project — Arbor Lakes Business Park — situated adjacent to Arbor Lakes Retail. Further, with amenities, such as more than 140 retailers, 65 restaurants and five hotels in its vicinity, the property will likely help ILLUME lure more employees and drive growth.Notably, Duke Realty had resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. The latest move is in sync with its expansion efforts and the company already enjoys ownership of approximately five million square feet of industrial space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.In addition, recently, the company completed the acquisition of a 3.1-million-square-foot industrial property in New Jersey. The move has helped the company expand its New Jersey industrial portfolio to 5.6 million square feet.As a matter of fact, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention, of late, due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is opening up growth opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Duke Realty is well positioned to benefit from escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The company enjoys ownership and operations of industrial properties spread across nearly 146 million rentable square feet of space. These properties are located across 21 key logistics markets. However, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term. Further, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns.Duke Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past month, the stock inched up 0.2% against the 2.9% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.

159,PLD,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index.

160,PLD,"With the Q2 earnings season on its last leg, this is the right time to gauge the performance of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry.Admittedly, rate hikes and a cautious approach of investors have affected gains in this industry so far this year. However, investors need to keep in mind that operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories. A number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates remained high in the second quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth.Specifically, the Q2 scorecard reveals that the total FFO of the listed U.S Equity REIT industry of $15.6 billion in the reported quarter increased 7.9% sequentially. The figure also came in 7.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Same-store net operating income (NOI) reported 3.3% year-over-year growth. Results were driven by segments like Single Family Homes, Data Centers and Manufactured Home Communities, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 6.8%, 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively.Furthermore, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate remained unchanged at 93.4%, slightly below the record high occupancy rate of 93.7% recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.Admittedly, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery, ecommerce gaining strength, and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Also, the residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number in check. No doubt, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and were able to replace with the ones which departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) and industrial REIT Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 3.4% and 7.7%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and residential REIT Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering positive surprise of 1.2% and around 1.7%, respectively.Currently, Digital Realty, Prologis, Simon Property Group and Essex Property carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

163,PLD,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) has been experiencing solid demand for industrial space from its existing tenants. The company recently announced that it would develop a 220,000 square foot industrial building for global conveyance solutions leader – Intralox, LLC – at 7157 Ridge Road, in Hanover, MD. This move would enable Intralox to expand its business and consolidate three locations.Known as Liberty Ridge, this new build-to-suit project is located at an advantageous location in the BWI Corridor close to the Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport. The location provides immediate access to major transport routes including I-95, I-295 and Route 100.For this new Class A building in Hanover, ground breaking has already taken place and its completion is slated in spring 2018. It would complement Liberty's present 4 million square foot industrial portfolio in the region beside I-95 spanning from Harford County to Prince George's County.Notably, Liberty has been making concerted efforts to expand its industrial portfolio amid the improving fundamentals in this real estate category. Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc.  – the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate contracting 10 basis points to 7.8%.This not only marked the market’s 27th decline over the past 28 quarters, but also the lowest level since first-quarter 2001. Obviously, the recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement, but specifically, e-commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers. Also, lesser-than-expected completions of construction kept a check on the supply numbers. Such healthy fundamentals are creating scope for industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report), STAG Industrial, Inc. (STAG  -  Free Report) and Liberty to flourish.  In fact, Liberty’s industrial portfolio, spanning 92.3 million square feet, was 95.9% leased at the end of the second quarter. Industrial distribution rents escalated 11.9% on renewal and replacement leases signed during the quarter. Additionally, same-store operating income for the industrial portfolio climbed 2.1% on a cash basis and 2.7% on a straight-line basis.Currently Liberty currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Also, its shares have outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date.In fact, the company’s shares logged in a gain of 6.4% against the 3.0% return booked by the industry. It witnessed an impressive performance in second-quarter 2017, with both funds from operations (“FFO”) per share and revenues surpassing estimates. Given its progress on fundamentals and a decent Zacks Rank, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.                                                                           See these buy recommendations now >>

The building has been leased to a personal storage company, PODS.The new building will have 32-foot-high ceilings, 59 trailer parking spaces as well as 239 parking spaces.

This move led to the formation of an independent public company – JBG Smith (JBGS) — which started trading on the NYSE on Jul 18.The combined entity has become the largest landlord to the U.S. government in the capital. While Vornado’s shareholders have 73% stake in the new company and JBG investors and management own 21% and 6% stake, respectively.According to Vornado’s announcement of the spin-off, JBG's senior management team would oversee the management of the newly formed business.

These assets are located in the premier submarkets of the Washington, DC metropolitan area.The combined entity is anticipated to create synergies worth approximately $35 million. The company would be well funded, with strong liquidity and balance-sheet positions.After being criticized for venturing into too many sectors, Vornado spun off its shopping center business in 2015 into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties.

Given Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) capacity, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities.In fact, the company provides industrial distribution warehouse space in some of the busiest distribution markets across the globe. Its properties are typically located in large, supply-constrained infill markets with airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities nearby, which facilitates rapid distribution of customers’ products.At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, occupancy level in the company’s owned and managed portfolio was 97.2%, expanding 10 basis points (bps) year over year. This record level was driven by the U.S. portfolio which experienced 98.0% of occupancy. Moreover, the company’s share of net effective rent change was 19.0% in the quarter compared with 16.0% recorded in the prior year. The figure was led by the U.S. portfolio, which recorded impressive growth of 29.8%.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. For full-year 2017, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7%, on a market capitalization basis, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x to 4.6x. The company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities backed by its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management.In addition, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Prologis remains committed to that. Shareholders of the company rejoiced this February after the board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. This dividend rate is expected to be sustainable on the back of the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio and payout ratio compared to that of the industry.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry in the last year. The stock has gained 17% against the industry’s descend of 5.3% during this time frame.However, recovery in the industrial market has persisted for a long time and chances of any significant drop in availability rates are less. In fact, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth.Additionally, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for the company. Rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which might affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

The move has helped the company expand its New Jersey industrial portfolio to 5.6 million square feet.The latest acquired portfolio includes six newly built warehouses and two land sites for future development. Located along the I-95 corridor, the acquired portfolio enjoys proximity to New York City and boasts features suitable for improved product storage and distribution like 36′ clear heights and sufficient automobile and trailer parking.While the buildings in the acquired portfolio were delivered within the past year, Duke Realty has already started developing a 661,000-square-foot warehouse on one of the acquired sites, 429 Delancy Street in Newark.

These properties are located across 21 key logistics markets. Nevertheless, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term.

Recently, the company added approximately 900,000 square feet of space in its Southern California portfolio by securing a pair of two industrial properties in the Inland Empire East submarket.   The latest projects have enabled the pure play real estate investment trust (REIT) to enhance an industrial portfolio exceeding 10 million square feet of space in Southern California. Notably, the company has expanded its portfolio through disciplined acquisitions and development since it entered the market in 2011, resulting in an impressive asset base of more than 30 well-situated premium bulk distribution properties.  Specifically, Duke Realty is developing a bulk industrial building spanning 241,216 square feet of area at 24960 San Michele in the Moreno Valley and another 656,695-square-foot warehouse at 4323 Indian Avenue in Perris.While both industrial facilities are currently under construction, the property at 24960 San Michele was fully pre-leased by ResMed — a manufacturer of CPAP masks and products related to sleep-disordered breathing.The spec building at 4323 Indian Avenue is scheduled to complete in December 2018.

177,PLD,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is rumored to be selling the company’s 22 Brookdale-managed senior housing properties for $428 million to New York firm — Apollo Global Management LLC (APO  -  Free Report) — per a Bloomberg news. Earlier this June, the company announced that it has entered into definitive deals for selling those 22 properties, having 2,781 units, to an institutional investor.This healthcare REIT has been selling several of its senior housing assets in a bid to improve the quality of the company’s senior housing portfolio, strengthen balance sheet and lower the Brookdale Senior Living Inc. operator concentration.  Particularly, HCP has reaped $332 million of proceeds through completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture (JV) to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors, LLC. Notably, this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of those were managed by Brookdale. Moreover, HCP completed the sale of six assets to Brookdale for $275 million. This was done through disposition of one asset in January and five in April. Last year, HCP also accomplished the sale of a portfolio of 64 triple-net assets leased to Brookdale to affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P., for $1.125 billion.Further, this March, the company announced the transition of management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living, Inc., and has already transitioned 18 of those.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve and the revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.On the other hand, HCP is focused on making opportunistic acquisitions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. The company acquired Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market in December 2017 and is experiencing strong leasing velocity. Moreover, in March 2018, the company acquired development rights at Hayden for $21 million and its planned 214,000-square-foot Class A development is expected to improve the company’s scale in this leading life-science market.Also, the company started the Phase I of Sierra Point, which marks its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market. In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, has promoted life science and medical-market fundamentals, and this trend will likely continue in the upcoming years, giving significant impetus for growth to HCP.Over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

178,PLD,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is making concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market. Recently, the company announced that it started developing an 183,296-square-foot bulk warehouse at Glendale Heights in the Central DuPage submarket. The new building, situated at 990 North Avenue (Route 64) and close to I-355, is expected to be delivered in November 2018.Having decent freeway access, the construction of this building on a speculative basis seems a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Central DuPage submarket enjoys proximity to downtown Chicago and has densely inhabited neighborhoods in its surroundings.Moreover, the area is a preferred choice for companies, seeking last-mile distribution locations. Also, with limited availability, the submarket enjoys solid leasing activity. Duke Realty already has a presence in the submarket, with five other buildings, aggregating more than 1.3 million square feet. All the buildings are fully leased.Notably, industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) are indeed firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability declined for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.In fact, despite supply picking up the pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.With recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated in the future. Moreover, with healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high.    Specifically, speaking about Duke Realty, we note that the company has resorted to the sale of suburban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.9% in the past three months, outperforming 4.7% growth recorded by its industry.

This lease has enabled the company to achieve full occupancy.Notably, the 12-year deal follows Mack-Cali's comprehensive capital-investment program at the property, aimed to upgrade amenities at the property. In fact, the property’s common spaces were refurbished with new entryway and lobby, full-service café, fitness center, conference room, and exterior landscaping. Further, technological features like electric vehicle-charging stations were integrated. Hence, the overhaul plan has likely driven occupancy at the property.In addition, the eight-story Class A building is strategically located in one of the busiest business corridors in the area and is just 20 minutes away from the Newark Liberty International Airport. In fact, 581 Main Street provides easy access to the New Jersey Turnpike. Also, it is well connected to the Metropark and Woodbridge rail stations, as well as the NJ Transit bus service. Convenient transit access has likely favored demand for the property.Per management, Plymouth Rock’s lease in Woodbridge “positions the company for continued growth”.

Another community has been transitioned to existing operating partner — Sonata Senior Living. For the rest 21 Brookdale-managed communities, the company is settling deals to transition to other operators and opting for sale of select assets.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve as the company is targeting to lower Brookdale exposure to 16% of overall portfolio income from 34% in fourth-quarter 2016.  The revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.In fact, over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%. The focus on having a diversified private pay portfolio is likely to drive long-term growth.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
