0,ANTM,"On Jul 5, Centene Corp.’s (CNC  -  Free Report) shares hit a 52 week high of $128.02, ending the day a tad lower at $128.00.Recent positive developments, which includes the completion of Fidelis Care acquisition, securing New Hampshire Department of Corrections contract and other buyouts, seems to have spurred the stock.In a year’s time, the stock has gained a significant 57.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%. In fact, its performance looks more illustrious when compared with others in the space such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), which have registered gains of 33.3%, 28.5% and 25.3%, respectively.What’s Behind the Rally?The Fidelis Care buyout is a catalyst for Centene as the acquisition would poise the company well in the country’s four largest states. It will also aid expansion in Medicare Advantage and Exchanges.Recent Medicaid contracts in five states of Arizona, New Mexico, Iowa, Florida and Washington will bolster the company’s revenues.The recent acquisition of MHM Services positions the company well in the rapidly growing business managing benefits for correctional facilities. The company’s correctional health plans business has grown over the past year and the deal will expand its correctional presence to six states.Also last month the company’s subsidiary Centurion of New Hampshire was re-approved a contract for continuing the provision of medical and dental professionals to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.In March, Centene completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), which highlights its targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. In addition to CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services is likely to enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to utilize RX Advance’s cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost.The company also acquired an additional 61% investment in Interpreta in March. It is an innovative health IT company focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics. These deals will help the company in developing its PB business, consequently aiding in savings by significantly reducing both administrative and drug impacted medical costs.Will the Momentum Stay?The company’s re-procurement wins, expansion into new markets, and future growth pipeline will drive its long-term growth. Moreover, the diversification into other businesses such as advisory services, data analytics, forging government partnerships in new markets   positions the company  for strong growth ahead.There seems to be no hindrance in the stock’s growth trajectory at the moment. Moreover, the stock looks attractively valued with a PEG ratio of 1.1 comparing favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.4.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1,ANTM,"Changing U.S. demography with baby boomers entering retirement age in hordes has pushed up demand for products such as Medicaid and Medicare. This has led to strong membership growth with states turning to private players to manage these plans.Also, development of ancillary business in recent years to diversify revenue sources, in the wake of tough regulations laid on the health insurance business, has opened up new avenues of growth. These businesses, mostly in the form of health care services, are growing rapidly and forming a large part of the industry’s total revenues.Companies attach great importance to health services business, which enables them to play a role of a comprehensive health care provider and thus have made huge investments for expansion. Therefore growth in this business should continue, thus providing resilience to the industry’s top line.Despite revenue growth, medical cost increases and laws relating to minimum medical loss ratios have put pressure on the bottom line. Moreover, a shift in business mix in recent years from Commercial full risk to the less-profitable administrative services only, has partially offset the otherwise strong revenue growth.Nonetheless, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, application of blockchain technology, mergers and acquisitions, and healthy balance sheets should help health insurers stand tall going forward.Outstanding Industry ReturnsImposition of tough regulations from the Affordable Care Act and the subsequent regulatory uncertainty brought in by the Trump’s administration did not deter the industry’s growth. In fact, the health insurance industry has put up a good show and gained from an increase in insured rates, which have directly led to an increase in revenues, membership and earnings of the players in the industry. Strong capital levels across the industry have enable disciplined capital management via share buyback and dividend payments, which have further drawn investor attention.The Zacks Medial-Health Maintenance Organization industry, which is a stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.We see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 29.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite have rallied 12.8% and Zacks Medical Sector have declined 2.1%.One-Year Price Performance Health Insurance Stocks Look AttractiveThe industry’s outperformance over the last year explains to some extent its high steep valuation. We look at the industry’s price-to-earnings ratio (PE) ratio, the most appropriate ratio for valuing a health insurer as its earnings stability.The PE ratio essentially measures the company’s share price relative to its earnings. It tells how much an investor should pay for per unit of the company’s earnings.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 17.6, which is at its median level over the preceding year. In the past year, the industry has traded in a range of 15.9 to 20.1.The space looks a bit stretched when compared with the market at large as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 16.7.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M)However, going a step further and considering the industry’s growth rate, which is reflected by its PEG ratio, we find the industry attractively valued. Its forward 12-month PEG ratio of 1.3 compares favorably with that of 1.7 for the S&P 500. This indicated the industry’s superior growth potential and an attractive valuation.PEG Ratio (F12M)Outperformance May Continue Despite Soft Earnings OutlookIncreasing demand for retirement products from the aging U.S. population should lead to an increase in Medicaid and Medicare products, which should aid the top line. Moreover, increasing employment will also drive employers’ demand for insurance for their employees. The formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) — a group of health care providers aimed at providing efficient care at lower cost — should help to keep a check on medical care cost, thus aiding margins.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from the current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revision trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations from it and the aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price  and Consensus: Medical HMO Industry This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $10.98 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company within the Zacks Life Insurance industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate RevisionWhile the consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Foreign Banks industry of $10.98 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement (up 15.2%), the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 0.8% downward since May 31, 2018.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates ImprovementThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks.The Zacks Life Insurance Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, placing it at the top 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Health Insurers Promise Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry are bright. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Health Insurance industry appears promising.Though the group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has moderated a tad since January 2018, when it was 13.29%, to reach the current level of 13.13%, the same compares favorably with 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateIn fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be a steady top line that the Zacks Health Insurance industry has sustained since 2010. Bottom LineContinuing consolidation in the industry should transform health insurers into comprehensive health care providers, which will enable the companies to offer superior care at lower cost thus aiding margins.Recently the Department of Labor released the final rule on Association Health Plans for small businesses across the United States, which is expected to benefit approximately 11 million citizens of America, working for such firms. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans.Also, development of products and services, which include care delivery, population health management and engagement, health financial services, health IT, benefit operations, care operations and pharmacy care services, which complement their core business lines — Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products — and enable enhanced service delivery and experience to their customers and will accrue to revenues and earnings.In recent years, health insurers have been moving to international markets. This shift is expected to continue given that the international markets remain underpenetrated. This should provide immense scope for growth.Therefore keeping the long-term projections in mind, investors could take advantage of the attractive valuation and bet on a few health insurance stocks with a strong earnings outlook.Below are four stocks with positive earnings estimate revisions and a bullish Zacks Rank.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

2,ANTM,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:Anthem Inc.

3,ANTM,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) recently announced that one of its units has signed a definitive agreement to sell 291-bed AllianceHealth Deaconess hospital in Oklahoma City, OK along with other related businesses to a subsidiary of INTEGRIS Health. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Post the sale, the leading operator of general acute care hospitals would be able to continue its operation across the seven hospitals in Oklahoma. The hospital to be put on sale is among the additional planned divestitures, discussed on the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings call.Earlier this year, the company’s subsidiaries also completed their sale of 60-bed Byrd Regional Hospital and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of Allegiance Health Management;  85-bed Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown in Jamestown, TN and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of Rennova Health, Inc.; three Tennessee hospitals including 225-bed Tennova - Dyersburg Regional in Dyersburg, 150-bed Tennova-Regional Jackson in Jackson and 100-bed Tennova Volunteer Martin in Martin alongside their associated assets to West Tennessee Healthcare.

It is selling its non-core assets and currently focusing on its core business. Notably, Community Health sold as many as 30 hospitals last year.The company’s divestitures are allowing it to focus on the most sustainable markets for better growth.

It expects that the hospital divestitures would be able to generate $1.3 billion of gross proceeds in 2018.

4,ANTM,"Estimates for Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.60% and 0.59%, respectively.Anthem is poised to gain from a thriving health insurance industry. A strong U.S. economy has enabled the health insurance industry to stand in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and a gradual wage increase bode well for this space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by insurers. Anthem flaunts an impressive Value Style Score of A.

It expects its adjusted net income per share to be more than $15.30, a 27% increase from the level in 2017 and up from the prior projection of more than $15.

Operating revenues are anticipated in the $91-$92 billion band, higher than the earlier forecast of $90.5-$91.5 billion. Consolidated medical loss ratio is assumed to be 84.4% plus or minus 30 basis points, a 10-basis point improvement at the midpoint from the previous outlook.Increasing Membership: The company has successfully grown its membership base, backed by solid acquisition strategies, rollouts of health insurance exchanges and national accounts in the commercial segment as well as Medicaid expansion in the government segment. Although in the first quarter of 2018, the medical enrollment dropped by new account wins in national and local group businesses. The company hopes to increase its membership base during the remaining months of 2018, banking on more investments.Growing Net Investment Income: Due to low interest rates, the company has been suffering at length. But the metric grew 15% in 2016, 11.2% in 2017 and 10.6% during the first quarter of 2018 on a year-over-year basis.

Best recently upgraded UnitedHealth Group Incorporated’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Long-term Issuer Credit Ratings from “a” to “a+” and has also affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) for most UnitedHealthcare insurance subsidiaries. The outlook remains stable.Additionally, the credit rating body has upgraded the Long-Term ICR of the company to “a-” from “bbb+” along with the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) to “a-” from “bbb+” for the existing senior unsecured notes and its Short-Term Issue Credit Rating (Short-Term IR) to AMB-1 from AMB-2. The outlook for the Credit Ratings is stable.The credit rating giant has also assigned a Long-Term IRs of “a-” for the company’s recently marketed senior unsecured notes.A.M. Best has also upgraded the FSR for Dental Benefit Providers of California, Inc. (San Francisco, CA), Nevada Pacific Dental (Las Vegas, NV) and National Pacific Dental, Inc. (Richardson, TX) from A- (Excellent) to A (Excellent) and the Long-term ICR from “a-“to “a”. The outlook of these ratings remains stable.Ratings RepresentationThe rating agency acknowledges UnitedHealth’s balance sheet strength, its solid operating performance, extremely favorable business profile and strong enterprise risk management.The rating upgrades represent the strengthening of risk-adjusted capitalization, steady strong premium growth, favorable earnings along with low volatility. The company’s significant nationwide presence, large and growing enrollment base, diversified premium revenues, business strategy and developed risk management program play an instrumental role behind its sturdy balance sheet and operating trends.The solid risk-adjusted capitalization is supported by consistent profitability, conservative high credit quality asset collection, etc. However, it was partially offset by dividends to the parent entity. A significant level of liquidity at the company’s insurance operations is led by growing operating cash flows that are again supplemented by credit facilities with the parent company.The operating performance of the company has been commendable along with top-line growth, rate hikes and organic growth. The credit rating agency expects the company’s operating margins to stay stable with the bottom line boosted by increased premium revenues.A.M. Best also expects the company’s membership o continue growing but at a moderate pace, driven mostly by Medicare and Medicaid. UnitedHealth’s long-term partnership with AARP is the main driver of its strong growth in the senior market.Business diversification that the company derives from its service segment named Optum is positively seen by the rating agencies. This segment, which provides services to the insurance operations of its main segment UnitedHealthcare, generates significant earnings and cash flow to the parent company, which are non-regulated and do not require approval for dividend payments.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have surged 37.58% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 31.39%. Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical industry might consider a few better-ranked stocks such as WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

6,ANTM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple-S Management (GTS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move, with the stock up 14.7% over the past month. GTS hit a new 52-week-high of $41.92 in the previous session. Triple-S Management has gained 67.9% since the start of the year compared to the 2.3% move for the Medical sector and the 13.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Triple-S Management reported EPS of $0.60 vs. the Zacks Consensus of $0.24, while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.93%.For the current fiscal year, Triple-S Management is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share on $3.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 0.53% change in EPS on a 4.89% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.20 per share on $3.17 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.79% and 4.27%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTriple-S Management may be at a 52-week-high right now, but what might the future hold for GTS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Triple-S Management has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.5X versus its peer group's average of 15.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.2. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Triple-S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Triple-S Management fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though GTS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Triple-S Management Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Triple-S Management have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including WellCare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is in the top 24% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

7,ANTM,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service recently downgraded the ratings of Community Health Systems (CYH  -  Free Report). The ratings include Corporate Family Rating (CFR), which were lowered to Caa2 from Caa1 and the Probability of Default Rating (PDR), which deteriorated to Caa2-PD/LD from Caa1-PD. The ratings outlook remains stable.The above was based on the company’s announcement of the final results of its debt exchange wherein holders exchanged part of unsecured notes due 2019, 2020 and 2022 for new junior lien notes due 2023 and 2024. The credit rating agency considered this transaction a distressed exchange, in other words, a default according to them. Moreover, Moody’s appended the PDR with an ""/LD"", indicating a limited default. However, it will be removed after three business days.The transaction largely addresses the company’s 2019 and 2020 notes maturities. The agency expects that Community Health will seek to amend or extend the maturity of its Term Loan G in the upcoming weeks. If the Term Loan G is successful, then the next significant debt maturity will be due Jan, 2021.Although the progress in extending maturities exists, the downgrade of the CFR and PDR ratings indicates the agency’s prediction of weakening interest coverage, cash flow and liquidity. It forecasts that the negative free cash flow over the next 12 to 18 months and interest coverage (EBITDA-capex/interest) to stay below 1.0x. A Caa3 rating was also assigned to the new secured junior lien notes due 2023 and 2024 by Moody’s. Additionally, the ratings on the remaining unsecured notes due 2019, 2020 and 2022 from Caa2, reflects the subordination to the new junior lien debt.The credit rating body has also downgraded the rating on the first lien secured debt from B2 to B3. The Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was affirmed as SGL-3.Ratings RationaleCaa2 Corporate Family Rating indicates the agency’s expectation that the company will continue its operation with high financial leverage over 8.0x. The rating agency also anticipates negative free cash flow over the next 12 to 18 months because of the company’s significant capital requirements and high interest costs.Another concerning factor is the industry-wide operating headwinds which would limit operational improvement despite Community Health’s turnaround initiatives. The ratings have been supported by the company’s large scale, demographic diversity and divestiture plans.The proceeds would be used for repaying the debt of the company.Future Rating ActionMoody’s can downgrade the ratings provided there is deterioration in the company’s earnings, declines in liquidity or a rising risk of payment failure or wearing off credit recovery potential.The agency could upgrade the ratings if operational initiatives result in better volume growth as well as margin expansion. Also, declining leverage or improving free cash flow by dint of which, Community Health’s ability to refinance future debt maturities along with sustaining the current capital structure might lead to rating upgrade.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 13.38% quarter to date, outperforming its industry’s growth of 7.73%. Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical industry might take a look at a few better-ranked stocks, namely WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report).WellCare offers managed care services for government-sponsored health care programs.

8,ANTM,"On Jun 19, President Donald Trump and his team made the final move toward affordable health plans for small businesses across the United States. The development originates from the executive order that Trump had signed in October 2017. The motive of such an order was to provide alternatives to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.The move is touted to assist small businesses that are vulnerable to the rise in healthcare costs. Further, approximately 11 million citizens of America, working for such firms would benefit from this development. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans. Under such circumstances, investors should consider betting on health insurance stocks.Terms of the New OrderThe U.S. Department of Labor presented the Republican answer to Obamacare earlier this week. The Association Health Plans (AHP) aims to provide the same healthcare benefits to employees of smaller companies that are enjoyed by workers of bigger businesses. Such a provision provides small firms the power to negotiate costs and flexibility of healthcare coverage. The plan will come into effect on September 1.Under the new plan, companies as well as individuals located in the same region or involved in similar businesses are allowed to form associations. Moreover, just like large employer group plans, AHPs would not be required to necessarily cover 10 types of essential benefits, including hospitalization, drugs and maternity care. Such requirements were compulsory under Obamacare.However, other ACA rules, such as the out-of-pocket maximum (OOP) that an individual has to pay in a year, bans on lifetime maximums and annual limits, would be applicable to AHPs. Moreover, preventive care services would be treated the way they were under ACA, wherein the beneficiary would not have to pay the OOP. Finally, the provision also ensures that coverage would not depend on how healthy or sick a beneficiary is.Small Retailers and Restaurants to Purchase More Health PlansAs a result, local restaurants and retailers from a specific area would form groups to participate in Small Business Health Plan. This not only provides cheap insurance but also boosts overall sales of health plans.From 2006 through 2016, there was a dip in health plan sales to a paltry 56% of all small business employees due to rising healthcare costs. Provisions under the AHP tackles this by allowing health policies to be available at extremely affordable prices. Most importantly, it allows such businesses to choose and create their own health plans to suit their needs.Experts believe that accessibility to affordable healthcare stems from the fact the people should have the ability and freedom to choose the coverage that suits their requirements. Increased federal spending and imposition of mandates only reduce the ability to insure one self.4 Best ChoicesTrump’s latest order to provide an alternative to the ACA would provide millions of Americans the freedom to choose their own health policies. Small business owners and retailers participating in group health plans would witness a reduction in administrative costs arising out of economies of scale. Such developments would not only improve the ability to insure oneself but also boost the overall sales of insurance policies.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

9,ANTM,"A strong U.S. economy has enabled the health insurance industry to stand in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and a gradual wage increase bode well for this space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by insurers.Rising enrollment and top-line growth,  increasing contribution from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, demographic changes, expansion of international operations, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, mergers and acquisitions plus healthy balance sheets have long sustained the mojo for health insurers. The overall bullish scenario reinforces our sentiment to believe that the growth cadence for the sector should continue in the long run.Per a McKinsey & Co. report, the private payor market in North America is expected to grow from €583 billion in 2010 to €1,421 billion in 2025.Furthermore, health insurance is one industry, which remains unperturbed by the flaring trade wars and volatile oil prices, causing indexes to fluctuate wildly. Hence, it has performed quite well compared with the broader markets.The industry has rallied 13.3% year to date, more than thrice the 4% increase clocked by the S&P 500 index. The buoyancy in the health insurance space is further confirmed by its  Zacks Industry Rank within the top 40% (102 of the 256 plus groups). In such a situation, it is a wise idea to invest in health insurance companies.Some stocks promising sturdy growth in this flourishing industry are Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report).While Humana, Anthem and Triple-S carry a respective Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), WellCare sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s indulge in a comparative analysis of two health insurers — Anthem and Humana — to decide which is a better stock.While Humana has a market capitalization of $42 billion, the same for Anthem is $62.3 billion.As both staffing firms hold the same robust Zacks Rank, we are using certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Humana’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 8.9% compared with 23.4% rise for Anthem. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Humana’s earnings are estimated at 19.5% growth while the same for Anthem is expected to increase 27.9%.Thus, Anthem has an edge over Humana in terms of quarterly and annual earnings growth projections.Earnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise history helps investors derive an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Both Humana and Anthem boast a decent earnings surprise history with the metric having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four reported quarters for each company.However, Anthem visibly has a vantage point over Humana in terms of its average positive earnings surprise, which reads 7.2%. While Humana’s average beat stands below at 6.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin aids investors to evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency. It also shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin TTM net margin, Anthem compares favorably with the Humana’s ROE of 3.3%. Though both companies lag the industry’s 4.9% TTM net margin, Anthem still commands a better margin profile.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used for measuring a company's value in relation to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is preferred to a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Anthem and Humana is 15.2 and 19.8, respectively, while that of the industry is 17.9.Going a step further and baking in both the companies’ growth rates shows a 12-month PEG ratio of 1.44 for Humana and 1.30 for Anthem compared with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.37.This clearly shows that Anthem is more valued than Humana.  Bottom LineOur comparative assessment shows that Anthem is much better placed than Humana on all fronts.From a fundamental perspective too, Anthem dwells on a firmer ground with guidance raised for 2018, increased membership strength, a sound balance sheet, numerous accretive acquisitions as well as growth in service business, which seem to drive the stock in the coming months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

10,ANTM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Aspire Health, a non-hospice, community-based palliative care provider. The deal is aimed at providing unique and innovative medical care to the community outside hospitals.The company anticipates the buyout to be neutral to current-year earnings but accretive to the bottom line in 2019.Aspire Health provides services under contracts with above 20 health plans to patients across 25 U.S. states. The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire Health would enable it to enhance its medical care business, providing better services along with other clinical care assets, namely CareMore Health and AIM Specialty Health. Through this transaction, Anthem plans to introduce advanced illness programs to deliver optimum patient satisfaction via home-based care, reducing medical costs in the process.Palliative care is fast gaining ground as the U.S. healthcare system shifts to value based care from a volume based one. The consolidation should aid Anthem to dispense treatment affordable costs to patients with complex medical conditions. Thus this move might effectively lower overall medical costs, boosting margin expansion in the process.The Aspire Health deal is projected to be a kind of vertical integration for Anthem and will craft it into a more wholesome and integrated healthcare service provider.Vertical tie-ups are anyways in vogue in the healthcare industry with two mega deals comprising Express Scripts Holding Company by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) being already underway. Both these transactions are the combination of a health insurer with a pharmacy benefit manager.Year to date, the stock has gained 8.5% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.8%. Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

11,ANTM,"Growing trade and tariff talks between the United States and many other countries across the globe has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks, which offer income and stability.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 10 stocks that fit the bill:Delaware-based Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) provides performance chemicals in North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. It has an estimated earnings growth rate of 48.95% for this year and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11.86% in the past four quarters.

12,ANTM,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investor Service recently assigned an A3 senior unsecured debt rating to the planned issuance of around $4 billion senior unsecured debt of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report). The total amount is due in June 2021, 2023, 2028 and 2048. The rating outlook stays stable.Net proceeds from the same would be used for repaying commercial paper borrowings as well as general corporate expenditure of the company (that might consist of redeeming or repurchasing outstanding securities or refinancing debt).Ratings RepresentationThe credit rating agency expects the proceeds to be primarily used for paying back $4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of Mar 31, 2018. As such there should not be any considerable change in the company’s indebtedness.Moody’s debt-to-capital was 42.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, above the high end of its rating expectation. Moreover, the agency notes that the $4.9 billion worth acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which is expected to be closed in 2018, would be paid through a combination of commercial paper, cash and debt. This acquisition will effectively increase the leverage ratio of the company to more than 44%, lying above the rating agency’s benchmark.As on Mar 31, the parent company had $587 million in cash and cash equivalents.The A3 senior unsecured debt rating and A1 insurance financial strength rating of UnitedHealthare based on its  strong business profile, primarily driven by its national presence, brand value, membership base, diverse benefits and services product offerings as well as an impressive level of unregulated revenues.The ratings also find support in a solid financial profile characterized by a steady, consistent earnings performance, a conservative and well-diversified investment portfolio plus a strong interest coverage from both regulated and unregulated operations. However, all these are partially offset by the aforementioned high leverage and a significant amount of goodwill and intangibles from past acquisitions.Factors That May Lead to  Rating ChangePer Moody’s, the ratings of the company may be upgraded if its financial leverage is maintained below 35%, EBITDA interest coverage is above 15x and a consolidated risk-based capital ratio is more than 275% of company action level.Additionally, the ratings can get downgraded if the financial leverage of the company is maintained above 40%, the RBC (risk-based capital) ratio is sustained below 250% of CAL as well as with a significant write-down or increased likelihood of goodwill or intangibles.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has surged nearly 40.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 34.6%. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Medical-HMO industry can also check out some other top-ranked stocks like WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

14,ANTM,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) the health insurer major has carved a niche for itself in the health care industry by building up pieces of businesses that has given it enormous diversification benefits, both across product and geography.UnitedHealth’s business diversification has been achieved by fortifying its health service business, Optum, which over the years has grown to claim a greater share of the company’s total revenues. One of the main reasons for the company to nurture this business was that it remained largely insulated from the regulation which is applicable to another segment UnitedHealthcare, still the major contributor to total revenues.UnitedHealth has complemented its organic growth with targeted acquisitions that have helped it to achieve more in much lesser time. Its Optum business which provides services via three business segments — OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx — provide service capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health management, health care delivery and health care operations. Together, these capabilities represent a $1.4 trillion market opportunity, which implies huge growth for years to come.Coming to the other segment, UnitedHealthcare, has grown organically by more than 12 million people domestically since 2010, achieved via balanced, vibrant growth, serving increasingly diverse markets. The growth profile should continue given the company’s strong standing in the government business, which presents immense potential.  UnitedHealth is also one such company that has been able to lower medical cost for its customers via Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). These ACOs are groups of providers that are paid on the quality of service provided and not on the quantity of service provided as prevailed earlier.The company currently delivers more than $60 billion in care annually through contracts, with value-based features and is on course to raise that number to $75 billion by 2020.We expect the company’s impressive growth to continue as it remains an active acquirer of other businesses to strengthen an existing business or platform or provide a new platform for future growth or avail tools, technologies or skills that cannot be otherwise obtained or developed more efficiently.Moreover, in 2018 and beyond, we see the potential for sustained growth across markets served by the company, particularly in expanding government programs.Also, UnitedHealth remains the frontrunner in applying digital tools and data for health decision-making for its consumers. It is also using blockchain technology in its operations, which should enhance its overall business efficiency.Year to date, the stock has gained 14% compared with the industry’s growth of 12%. Its performance looks better than the growth of 4% and 5% for Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc.

17,ANTM,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

19,ANTM,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) has been consistently grabbing investors’ attention, increasing their confidence in the stock’s strong operational performance.This trend is likely to continue, driven by a recent announcement of acquisitions and the receipt of Medicaid contracts. Continuing with its strong operating performance from the past many years into the first quarter as well, Centene reported solid top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at the end of the last reported quarter increased 6% while revenues were up 13% and earnings per share, soared 94%. The company’s efficiency and investors’ high expectations have led the stock to rally 18%, more than double the industry’s growth of 7.8% year to date.   The stock has also delivered a solid performance compared with other players like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively up 12.8% and 1.3%, while shares of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) have slipped 0.8%, year to date. What Led to the Surge The company dominates as a market leader in the Medicaid business. It was awarded state Medicaid contract in New Mexico earlier this January, in March at Arizona and in Iowa last month. A subsidiary of the company was also granted a correctional healthcare contract in Tucson, AZ. Its Washington unit is also selected for the Medicaid contract. These approvals will likely further drive the company’s revenues from this line of business. Investors favorably view the recent buyouts of the company, which are expected to expand its business and strengthen the services offerings portfolio besides contributing to its inorganic growth. In this vein, the company acquired MHM Servcies, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to conventional systems and other governmental agencies. This consolidation adds one new state to Centene's current portfolio of13 states.In March 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), representing the company’s targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. Apart from CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services should enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to use its cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost as well as the affordable drug-impacted medical cost.Also in March, the company purchased an additional 61% investment stake in Interpreta. It is an innovative health IT company, focused on clinical and genomic data plus real-time analytics.These transactions testify Centene’s continued execution of its diversification strategy. As a strategic move, this in turn would cement its position as a healthcare enterprise and a leader in government-sponsored healthcare.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

20,ANTM,"In its concerted efforts to enhance shareholder value, the board of directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will propose a 20% increase on the quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share. Shareholders as of record on Jun 18, 2018 are expected to get the meatier dividend on Jun 26, 2018.Last June too, the company had hiked its payout by same percentage from 62.5 cents to 75 cents. UnitedHealth has an impressive track record of disbursing quarterly dividends and raising the payout annually, thus witnessing a five-year CAGR of 35.78%.The company’s current dividend yield of 1.21% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.Apart from higher dividends, this diversified health and well-being company’s share repurchase program has also been renewed for lowering share counts and boosting its bottom line. The company has been authorized to buy back 100 million shares or approximately 10% of its outstanding shares. This decision by UnitedHealth’s board members would replace the Jun 2014 share buyback program under which, there were around 29 million shares left for repurchase as of May 31, 2018.This dividend hike is supported by the company's strong balance sheet with increasing cash flows from the past several years (except 2013), a trend which continued in the first quarter of 2018 (cash flow from operations soared 60% year over year).The company has been quite aggressive when it comes to share buybacks.

22,ANTM,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service has placed a downgrade rating review of Ba2 senior debt rating for WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) and Baa2 insurance financial strength (""IFS"") rating for its subsidiary WellCare of Florida, Inc.The agency decided to review the ratings after the company announced its intention to acquire Meridian — consisting of Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Inc., Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, Inc. and pharmacy benefits manager, MeridianRx — for a transaction value of $2.5 billion.This strategic move will enable WellCare expand its Medicaid portfolio to as many as 13 states with a leading market share across six of the lot.Factors Driving Rating ActionThe rating agency is concerned about the increase in leverage ratio due to usage of debt to fund the Meridian buyout. It estimates the company’s debt-to-equity ratio to deteriorate from 35% as of Mar 31, 2018 to 44% or above, depending on the amount of debt issues. The company is expected to issue debt worth $0.6 billion and $1 billion and draw on the revolver credit of up to $400 million.WellCare’s debt-to-EBITDA is supposed to increase from 1.9x to 2.8x. A significant amount of goodwill is also expected to increase along with the decline of EBITDA coverage of interest income.Additionally, standard integrations risks associated with this kind of large-scale acquisition is another concern.However, Meridian’s consolidation will likely prove accretive and improve WellCare’s scale and geographic diversification.Moody’s might review its current ratings downgrade when the deal draws to a close or prior to that if additional information allows the rating giant to reach a particular conclusion. Moreover, the agency wants to analyze Meridian’s financial performance in order to understand its financial plans.WellCare gave an indication to bring adjusted debt-to-capital ratio below 40% within a year of the transaction’s completion date. This will be achieved by paying a revolving credit line used for financing the deal along with increasing retained earnings.The ratings of the company have been a reflection of its decent demographic presence, consistent growth, solid capital levels and a low leverage, relative to peers. However, factors like lack of non-risk business, relatively small size and government business concentration are partial offsets.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 13.39% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rise of 7.8%. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Medical-HMO industry can also check out other stocks worth considering like Anthem, Inc.

23,ANTM,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) has completed the sale of 60-bed Byrd Regional Hospital and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of the Allegiance Health Management. The transaction took place on Jun 1, 2018.This move came in sync with the company’s planned divestitures, discussed on first-quarter 2018’s earnings call.In addition, the company sold 85-bed Tennova Healthcare Jamestown in Jamestown, TN along with its associated assets to units of Rennova Health, Inc. The transaction was effective Jun 1, 2018.Community Health has been consistently divesting hospitals in order to strengthen its portfolio. It is currently focusing on its core business by selling of non-core assets or those generating inadequate profitability. In 2017, the company sold as many as 30 hospitals as part of its portfolio rationalization efforts. Additionally, the company divested a hospital in Dade City and agreed to sell assets of Ocala, Florida Hospital in April 2018.Community Health intends to divest hospitals this year, which accounted for $2 billion revenues and mid-single-digit EBITDA margin in 2017.

In 2016, the debt level decreased 10% year over year followed by a 6% fall in 2017. Further, it was lowered 8.9% at the end of first-quarter 2018.In the past six months, although this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry’s rally of 20.5% with a 3.6% gain of its share price value, favorable factors like price impact, strong divestitures, inorganic growth and a declining debt level are likely to help the stock bounce back going forward.  Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players from the medical industry are Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc.

24,ANTM,"Dividend investing is once again in vogue thanks to growing political and geopolitical tensions as well as renewed concerns of trade war. In fact, investors are chasing both growth and income in their portfolio. This can be achieved by zeroing in on companies that not only offer dividends but have also have consistently increasing their payout.  Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth make an investor’s portfolio immune to large swings in stock prices in turbulent times, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks pose a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Furthermore, these have a long history of outperformance over the long term. When compared with the ones that pay out high yields, dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio, with more scope for capital appreciation. However, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 14 stocks that fit the bill:Texas-based Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) is a vertically integrated international manufacturer and supplier of petrochemicals, polymers and fabricated products.

25,ANTM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple-S Management (GTS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 31.3% over the past month. GTS hit a new 52-week high of $37.55 in the previous session. Triple-S Management has gained 49.4% since the start of the year compared to the -0.4% move for the Medical sector and the 9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Triple-S Management reported EPS of $0.6 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.93%.For the current fiscal year, Triple-S Management is expected to post earnings of $1.9 per share on $3.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 0.53% change in EPS on a 4.89% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.2 per share on $3.17 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.79% and 4.27%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTriple-S Management may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for GTS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Triple-S Management has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.9X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus | Triple-S Management Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Triple-S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Triple-S Management passes the test. Thus, it seems as though GTS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Triple-S Management Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Triple-S Management have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including WellCare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), and Chemed (CHE  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

(UHS  -  Free Report) owns and operates outpatient facilities, acute care hospitals plus behavioral healthcare facilities along with its subsidiaries.The company flaunts a favorable VGM Score of A.

The company is expected to retain its revenue momentum in the future as well, backed by a robust performance across all its segments.Strong Performance of the Acute-Care Segment: The company has been experiencing a sturdy rise in this segment since 2012. Acute care mainly focuses on providing short-term healthcare to patients requiring urgent attention. Under this segment, the average number of licensed beds in the hospitals has been increasing, boosting the company’s revenues in turn.

Last reported quarter, the trend continued with 4% improvement.Solid Performance of the Behavioral Segment: Focusing on treating patients with eating disorders, sexual trauma, disorderliness and autism, the Behavioral platform has witnessed a spurt in the number of licensed beds since 2012.

Sound acquisitions in this segment have also led to growth in the addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment is likely to grow in the upcoming quarters as well, backed by the new laws.Underpriced: Shares of United Health Services are undervalued at the moment, which is a highly attractive proposition for investors. The company has a trailing 12-month price-to-equity ratio of 14.53, falling below the industry’s average of 15.07.Price Performance: In a year’s time, shares of the company have gained 1.35%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rise of 13.12%. However, the strong fundamentals are anticipated to drive the stock higher in the upcoming quarters.Acquisitions: The company’s buyout of adult services division of Cambian group in 2016 is assumed to expand the company’s presence in the U.K. along with its market presence in Nevada, courtesy of the Desert View Hospital purchase. The company is projected to widen its international base with more such integrations in the future.Profitability: The return-on-equity (ROE) of the company stands at 15.2%, comparing favorably with the industry average of (193.1)%, thereby underlying the stock’s growth potential. This also shows the company’s efficient usage of its shareholders’ funds.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $9.41, representing a year-over-year increase of 24.97% on 4.42% higher revenues of $10.87 billion.For 2019, the consensus estimate for earnings per share stands at $10.20 on revenues of $11.4 billion, translating into a respective 8.46% and 5.15% year-over-year rise.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Medical industry are WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

27,ANTM,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only seven.Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) is a health care company. It provides medical products through its subsidiaries. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 7.2%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report) is a regionally accredited provider of online postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in its core disciplines of education, business, and healthcare.

28,ANTM,"Shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $33.67 in yesterday’s trading session before closing a tad lower at $33.50, generating a skyrocketing year-to-date rate of nearly 121%. The stock has therefore substantially outperformed the industry’s 12.5% rally. This uptrend was primarily driven by the company’s solid performance in the first quarter and its raised guidance for 2018. We believe this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to possess great growth potential, which is also apparent from its favorable Growth Score of B. Its long-term earnings growth rate stands at 13%.Now let’s dig deeper to analyze the reasons behind the company’s stock appreciation.Solid 1Q18 Results: Tenet’s shares have surged 39.9%, ever since the diversified healthcare services company exhibited a sturdy performance in all its segments.  The bottom line of 57 cents per share came in against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and rebounded from the previous year’s loss of 27 cents.Banking on first-quarter outperformance, the company raised its 2018 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are projected between $1.36 and $1.70, up from the earlier expectation of 73 cents-$1.07. Revenues are estimated in the range of $17.9-$18.3 billion. Tenet Healthcare anticipates adjusted free cash flow of $725-$925 million, up from $675-$875 million. It also lifted the upper end of the outlook provided for net cash from operating activities by $0.1 billion and now predicts the same between $1.245 billion and $1.550 billion.Executive Appointments: On May 16, Tenet announced to have appointed Paola Arbour as Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer and Marie Quintana as Senior Vice President and the Chief Marketing Officer. The expertise and knowledge of both should drive the company's performance in the future.Rating Upgrade: Recently, Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the B2 Corporate Family Rating and B2-PD Probability of Default Rating, senior secured rating of Ba3, Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating of SGL-2 and unsecured rating of Caa1. The rating agency upgraded the outlook to stable from negative to account for the benefits of $250 million derived from cost-reduction plan as well as a slight recovery in patient volumes.To wrap up, the above-mentioned factors along with the company’s core strength are likely to help Tenet continue its bull run.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors looking for other stocks worth considering from the same industry might also check out WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

29,ANTM,"Though the prospect of faster-than-expected rates hikes and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal of dividend stocks, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns in a rising rate environment.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth are usually of high quality and deliver excellent risk-adjusted returns in the longer term. When compared with the ones that pay out high yields, dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio, with more scope for capital appreciation.Inside Dividend Growth StocksStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks pose a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Furthermore, these have a long history of outperformance over the long term. However, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:California-based Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.

These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Triple-S Management has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.4X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus | Triple-S Management Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Triple-S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Triple-S Management passes the test. Thus, it seems as though GTS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Triple-S Management Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Triple-S Management have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including WellCare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

34,ANTM,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are six of the eight stocks that made it through the screen:Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report) is a regionally accredited provider of online postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in its core disciplines of education, business, and healthcare.

35,ANTM,"Teladoc, Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) gains traction from a strong first-quarter 2018 earnings release as well as a solid guidance. The stock hit a 52 week-high of $47.15 on Thursday.What Drives the Stock?This telehealth service provider rides high on an inorganic growth profile, strong demand for its telehealth services, an increasing clientele base and a gradual march toward a breakeven profitability. All these factors have held stock in a good shape.Since the release of the company’s results on May 1, 2018, shares have rallied 22%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2%. In a year’s time, the sock has returned 60%, significantly higher than the industry’s rise of 9.3%. Let’s look at the catalysts for this bull run:Investors note that the company is in growing stage and the consistent bottom-line losses over the past several quarters are a result of heavy expenditures incurred on marketing and substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build a proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop technology platform.All the more encouraging is that these investments are reaping fruits, reflected by a strong increase in membership, visits and client base. These upsides have contributed to an upsurge in revenues at the company, which has witnessed a CAGR of 74% during the 2014-2017 period. The top line skyrocketed 109% year over year in the first quarter of 2018.  The company’s inorganic strategies have provided enough fuel to its overall growth. A number of acquisitions, namely Best Doctors, HealthiestYou, StatDoc and BetterHelp completed in the past three years have enhanced growth in membership and visits. Both metrics registered a CAGR of 42% and 70%, respectively, during the 2014-2017 phase. The two were also up 41% and 57%, each in the first quarter.Investors are also confident about a decline in the expenditures with the company gradually starting to realize leverage from the scale of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported a positive EBIDTA (first ever since its IPO), which shows that it is on track to achieve a bottom-line profitability. Though the company posted a negative EBIDTA in first-quarter 2018, management has issued a positive guidance for adjusted EBIDTA in the second quarter and also for the full year.Stock’s Unique Position in a Thriving IndustryTeladoc is fast gaining ground in the rapidly growing telehealth services industry in the United States with ample scope for flourish owing to concerning health care cost following inefficient care, duplication of services, significant waste and extreme variation in access, cost and quality of care.Teladoc can address this inefficiency in care by providing superior quality of care through a platform that caters to consumer demand and physician availability in real-time and in various modalities such as video, web, mobile and telephone. Moreover, the emergence of technology via big data and analytics, cloud-based solutions, online video and mobile applications offers the company with huge opportunity for growth.Will the Stock Rally Further?The company’s upbeat guidance for 2018 further lends a positive insight into its performance going forward, which in turn should support the stock price rise.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Teladoc carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the medical space are Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (CRL  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc.

Moreover, the bottom line improved 17.7% from the prior-year quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. Quote The year-over-year improvement in earnings was attributable to strong performance across the company’s core businesses. Also, a favorable prior-year reserve development more than offset higher-than-expected flu-related medical costs.Soft RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $15.22 billion, which declined 1.7% from the year-ago figure of $15.49 billion. This downside was primarily driven by the company’s divested domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses during fourth-quarter 2017. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher adjusted revenues in the Health Care segment.Total expense ratio of 17.9% increased 190 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 10.1% expanded slightly by 10 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 47.9 million from 50.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Segmental Performance UpdateStarting from first-quarter 2018, Aetna realigned its business segments in order to be consistent with the changes brought in its management structure and internal management reporting. On the basis of this realignment, the company will now conduct its operations in the Health Care segment.The company will provide the remaining portion of its financial results in the Corporate/Other category.Health CareAdjusted revenues were $15.1 billion, up 2% year over year. This upside was attributable to higher membership in the company’s Medicare products, a positive impact of the reinstatement of HIF (Health Insurer Fee) in 2018 along with taking on the new accounting guidance with regard to revenue recognition for the quarter under review. However, lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products as well as the company’s Medicaid products, partially offset this upside.Pre-tax adjusted earnings of $1.5 million remained flat year over year on higher membership in Medicare products and previously announced exit from individual Commercial products. However, lower membership in Aetna’s Commercial and Medicaid products substantially offset the upside.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) fell 210 basis points year over year to 80.4% due to higher medical costs, attributable to a more severe flu season during the reported quarter compared with the prior-year period.Financial PositionTotal assets were $59.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 7.3% year over year.Long-term debt decreased 4.6% year over year to $7.8 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.8% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 37% as of Dec 31, 2017.Zacks RankAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Health Maintenance OrganizationsAmong other players from the industry having reported first-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of Anthem, Inc.

This downside was primarily caused by a reduced footprint in the Individual ACA (Affordable Care Act)-compliant marketplace.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 81.5% improved 220 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 and an improved medical cost performance across all its business segments.SG&A expense ratio of 15.3% deteriorated 100 bps from the year-ago quarter due to return of the health insurance tax in 2018 and the impact of an increased investment spend this year to support growth initiatives.Segment UpdateCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $9 billion in the first quarter, down 12% year over year.Operating gain totaled $1.4 billion, up 8.1% year over year owing to Penn Treaty assessments recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and an improved medical cost performance.Operating margin was 15.5%, down 280 bps year over year.Government BusinessOperating revenues were $13.3 billion in the first quarter, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.Operating gain was $490.9 million, up 54.1% year over year.

51,ANTM,"The first-quarter earnings season is unwinding fast with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index already having reported financial numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25% increase in total earnings on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front.The Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to deliver 9.4% earnings growth on 6.8% higher revenues in the first quarter. This is, however, shy of the projected 18.3% and 7.7% revenue and earnings growth, respectively, for the S&P 500 index.Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector, which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations (HMOs) popularly known as health insurers, clinical, laboratories and diagnostics research, medical equipment, hospitals & nursing homes, telehealth services and more. The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing a sector positively can be a negative for the other sector. For example flu, which causes an increase in medical services utilization, is an earnings driver for the hospital sector while at the same time a negative factor for insurers it causes a spike in claim costs.  To put it into perspective, the January-to-March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season, which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers. But because of UnitedHealth’s superior medical cost management, the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company’s results. UnitedHealth is considered to be a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu, the first quarter will be profitable.The health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses – Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies. Earnings should also see an upside from ancilliary and health service businesses, which the health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify the revenue base. These businesses which focus on data management, management of clinical records, analytics, clinical care, pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group’s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.However, this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain, as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales. Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help, which in turn should drive their top-line growth.Nevertheless, the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat, from walk-in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters.Let’s find out where the following healthcare stocks insurers stand ahead of their first-quarter releases on Apr 25.Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) revenues have been consistently growing over the past several quarters, driven by membership growth. The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of nearly 1%.The company’s Government business has been performing well over a considerable period of time, supported by increasing Medicaid and Medicare enrollment. The consensus mark for total operating revenues of Government business is pegged at $12.8 billion, up 7% year over year.However, higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products and more claims leading to an escalated benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 3.6% year-over-year growth. Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of -1.83%, makes surprise prediction unlikely as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

54,ANTM,"We believe UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) health services business Optum will be an important ingredient of its first-quarter earnings growth. Optum serves the global healthcare marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers.The company is investing in this segment with an aim to diversify earnings and seek protection from the highly regulated health services business. Other companies in the industry, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) are also diversifying into the health services business to become a comprehensive healthcare entity.  Optum has been a jewel for UnitedHealth. Its revenue CAGR of 24% from 2014 to 2017 is highly impressive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment is $23.6 billion, up 11.3% year over year.Revenue growth from this segment should be driven by increased contribution from each of its sub-segments, OptumHealth, OptumInsight, Optum Rx.Revenues from OptumHealth should be aided by organic growth acquisition-related growth in care delivery.

55,ANTM,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has decided to raise 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4%. Notably, CMS previously proposed a hike of 1.84% in February but this rate increase is higher than expected.Following the announcement, shares of companies with exposure to the MA business like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) rallied.Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans were initiated by the government some years ago to control the rising cost of Medicare, a government program for the retirees. Notably, this MA plans were administered by private insurance companies. The health insurers often add extra benefits to make these plans more appealing to consumers, thus justifying its name — Medicare Advantage. The government reimburses a certain amount per enrolee to the health insurers in return of the care provided.Why Is Government Pitching for High Reimbursement Rates?MA reimbursement rates for private plan increased by 0.45%, 0.85% for 2018, and, 2017, respectively. The higher-than-expected increase in reimbursement rate for 2019 is meant  to attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing managed care participation. This move will alleviate government healthcare which is reeling under high Medicare costs.According to CBO, total Medicare spending is expected to increase from $708 billion to $1.4 trillion from 2017 to 2027.  Medicare spending is anticipated to rise more rapidly relative to GDP owing to a number of factors, including the aging population and faster growth in health care costs compared with growth in the economy on a per capita basis. In an effort to decrease the government’s burden of rising healthcare costs, it intends to rope in health insurers who are effective in managing costs.In fact, the government has actually witnessed cost reduction by delegating Medicare to the private players and is encouraging customers to opt for Medicare Advantage. The recent higher-than-expected rate highlights the government’s efforts to stabilize these plans and provide enough resources to the insurance companies to support beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicare plans.A Cash Cow for Health InsurersMeanwhile, these plans have been highly profitable for the health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members. This trend has aided top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Further, the health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be boon for the health insurance industry.In a year’s time the industry has gained 33.7% compared with the S&P 500 growth of 11.9%.MA — the Catalyst Behind Mergers and Acquisitions in the IndustryThe lucrative nature of this business along with the players’ intention to stake a claim in this rapidly growing market has fueled a number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.According to KPMG, MA has only been around since 2003 but it is rapidly gaining popularity as a health plan and also among seniors dissatisfied with traditional Medicare. MA plans are in great demand amid the baby boomers, a rapidly growing generation, presenting an immense business opportunity.  KPMG projects the baby boomers population to be nearly 72 million by 2030 and almost 87 million by 2050. Per Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux, 11,000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population ever single day.Analysis from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, projects annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US$215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than $500 billion by 2025.The most recent merger speculation doing rounds is that of Walmart’s intention to buy Humana (which has nearly two thirds of its revenues coming from MA). Notably, this buyout also hinges around the coveted MA business. Its crystal clear that Walmart is planning to cash in on the MA business via Humana, an established player in this field.Recently Anthem stated that it is working to capture its fair share of the MA market.Other big acquisitions in this arena in  were UnitedHealth Group’s buyout of XLHealth Corporation, Preferred Care Partners and Medica HealthCare Plans. Further, Cigna's acquisition of HealthSpring, Humana’s takeover  of MD Care and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are also noteworthy.  In the same vein, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. acquired Universal American Corp. last year and is still on hunt for MA opportunities.Bottom LineGiven that MA is one of the few areas which has a bipartisan support, its future remains bright. Industry analysts believe that the recent increase in reimbursement rates will lead to strong enrollment growth in this business in next five years.Also the players thirst for MA business still remains unquenched; consequently we expect more mergers and acquisitions on this front.Among the companies discussed above UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Anthem, Humana and Aetna all carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

56,ANTM,"Speculation is rife that retail major Walmart will acquire health insurer Humana. Walmart is not the first retailer showing interest in the healthcare space. Recently, Amazon entered into joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees. The company also expressed acute interest in pharmacy business.Retailers have upped their ante for the nearly $3-trillion healthcare sector, which accounts for approximately 18% of U.S. GDP. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states that total healthcare spending in the United States climbed to $3.4 trillion in 2016 and is expected to reach $5.5 trillion by 2020. The sheer size of this ever-growing market, which is much in need of innovation, has attracted retailers that are always sniffing out business opportunities. And retailers are right in doing so for there is little doubt that spending on medical care will continue to rise.Despite huge sums of money spent on healthcare in the United States (the costliest in the world), the system is stymied with administrative inefficiencies, opaque prices and customer dissatisfaction. Warren Buffett recently made a statement that has gone viral: “The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.” These inconsistencies provide smart businesses with solid opportunity.Not just retailers, other household names like Apple, Uber and Google, with their unique technologies have also expressed their intention to make it big in the healthcare space.How Walmart is StrategizingWalmart, having a market capitalization of nearly $263 billion, is aiming to diversify into healthcare, to drive more traffic to its 4,700 U.S. stores.Acquiring Humana could help Walmart jump-start this effort and give it greater clout in the healthcare industry, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research center.Walmart is not new to the healthcare business. It already runs a large pharmacy business with outlets in many of its stores. Now, Walmart is eyeing the lucrative medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population. Per Kantar Consulting, Walmart’s shoppers mix has an average age of more than 50 years. A better way to generate revenues from this customer base would be to sell them their desired healthcare product/services.For Walmart, Humana seems the best fit given that both entities have been in partnership for eight years for selling co-branded prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients. This leads to savings on certain drugs bought at Walmart’s pharmacies. Humana’s clinics along with Walmart pharmacies should provide the companies great cross-selling opportunities.Walmart is now exploring ways to extend this relationship with Humana and market participants are anticipating a merger between them. The rationale for a merger looks even more compelling against the backdrop of increased risk of losing out to Amazon, which has already dipped its feet into the healthcare space. Walmart is already faced with waning brick-and-mortar sales given significant competition from online sales posed by Amazon. An early entry via an established player in the healthcare space will help Walmart save its ground.  How is Amazon Playing?Recently, CNBC in one of its reports, stated that Amazon’s entry into healthcare is no more than speculation. Recent actions by Amazon, which includes searching for a CEO to lead its healthcare joint venture formed with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway, planning something big in the pharmacy space, and a provision to offer its services to healthcare customers via its cloud business, AWS, corroborates its headway in healthcare.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon had expressed his healthcare bent at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in October 2016. He had said, “I think healthcare is going to be one of those industries that is elevated and made better by machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I actually think Echo and Alexa do have a role to play in that.”Disruption in the Cards?There is no doubt that the entry of these retailers (especially Amazon which has successfully turned the tide in its favor in whatever business it has laid its hands on till now) will widely unsettle the healthcare sector.These retailers, with their established brand, huge customer data, cutting-edge technology, and superior product and services, should lead to a radical healthcare transformation. It is expected that the solutions created by them will to a large extent solve the three main challenges of the healthcare sector— access, quality and cost.  A shift from “one size fits all care treatment” to “tailor made care” should be in vogue, as these customer-centric companies try to design customer-specific products and services compared with traditional healthcare players that have hardly ever extended such care to customers.Considering the health insurance industry, which was concentrated with a handful of big players who commanded product pricing and service offerings and had an upper hand in dealing with customers, will find themselves in a radically changed scenario. Players in this space have already had to make fundamental changes in their business operations and attitude since the enactment of Obamacare in 2010 that put a check on malpractices to protect customers’ interest. Now, the entry of players that are already well-established in their own fields and enjoy customer loyalty, will give the traditional healthcare players a jolt.The need of the hour for healthcare entities is razor-sharp focus on innovation and service to protect their share in the market that they have ruled for ages. What’s more, they must do so to save their space from retail invasion.However, these changes are not going to happen soon. Major players in this space are still well poised for long-term growth since they have established businesses and know the in and out of it. Only they need to catch up with customers’ needs.Stocks to PickThe healthcare space still looks attractive given that demand for its products and services is ever growing thanks to changing demographic, growing income, low unemployment and jobless claims.

57,ANTM,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is well poised for growth on the back of its recent business-boosting pacts. In March 2018,  it has purchased a stake in cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager, RxAdvance, which should help it to  lower drug costs and provide improved health care services.The stock further looks attractive given its successful acquisition of Health Net, which has led to membership growth, strong medicaid business and a solid balance sheet. Moreover, its pending acquisition of Community Medical Holdings Corp, MHM Services, Inc. and Fidelis Care should drive long-term growth in a highly regulated industry.Estimates of Centene have moved upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and 2019 earnings being revised 22% and 23% upward to $7.07 and $8.13, respectively.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have outperformed its industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 54.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 35.1%.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Centene an attractive pick for investors.Solid 2018 Guidance: Centene has issued its earnings guidance for 2018. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to 47.35. This is not only higher than the previous projection of $5.47-$5.87 but also reflects a 42% rise over 2017 earnings. The medical insurer also anticipates operating revenues in the band of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier view of $60.0-$60.8 billion and lying 26% above the value of 2017 revenues. This upbeat outlook further instills shareholders' optimism on the stock.Consistent Top-line Growth: Centene has witnessed steady revenue growth over the past several years (CAGR of 42% from 2012 to 2017). Revenues have followed this uptrend on the back of the company’s solid inorganic strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $61 billion, reflecting 26% year over year growth.Strong Capital Position: Centene’s solid cash position has enabled the company to deploy capital most effectively in order to enhance shareholders’ value. Net cash flow from operations, which has been increasing since 2010 (except for 2017), has financed most of the company’s growth-oriented investments.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Centene boasts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.8%.Attractive Valuation: Going by the price to earnings (P/E) ratio, Centene is trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 14.5x, lower than the industry average of 17.3x.

58,ANTM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Anthem has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Anthem’s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint (which is 13.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Anthem has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Anthem’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Anthem has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Anthem currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ANTM a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F. This gives ANTM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of F. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen nearly 8.0% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased about 10.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Anthem, Inc. Price and Consensus  Anthem, Inc. Price and Consensus | Anthem, Inc. QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting, a decent industry rank (top 38% out of more than 250 industries) a strong Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

59,ANTM,"The recent announcement by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) corroborates the fact that the healthcare industry is shifting gears.The coming together of two different sections (health insurers and the pharmacy benefit managers) of the healthcare space asserts that business boundaries are getting blurred. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive healthcare providers, a one-stop solution for their customers.Recent Spate of DealsThe first deal of this kind was CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna, announced last December. The transaction, valued at nearly $77 billion, is slated to go through in the second half of 2018.  Following this news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) announced the buyout of the primary and urgent care services of DaVita Inc. for nearly $5 billion.However, UnitedHealth can be considered a pioneer in this aspect, having acquired Catamaran, a pharmacy benefit management company in 2015. The buyout has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth and contributed meaningfully to its results.What’s the Driving Factor?Pressure to slash costs to protect margins and the need to counter growing competition are the primary catalysts for the merger and acquisition wave sweeping through the industry.  Insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given that the tech giant, Amazon.com Inc., is making inroads in the pharmacy business. Amazon recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in order to curb medical costs for their employees.Teaming up with other forward or backward integrated companies consequently seems the best survival strategy to provide businesses with additional strength and a wider spectrum.Given the vertical integration nature of these deals, odds of getting a clearance from regulators seem high. Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna’s with Humana were blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both the companies had overlapping businesses.The Impact of These CombinationsPBMs provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services,. It also provides retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. They function to negotiate of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers.Their clients include insurance companies with the focus on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. Tie up with PBMs better equips health insurers to negotiate discount with drug manufacturers which should lower insurers’ medical costs.These combinations should be well-positioned to cater to the health needs of populations especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Getting vertically integrated would better equip health  insurers to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs, by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Consequently along with providing growth opportunities for business these evolving entities would also better serve customers. Such changes therefore bode well for both the consumers and the producers.U. S. healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs, a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve. Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs.Promising Stock PicksWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 34.5% in a year’s time. Adding these stocks to an investment portfolio is likely to fetch smart returns.Centene Corp.

61,ANTM,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) has announced that it will buy Express Scripts Holding Co., (ESRX  -  Free Report) a pharmacy benefits provider and other medical servcies.The deal, valued $67 billion, will be financed by a mix of cash and debt. It will be one of the biggest deals for Cigna. What’s in the Offing for Cigna?The deal is expected to be mutually beneficial, given that it would lead to a solid combination of Cigna’s strong position and expertise in the health benefits space with Express Scripts’ leading position in the pharmacy benefits market (PBM).This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drugs to insurance cover.The deal will add to Cigna’s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better. This would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium, thus ultimately leading to market-share gains.    Odds of the deals getting a clearance from regulators seem high, as it will be a vertical integration. Last year, Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) was blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both companies had overlapping businesses. In a year’s time shares of the company have gained 28% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.2%.Growing Trend of Health Insures Catching up with PBMWith this deal, Cigna will be catching up with the growing bandwagon of health insurers tying up with pharmacy benefits mangers. The acquisition of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s leading health insurers, by pharmacy benefit major CVS Health Corp. is already underway. Another deal in the same vein was the takeover of Catamaran by health insurer leader UnitedHealth Group Inc., in 2015.  Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket-pinch for consumers. This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers.Moreover, insurers seek an attractive business opportunity in the PBM market, which largely benefits from an aging population, which depends largely on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above, which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts the continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Consolidation in HealthcareMost economists believe this coming together of two different industries in the healthcare sector will add a new dimension and might help in checking soaring costs.Moreover, necessitated by the need of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry, mergers and acquisitions (both horizontal and vertical) are common. No matter whether a company wishes to grow horizontally (expand in the existing business) or vertically (expand into new business), the most sought-after way is to acquire the best fit.  Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

62,ANTM,"With global awareness on gender diversity, the number of female corporate leaders has gone up in recent years. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017. However, the number declined to 27 as of January 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have outperformed the market. According to analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairperson role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. Annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market — the MSCI World Index.The U.S. stock market is turning nine on Mar 9, representing the second-longest bull run in history after the 1990s rally that ended when the tech bubble burst in 2000.

68,ANTM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has sealed the acquisition of America’s 1st Choice, a privately held, for-profit Medicare Advantage (MA) organization.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2018.Positives for AnthemAmerica’s 1st Choice is a perfect fit for Anthem given its vast presence in Florida, a state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from America’s 1st Choice’s proprietary technology tools, managerial processes and member engagement programs that deliver efficient, cost-effective health care services to its members.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The deal will allow the company to serve more than 130,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has surged 42%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%. Given its progress on fundamentals and strong recent results the rally in the stock should stay alive.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the government-sponsored health insurance for retirees that provides extra benefits and services to seniors, has been in huge demand from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of acquisitions small and big have materialized as the players have been scrambling to grow in this line of business. Some of the notable ones are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The failed mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna with Humana Inc.

This deal will help especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which would have made it one of the largest players in the MA market.  The company recently acquired HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to use and is readily open to attractive acquisitions.

70,ANTM,"Markets began to rebound on Monday after their worst week in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both climbed over 1.30%. Still, analysts are divided over whether the recent sell-off is over just yet.Concern that the Fed will raise interest rates faster than initially expected on the back of the first jobs report of 2018 is one possible reason for the pullback. A simple market correction, amid what has been a historic run, is another possibility.Whatever the case may be, no one is sure if the worst is over right now. With that said, investors should consider looking for stocks that have proven to be less volatile compared to the market as a whole.One tool we can turn to here is a stock’s beta rating, which is a representation of how a security responds to rapid swings in the market. Historically, stocks and securities with betas below 1.0 are less volatile than the market.Let’s look at three low-beta stocks to consider now.1.       Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report)Cigna is an American health and life insurance giant that is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “B” VGM grade. The stock’s earnings estimates have been trending upward on strong revision agreement for the current quarter, current fiscal year, and the following fiscal year.Investors should also be happy to note that Cigna has matched or topped earnings estimates all but once over the last three years. The company’s bottom-line is projected to expand at a healthy annualized rate of 12.90% over the next three to five years. And during these recent uncertain times, Cigna’s beta of 0.45 theoretically presents less volatility compared to the market average.2.       Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report)This off-price department store sells far more than coats, and its name is iconic throughout the industry. Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth and an overall “B” VGM score. Burlington’s beta of 0.48, which is calculated using data over a five-year period, means that the company is less volatile compared to the market as a whole, in theory.Burlington has also been on a hot streak when it comes to topping or meeting earnings expectations. The company has achieved this feat every quarter since the start of 2014, with an average surprise of over 15% in the trailing four periods. Looking down the road, investors should note that Burlington is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 18.65% over the next three to five years.3.       Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report)Analysts have shown strong agreement when it comes to upping earnings estimates for this Indianapolis, Indiana health insurance and HMO powerhouse over the last 60 days. This has helped Anthem earn its current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. The company also boasts an “A” grade for Momentum and has topped quarterly earnings expectations by an average of 9.60% over the last four quarters.Anthem also currently rocks a beta of 0.83, which should help show investors that the HMO provider is a relatively stable investment compared to the average stock on the market. The company also looks poised to steadily grow its bottom-line over the next three to five years, helping further demonstrate its solid overall fundamentals.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

79,ANTM,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings of $1.25 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Earnings, however, declined 23% from the prior-year quarter.The decline in earnings was primarily due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in Aetna's Health Care segment and targeted investment spending on growth initiatives. These were to some extent offset by lower losses in the company’s individual commercial products.Weak RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $14.74 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.89 billion. Also, revenues compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $15.72 billion. The downside was primarily due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment, including lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the Health Insurer Fee  (HIF) in 2017.Total expense ratio of 20.5% declined 240 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 4.8% decreased 160 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 49.4 million from 52.79 million in the year-ago quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteSegmental Performance UpdateHealth CareAdjusted revenues were $14.5 billion, down 4% year over year. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $662 million, down 31.3% year over year due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care costs estimates, higher targeted investment spending on Aetna's growth initiatives and the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017, partially offset by reduced losses in Aetna's individual commercial products.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 220 basis points year over year to 84.3% due to deterioration in Commercial and Government benefit ratios.Group InsuranceDuring the fourth quarter, the company completed the sale of a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses.This sale adversely impacted the quarter’s revenues and pre-tax adjusted earnings of $237 million and $16 million, respectively, which were down 61.8% and 57%, respectively.Large Case PensionsAdjusted revenues came at $71 million, up 11% year over year led by higher premiums in fourth-quarter 2017.Financial PositionTotal assets were $55.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 20% year over year.Long-term debt declined 57% year over year to $8.2 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 37% of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 53.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Business UpdateDuring the quarter, the company sold a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain of approximately $710 million ($1.1 billion pretax).Also, Aetna entered into an agreement, in the quarter, to be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) for nearly $69 billion.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018.Zacks Rank, Peer Performance, Upcoming ReleaseAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

80,ANTM,"In corporate finance, leverage is a well-known business strategy adopted by companies  to borrow funds to finance working capital requirements, acquisitions or for some kind of business expansion. Now, the two most common financial resources corporates resort to are debt and equity. Interestingly, a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity, as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity; especially in periods of low interest rates. This happens because when a company finances its operations with debt, it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a fixed time period.Whereas, in case of equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has its drawbacks. The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant. Especially, at times of high interest rates, companies with large debt loads become more prone to bankruptcy.That said, for the investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since a debt-free corporation is rare to find. Therefore, the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making  an investment decision. Several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is the debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q4 reporting cycle in full swing by now, companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices. However, such growth stocks may also be highly leveraged ones.Since a greater cohort of investors is risk-averse by nature, it is reasonable to expect that they will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Anthem, Inc.

QuoteZacks Rank: Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted the total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $22.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 3%.Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion has also significantly boosted the company’s medical enrollment. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical enrollment is pegged at 40.1 million, up 0.5% year over year.The company’s Government business has also been performing well over past many years, helped by rising Medicaid and medicare enrollment.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total operating revenues from Commercial business is $10.1 billion, up 5.2% year over year.However, higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products and higher claims leading to higher benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line.The company is also likely to have witnessed higher administrative costs in the fourth quarter, continuing the previous trend.The Individual business is also expected to have underperformed in the quarter, weighing on the overall results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the medical sector that you may want to consider as these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter:Centene Corp.

82,ANTM,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 30, is expected to witness a decline in revenues due to lower premiums in its Health Care segment, including lower membership in its ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee (HIF) in 2017.        Revenues from Health Care segment is expected to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter owing to the sale of its domestic life insurance group, group disability insurance and absence management business lines; the previously disclosed Medicaid contract termination; exits from individual Commercial products and continued repositioning of its ACA-compliant small group Commercial products. Management has also reduced its 2017 revenue guidance to approximately $60.5 billion from $61 billion earlier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Health Care segment for the fourth quarter is $14.5 billion, down 3.7% year over year. Medical Benefit Ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, led by an unfavorable performance of Individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the medical benefit ratio, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the company's Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 85%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.18 million, down 4% year over year. We expect medical membership to suffer from declines in the company’s ACA-compliant individual and small group, and Medicaid products. The decrease should be partially offset by increases in its Commercial ASC, International Commercial Insured and Medicare Insured products.The company's focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.Share repurchases made by the company in the fourth quarter will help to lift its earnings.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

83,ANTM,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are scheduled to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Medical Sector TrendsThe medical sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S. healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicaid expansion under ACA. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, expansion into ancillary businesses, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position are expected to add to the top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. In addition, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were also a drag. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks — Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) — that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jan 30, before the market opens.Aetna is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer-directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement. On the other hand, HCA Healthcare, through its subsidiaries, provides health care services in the United States and England.Here are some companies from the medical sector that are likely to beat on earnings in the fourth quarter.Centene Corp.

Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteQ4 Expectations From HCA HealthcareThe company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals.  Continuing the trend, patient admissions are expected to grow further in the fourth quarter, driving the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (representing the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 497,000, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for in patient revenues per admission is pegged at $13,433, up 2.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the fourth quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.However, the company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to suffer from the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.Operating expenses per equivalent admission are also likely to increase in the fourth quarter with a rise in admissions.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.20% makes the prediction inconclusive.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

85,ANTM,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23.8%. Moreover, Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsSimilar to last quarter, MyriadGenetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance, led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. Per the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Also, during the last reported quarter, the company announced favorable data from a multi-center, double-blind and randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the GeneSight Psychotropic test on psychiatric treatment response in 1,200 patients with major depressive disorder. This is expected to stimulate expanded GeneSight adoption and payer coverage. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead.We also encouragingly note that, over the last few months, Myriad Genetics has been making encouraging progress with the EndoPredict test. During fiscal 2017, the company received reimbursement approval for EndoPredict in France, Quebec and an increased number of German sites. The company also received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) in August, within six months of the test launch in the United States.  Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients. Moreover, according to Myriad Genetics, EndoPredict presents a global market opportunity of more than $600 million annually, with major demand in countries like Canada and the United States.Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA and Prolaris revenues, all of which make up the chunk of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.The Prolaris testing’s volumes grew in double digits in the last reported quarter as well. We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test from Palmetto GBA, a MAC, in the first half of 2017. Moreover, management seems upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test as it represents a global market opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion annually.  Myriad Genetics witnessed continued year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer volumes, with pricing matching expectations in the last reported quarter. Per management, the company continued to witness a solid sample trend in this space. Last September, the company launched riskScore under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio. Notably, riskScore helps determine a woman's risk of developing breast cancer by combining genetic markers throughout the genome with the patient’s family and clinical history.Management believes that the company is well-positioned in breast cancer testing market for fiscal 2018, courtesy of encouraging Hereditary cancer volumes on steady growth and predictable long-term pricing. Thus, we believe the company is positioned to cash in on the huge potential in the breast cancer screening market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues of $189 million reflects a decline of 4.1% from the year-ago quarter reported number.On the flip side,unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some testsmay impact margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Myriad Genetics has an Earnings ESP of -3.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 23 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 24 cents.Zacks Rank: Myriad Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of -3.72% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 24 cents reflects a 7.7% decline from the year-ago quarter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

86,ANTM,"Given that repealing and replacing Obamacare was on the top of the Trump administration’s agenda, the healthcare sector exited 2017 quite creditably. Such gains are likely to continue with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) up 23% over the last one year, a shade higher than the S&P 500’s increase of 22.1%. Also, though the individual mandate for Obamacare has now been abolished, prospects for the sector continue to remain bright.The all too familiar factors of an ageing population and steady demand for healthcare services, irrespective of economic conditions, continue to make stocks from the sector a lucrative option. Further, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the fourth quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select healthcare stocks which are also slated to outperform their earnings estimates.2017’s “Repeal and Replace” ScareOne of President Trump’s clarion calls on the campaign trail, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was always going to be high on his agenda. Initially, in March, the Trump administration unveiled the American Healthcare Act, which proposed to ring in radical changes, such as eliminating the taxes mandated under Obamacare. At the same time, it sought to retain some of the existing law’s more popular provisions.While the House of Representatives voted to pass the Bill on May 4, albeit by a narrow margin, the draft legislation failed to garner the requisite support in the Senate. Faced with a serious legislative reversal, President Trump instead issued an executive order and took other steps, all of which sought to weaken, if not replace, Obamacare entirely.Ultimately, the Trump administration sought to achieve its primary objectives, tax cuts and a new healthcare legislation, through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new legislation effectively repeals the individual mandate, which is essential for the proper functioning of Obamacare.Healthcare’s Prospects Remain Undiminished And yet, after all of the current administration’s assaults, healthcare’s prospects remain as strong as ever. Data from Standard & Poor’s shows that up to September 30, 2017, healthcare had featured as the second best performing among the 10 major sectors for half of the last decade. Further, it had held on to third place for two more years. This implies that healthcare has been among the three top performing sectors for seven out of the last 10 years. This data alone is sufficient to guide investors into making investments in the healthcare sector.Further, we have the familiar factors of near undiminished demand, even during a downturn, and a rapidly aging population. There is no denying that healthcare isn’t among the leading prospects of sectors likely to ace fourth quarter earnings. Even so, total Q4 earnings for the sector are expected to be up 2.8% on 4.6% higher revenues.That’s far better than the more vaunted consumer discretionary and transportation sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 2.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the fourth quarter. Overall, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. (Read: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings)Our ChoicesHealthcare stocks have had a banner year, despite the continuous assault on Obamacare. However, the new administration’s approach to the healthcare industry in general has been more benign. For instance, little has been heard of the complaints about drug overpricing, an issue which both candidates touted steadily in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

88,ANTM,"The health insurers had a solid run last year thanks to increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position.  All these led to top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.  2018 Looks Promising Despite continued uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry is expected to continue performing well in 2018.  We see potential for sustained growth in expanding government programs. Increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions will keep the industry’s growth trend alive.A Top Ranked IndustryThe health insurance industry therefore looks attractive from an investment perspective. The Medical HMO carries a Zacks Industry Rank #24 (top 9% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Here we focus on two top health insurers, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report).Anthem is one of the largest publicly-traded managed care organizations in terms of membership with market capitalization of $58.33 billion. On the other hand, Aetna, with market capitalization of $58.24 billion, is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement.It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some top-ranked stocks in the industry are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks RankWhile Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Anthem has an edge with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).VGM ScoreBoth Aetna and Anthem have a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors. Both of the companies score equally on this ground.Price PerformanceBoth the companies have outperformed the industry in a year. While shares of Anthem have rallied 61.5%, Aetna stock has surged 50.6%. Here, Anthem performs better than Aetna.ValuationThe price-to-earnings (P/E) value metric is the best multiple used for valuing health insurers. Compared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 21.7, both Anthem and Aetna are undervalued. Yet, with a trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 18, Aetna is relatively cheaper than Anthem’s trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 19.2. This round clearly goes to Aetna.Moreover, the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio also remains biased toward Aetna. Aetna has a trailing 12-month PEG ratio of 1.60 while Anthem has the same of 1.69. However, both look overpriced when compared to the industry average of 1.50.  Dividend YieldBoth Anthem and Aetna have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholders’ value. They also maintain a record of raising dividends at regular intervals.Anthem has a current dividend yield of 1.17% and a five-year growth rate of 21.1%, while Aetna has a dividend yield of 1.09% and a five-year growth rate of 9.9%.Both the stocks’ dividend yield is higher than the industry’s average of 1.07%. Comparatively, Anthem has an edge over Aetna here.Leverage Ratio Both Anthem and Aetna have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 58.5. However, Anthem, with a leverage ratio of 59.4, has an edge over Aetna with the same of 64.2.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a comprehensive earnings history, both Anthem and Aetna delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While Anthem has an average earnings surprise of 11.5%, Aetna stands out with an average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Hence, Aetna scores over Anthem in this context.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsAnthem has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.02%, over the last 60 days. On the other hand, the same for Aetna has moved upward for 2018 by 1.1%, over the same time frame.For Anthem, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.21 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 10.4%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.7%.For Aetna, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $10.23 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.This round is slightly biased toward Aetna.ConclusionAnthem is poised better than Aetna when considering rank, price performance, leverage ratio and dividend yield.  However, Aetna wins on valuation, earnings surprise history and earnings estimate revisions & growth projections.Our comparative analysis shows that Anthem presently has an advantage over Aetna and is a better investment option.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

89,ANTM,"We believe UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) health services business named, Optum, will be a key driver for fourth-quarter earnings. Notably, Optum serves the global health care marketplace including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers.The company is investing in this segment with an aim to diversify earnings and seek protection from the highly regulated health services business, which has been significant for the company.  Its revenue CAGR of 21% from 2011 to 2017 (on the basis of expected revenues) is impressive. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from this segment would be $23.98 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 8.2%.Revenue growth from this segment is expected to be driven by increased contribution from each of its sub-segments namely OptumHealth, OptumInsight and Optum Rx.At OptumHealth, the top line should be aided by growth and market expansion in care delivery as well as increase in consumer health engagement products and services, behavioral health services and health financial services. Also, rise in number of consumers served and an improvement in average revenue per consumer will contribute to the segment’s revenues. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues of $5.4 billion represents 18.8% growth year over year.Meanwhile OptumInsight’s revenues will see accretion from growth in business process management services and data analytics. In fact, this segment has been witnessing an increase in revenue backlog, which reflects strong demand for its solutions. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.24 billion, up 7.9% year over year.OptumRx, the company’s pharmacy management arm, has achieved sufficient scale in the PBM business from the acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager — Catamaran — in 2015. Revenues in this segment have been increasing over the past many quarters owing to acquisitions and organic growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth from a surge in adjusted script grown. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $16.5 billion, up 4.1% year over year.UnitedHealth’s solid market share, growing Optum business, diversified premium revenue and disciplined capital management are also anticipated to aid overall earnings.

90,ANTM,"The Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years with its 285.2% appreciation, easily trumping the S&P 500’s 90.2%.  But the industry started pulling even further ahead in 2015 and again after the election of President Donald Trump. It is currently in the top 9% of Zacks industries.HMOs have been around for ages, but their prominence in recent years is related to rising medical costs with the consequent pressure on insurers’ profitability and the belief that timely checkups and preventive services can reduce expenditure. Moreover, HMOs generally consist of a network of physicians (general physicians, specialists, geriatricians, etc) and insurers, where covered individuals can get cheaper services by making copayments. Services from other medical professionals are generally not covered by the HMO.  President Obama’s Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) included mandates for individuals to buy insurance, provided for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and offered subsidies to individuals so they could do the needful. The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson (“GCHJ”) bill or the Graham-Cassidy bill seeks to strike down these aspects of the law, instead providing block grants to states, offering them the flexibility to frame their own healthcare laws while putting a ceiling on the amount of aid per person from the center and increasing it at a rate that is slower than health care inflation. Needless to say, the decision will be very hard to implement and the outcome, uncertain.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) put out a hurried preliminary report analyzing the change. Its main finding was that while the change would reduce the on-budget deficit between 2017 and 2026 by at least $133 billion, there would be a significant decline in insured individuals arising from the decline in Medicaid enrollment, decline in non-group coverage because of elimination of subsidies and decline in all kinds of health insurance because of the removal of penalties. These would be partially mitigated by state programs that would however be hard to frame and implement in the limited time.    The uninsured rate (people without insurance for the whole year) was 8.8% or 28.1 million in 2016 (as measured by the CPS ASEC, US Census Bureau), but if Obamacare is withdrawn, it’s expected that uninsured individuals would increase by 18 million through 2019 and 21 million through 2026. (Business Insider quoting Brookings Institution and Commonwealth Fund). Lower insured levels increase demand for affordable healthcare, which is positive for HMOs. Of course, many HMOs also cater to Medicaid and schemes mandated by the government, so they stand to benefit no matter which way the law goes.Demographics also remain favorable for the industry with an aging population (baby boomers), more in need of affordable, long term healthcare. Since both this segment and the impacted by injury/incapacitation are incapable of or have limited capability of earning money and therefore, paying insurance premiums, they primarily require managed healthcare, such as provided by an HMO. Tech Navio estimates that chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and arthritis that have become common across the globe will contribute to an 11% compounded annual growth rate in health insurance enrolments through 2020. This, along with low penetration rates across the world, especially in emerging markets create a good backdrop for HMO expansion.Technology is playing a bigger role in digitizing patient information and tools like smartphones and wearables are increasing involvement of millennial customers in their own healthcare. Moreover, millennials are thriftier than boomers, so lower-cost health management solutions are likely to be more attractive.The strong growth drivers have led to a 41.0% increase in HMO revenue over the past five years with a 35.6% increase in EBITDA and 34.1% increase in earnings before non-recurring items.Given the nature of the industry, regulatory pressures are likely to persist along with related compliance costs. The need for technology integration to cater to changing customer needs is likely adding to the cost pressure. But top line growth should continue, evening things out over time.5 Great Stocks For Your PortfolioHere are five Buy-rated stocks from the HMO segment that also have a VGM (value-growth-momentum) score of A, meaning that they are attractive picks for investors irrespective of their risk appetite or investment horizon.Magellan Health, Inc.

91,ANTM,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings are expected to benefit from increased number of individuals served across its government businesses.The company is an industry leader and has been growing its enrollment consistently from past several quarters owing to its huge market share in each of the business line it operates.Growth in Medical Membership: We expect medical membership growth in the to-be reported quarter to witness an increase in number of members served in its government business, partially offset by a decline in the international and commercial segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for medical membership is 49.3 million, up 1.4% year over year.This growth in medical membership will be driven by:Higher Enrollment in Public and Senior Markets: Government business, which primarily consists of Medicare and Medicaid, has been an area where UnitedHealth has invested tremendously in the recent years and intends to grow further. Currently, the government business is in huge demand. This is because of increasing baby boomer population, which has been a major contributor to membership growth.Notably, membership in this line of business has secularly risen over the past several quarters. The upside was owing to its relation with AARP and increasing number of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans with 4 stars and the same is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Government business is 15.4 million, up 11.7% year over year.Medicare Membership to Grow: Strong membership growth in  MA business must have been led by a combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance and improved service, and clinical performance and high retention rates in the fourth quarter. In fact, UnitedHealth’s distinctive product value and consumer experience have enabled it to increase market share in MA, which must have supported enrollment growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the MA business is 4.4 million, up 21.8% year over year.Higher Medicaid Enrollment: Also, Medicaid enrollment must have gained from the company’s expansion into newer states, contract renewals as well as growth in higher acuity, special needs membership. Increased adoption of states to move Medicaid to managed care should have led the company to gain Medicaid market share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Medicaid business is 6.6 million, up 11.7% year over year.Growth in enrollment will be partially offset by:Lower Customers in International Business: However, membership from the company’s international operations that is primarily concentrated in Brazil is expected to remain under pressure due to macro-economic contraction in the private healthcare market.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the International business is 4.1 million, down 3.3% year over year.Decline in Commercial Enrollment: Furthermore, medical membership growth is likely to be partially offset by a decline in Commercial enrollment, which will be under pressure due to exit from individual exchange markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Commercial business is 29.8 million, down 2.7% year over year.UnitedHealth’s solid market share, growing Optum business, diversified premium revenue and disciplined capital management are also anticipated to aid overall earnings.

92,ANTM,"We expect UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) results for the fourth quarter of 2107 to show broad-based growth across all segments of the enterprise. The company will reslease results on Jan 16, before the opening bell.Notably, UnitedHealth Care segment is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings, which should drive revenue growth.Factors Likely to Impact Fourth-Quarter Earnings:Higher Revenues from Medicare Business: UnitedHealth has been performing strongly in its government business, which includes Medicare and Medicaid. We expect a solid Medicare Advantage performance to continue in the fourth quarter, driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, improved service and a clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.Revenues in the Medicare & Retirement line of business are expected at $16.4 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thereby reflecting year-over-year growth of 17%.Higher Enrollment in Public and Senior Segment: The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the fourth quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the fourth quarter on higher membership in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans. Enrollment in the company’s Public and Senior segment is likely to be 15.4 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, up 11.7% year over year.Revenue Growth from Optum: Results should also show a rise in revenues from its health services’ segment, Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments namely, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from the segment should be nearly $24 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Disciplined Share Buyback: The bottom line should further get a cushion from the shares repurchased in the fourth quarter.However, earnings will be partially offset by lesser people, served through individual products as the company withdrew itself from most of the individual public exchange markets.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4.4%.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UnitedHealth has an Earning ESP of -0.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

93,ANTM,"The year 2017 witnessed a lot of regulatory noise surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Also, health insurers scaled back their participation due to continued loss on public exchanges. Rising consolidation was another major issue.The ACA had brought more Americans under health insurance plans. It largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, consequently adding to medical enrollment.However, everyone was focused on President Trump’s decision to abolish the act. Although the ACA is still not repealed, Trump signed the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" into law on Dec 22, which would make significant changes to the law.The tax act ends the “individual mandate” — a major component of ACA — that requires individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty fee. In the absence of the individual mandate, healthy people are likely to opt out of medical insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would increase the count of uninsured Americans by 13 million and push premiums up by an average of around 10% from 2018 to 2027.Despite facing stringent regulations, health insurers have shown impressive operating performance in 2017, with most of the top players clocking solid top line, bottom line and membership growth. Companies like WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) have kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, indicating their rising operational excellence.Increasing consolidation in the health insurance industry has led to a reduction in the number of players. Although the effect of market concentration might not have been good for consumers due to higher medical cost, it has helped the players enhance the scale of their operations and gain market share.In 2017, although two big merger deals — Anthem with Cigna and Humana with Aetna — have been blocked by the U.S. Department of Justice, mergers and acquisitions activities continued to be rife.The recent merger deal between two of the industry stalwarts — Aetna and CVS Health — is worth a mention here. The deal, if finalized, would join two branches of the industry, in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management.However, public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been much profitable for the insurers. They failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individuals, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. Health insurers like Humana, Aetna, UnitedHealth and Anthem have already started scaling back their participation from these exchanges after incurring mounting losses.Increasing operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins. The insurers, however, are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).Despite the challenges, the industry has gained nearly 40.6% for 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 20%. The HMO industry is among the top 4% of the Zacks Ranked industries.Stocks in FocusWe zeroed in on three stocks that have outperformed in 2017 and have also seen upward estimate revision in the last 60 days.Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), a leading health maintenance organization, has rallied 41.3% in 2017. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 5.2% in the past 60 days. It has a Growth Score of A. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene, a multi-national healthcare company of the United States, has gained 78.5% in 2017. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 4% in the past 60 days. It has a Growth Score of B. The stock also sports a Zacks Rank #1.The Joint Corporation (JYNT  -  Free Report), another leading managed care company, has gained 87.2% in 2017. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward to 6 cents from break-even expected 60 days back. Joint It has a Growth Score of A. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

94,ANTM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the consolidation is expected to be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings in 2018.Benefits for AnthemHealthSun is a perfect fit for Anthem given its rapidly-expanding Medicare Advantage (MA) business with vast presence in Florida, the state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from HealthSun’s superior health care services through an effective network of primary care clinics, pharmacy support and transportation services plus a narrow network of physician specialists and integrated medical cost management.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The integration will allow the company to serve more than 650,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has surged 59% outperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Given its progress on fundamentals, the recently inked buyout deal should keep alive the momentum in the stock going forward.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the Government sponsored health insurance for retirees, which provides extra benefits and services to senior citizens, has been in huge demand of late from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of small and big acquisitions have been witnessed by the industry with the involved parties scrambling to grow this line of business. Some notable takeovers are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The unsuccessful mergers of recent times namely Anthem Inc.’s with Cigna Corp. and Aetna’s with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThe above-mentioned deal comes as no surprise to us, given the company’s desire to flourish in the lucrative MA business. This deal will boost the company to progress in the business line, especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which could have elevated it as a leading player in the MA market.  The company is also on track to acquire America’s 1st Choice, a privately held Medicare Advantage organization for profit offering HMO products including Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to fruitful use and is readily open for attractive acquisitions and we expect to hear more from its end on these lines.Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

95,ANTM,"The year 2017 has failed to turn things around for CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has underperformed the S&P 500 market year to date. The stock has lost 5.4% as against the S&P 500 market’s 20.4% gain.During the first-quarter 2017 earnings call, CVS Health’s President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said, “We continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year, but our goals remain clear, and we fully intend to return to healthy levels of growth.” Unfortunately, little of this could materialize. The company is still grappling with issues from the past along with other challenges.2016 Deals Major BlowsCVS Health is still trying to recover from the setback caused by Prime Therapeutics’ collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) in August 2016. Owing to this, CVS Health lost access to Prime’s 22 million members. Notably, Prime Therapeutics is the fourth largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the United States owned by 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.Another major blow was dealt at the end of 2016 when the TRICARE retail pharmacy network managed by Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) restricted CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, from participating. This network, with more than 57,000 locations, included Walgreens Boots as a member instead.Thanks to these developments, CVS Health’s shares lost 15.2% in the last five months of 2016.   2017 Hasn’t Been Kind as WellCVS Health’s Retail/Long Term Care (LTC) business has been sluggish since first-quarter 2017 largely due to declining same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and a rise in the generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed).The company’s Retail/LTC business was also majorly impacted by weak operations in hurricane-ravaged areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. The company has valued the hurricane impact at about $55 million — primarily costs to cover insurance deductibles.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market has aggravated matters for CVS Health. To counter competition, CVS Health will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.CVS Health ~ A Force to Reckon With“If there is no struggle, there is no progress”Nothing could be more apt than this remark by Frederick Douglass. CVS Health, with a massive market cap of $74.52 billion, has been leaving no stones unturned to bounce back.Mergers & Acquisitions to Strengthen PBM BusinessIn a historic decision, CVS Health decided to acquire the United States’ third-largest health insurance company Aetna (AET) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies from the deal, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction.Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business.Apart from the Aetna deal, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS Health’s PBM customers.Initiatives to Boost Retail/LTC BusinessThe company has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. Subsequently, the company is planning to collaborate with PBMs and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Recognizing the growing opportunities in the digital market, CVS Health has also been focused on enhancing its online and mobile capabilities in 2017. Building on the strength of its digital tools within pharmacy, with 60% of patients using them, the company is focused on offering advanced services to customers. These services range from Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality and ExtraCare. Moreover, CVS Health has been enthusiastically working with Instacart and is now delivering from 2,800 stores.Is There a Rebound in the Cards?CVS Health has been firing on all cylinders of late. The company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) to provide services including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.While such measures will help smoothen the bumpy ride for the company, 2018 might come with a fresh set of surprises and challenges.

In fact, the company’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 16% over the last 11 years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare contributed significantly to the company’s top line. However, the Trump administration is making every effort to repeal and replace the ACA. Despite the unpredictable nature of regulations and its impact on the industry, Humana continues to be an attractive pick for investors.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance.

It has been witnessing significant decline in enrollment in this business. Along with other health insurers like Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business in 2018.

97,ANTM,"President Donald Trump’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare have created quite an uproar among health insurers.

Their strong capital position also reflects profitable operations.Business diversifying strategies with primary focus on ancillary services and products have also boosted the revenue base.Q4 TrendsContinuously rising demand for government plans, especially Medicare and Medicaid, continues to favor health insurers. Hence, revenues of the companies offering these plans are likely to witness a consistent improvement in their government businesses.Moreover, an aging U.S. population that has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage is likely to prove favorable.ObamaCare has significantly benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, boosting medical enrollment and aiding bad debt management. This trend is likely to drive the fourth-quarter results as well.A diversified product portfolio along with proposed mergers and consolidations are also likely to accelerate growth for health insurers in terms of global expansion as well as strengthening of foothold in existing markets.However, the companies have been facing higher losses on public exchanges that have compelled them to scale back operations or plan an exit from the business.Moreover, health insurers have been seeing escalating operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology along with fees and taxes that continue to hurt profits.

98,ANTM,"Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) is well poised for long-term growth on the back of its membership base that has strengthened due to strategic acquisitions, growing national accounts in the commercial segment and the Medicaid expansion in the government segment. Apart from this, Anthem’s revenues have also been driven by net investment income that started increasing since 2016 due to the interest rate hikes.Anthem’s capital management, backed by solid cash position, also impresses.  The company has been witnessing a consistent rise in its cash flow from operations.

99,ANTM,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) recently received rating action on its senior unsecured notes from A.M Best. The rating giant has assigned Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings of “bbb+” to Anthem’s $900 million 2.5% notes due 2020, $750 million 2.95% notes due 2022, $850 million 3.35% notes due 2024, $1.6 billion 3.65% notes due 2027 and $1.4 billion 4.375% notes due 2047. The outlook for these Credit Ratings has remained stable.The rating giant believes that Anthem will use the proceeds from this offering for the tender offer announced on Nov 14, 2017, to pay its debt obligations that includes a debt maturity in January 2018. The proceeds will also be used to finance the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.According to A.M. Best, these notes issuances are likely to increase Anthem’s financial leverage to 45% or below compared with the present level of 38%. The rating giant expects the level to moderate with time. However, the issue regarding the terminated merger between Anthem and Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report) that involved a break-up fee of $1.85 billion is still not resolved. The leverage estimates do not include the possibility of the payment of this break-up fee.In a year’s time, its shares have gained 57.7%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 40.5%Anthem has been continuously delivering solid operating earnings on the back of revenue growth. Sufficient generation of cash flows has provided it with strong liquidity as well. Its profitability has been mainly driven by its Commercial business, partially offset by a lower margin in its government business and challenges faced in Individual business.Moreover, the upcoming acquisitions of HealthSun and America’s 1st Choice are likely to add nearly 170,000 Medicare Advantage members to Anthem’s existing Simply Healthcare Medicare Advantage and Amerigroup Managed Medicaid membership.

Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 82.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 11.8% improved 70 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.05 billion, up 2% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business resulting from increased membership.Benefit ratio of 84.3% deteriorated 70 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.

However, the figure compares unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.This underperformance primarily stemmed from $55 million decline in California Provider Fee revenues, an estimated $30 million of lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

103,ANTM,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.The company has a decent surprise history. It pulled off positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.84% on the back of strong performance by its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by its Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion that reflects a slight decrease of 1% year over year.The company’s consistent growth in premium revenues has been largely driven by Medical membership growth. Humana has seen solid medical membership increase in its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage businesses. For the quarter, Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 14 million, up 48% year over year.Other FactorsThe standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to have grown, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses that keep putting pressure on margins.Individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016. Along with other companies like Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana has also started scaling down this business and plans to exit it in 2018. This segment is expected to affect the company’s results in the third quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Humana has an Earnings ESP of -1.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.32 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.27. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc. QuoteZacks Rank:Humana currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Despite having a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative Earnings ESP makes the prediction inconclusive.

The upside reflects continued strong performance in the company’s Health Care segment as well as lower transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 compared to 2016.Operational UpdateHowever, operating revenues of $14.9 billion not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.1 billion by approximately 1% but also declined 5% year over year. The downside stemmed from lower premiums in Health Care segment that includes lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee (HIF) in 2017.Adjusted expense ratioimproved 10 basis points (bps) to 17.5% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the temporary suspension of the HIF and Aetna's expense management initiatives. This was largely offset by targeted investment spending on the company’s growth initiatives.Total company expense ratioimproved 50 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17.4%, primarily due to lower transaction and integration-related costs.Third-quarter after-tax net income margin was 5.6 %, up 180 bps year over year.  The adjusted pre-tax marginwas 9.2%, up 70 bps from the prior-year quarter.

This was, however, partially offset by a deterioration in the Government MBR.Group InsuranceTotal revenues of $650 million increased 4.7% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenuesof $631 million grew 2.4% year over year driven by higher premiums in Aetna's life and disability products.Pre-tax adjusted earningswere $34 million, up 54% from the third-quarter 2016 due to higher underwriting margins in disability products, partially offset by lower underwriting margins in life products.Large Case PensionsTotal revenues came at $80 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2016.

Further, adjusted earnings jumped from $1.74 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $24.68 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.61 billion and were also lower than $25.41 billion in the year-ago period.Q3 HighlightsAdjusted gross profit in the third quarter was flat year over year at $2.24 billion. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $759.3 million, down 13.5% from the prior-year quarter. Total adjusted claims amounted to 343.6 million in the third quarter, flat year over year.The St. Louis, MO-based pharmacy benefit manager's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) witnessed a 1% rise to $1,947.4 million in the third quarter. The upside was driven by operational cost improvement backed by focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty services.Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteBalance SheetThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.40 billion compared with $3.08 billion at the end of 2016. Total debt, at the end of the quarter, was $13.73 billion versus $14.85 billion at the end of 2016. In fact, the company is striving to reduce its debt levels.Guidance RaisedExpress Scripts increased guidance for full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to a range of $6.97 to $7.05, from a range of $6.95 to $7.05. This represents an increase of 10% over adjusted earnings per share results at the mid-point of the range in 2016.For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.03 to $2.11, which represents growth of 8% to 12% over the fourth quarter of 2016. The company expects total adjusted claims for the fourth quarter in the range of 347 million to 363 million.Express Scripts Likely to Lose AnthemExpress Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement.Our TakeWe are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Further, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden which is paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include EnteroMedics Inc  and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A combination of organic and inorganic growth measures are likely to drive revenues in this segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is $1.6 billion, up 5.8% year over year.The company is expanding in underpenetrated regions such as Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, which are perceived as high growth areas.

These include Marsh’s build out of MMA and its UK SME strategy, the emergence of cyber, flood and mortgage practices at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, investments at Mercer in Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange, investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform, and continued pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and the public sector.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Marsh & McLennan does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients, of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.53%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Anthem is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ANTM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.45 per share for ANTM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 per share.

117,ANTM,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anthem has been witnessing revenue appreciation over the past many quarters, backed by membership growth. Both its fully insured and self-funded memberships have grown consistently. The third quarter is also expected to witness the same uptrend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenue is currently pegged at $22.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 5%. Our consensus estimates for fully insured and self-funded memberships stand at 15.3 million and 25 million, up 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively.Total medical enrollment has also been steadily rising on the back of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical enrollment is pegged at 40.3 million, up 1% year over year. The Government business of Anthem has been a major contributor behind this increase in Medical enrollment. Our consensus estimate for total operating revenue of Government business is $11.8 billion, up 3% year over year.Operating revenues of its Commercial business have also been impressive over the years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total operating revenue from Commercial business is $10.1 billion, up 5% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedicare Advantage product offerings might have supported Medicare enrollment growth, again boosting the company’s top line.However, Anthem expects to witness higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products as was the case last quarter.In addition, the company is likely to have experienced higher benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business due to higher claims.Administrative costs are likely to have risen during the third quarter continuing the previous trend.The Individual business is also expected to remain a drag in the third quarter.Earnings PredictionsOur proven model shows that Anthem has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP:Anthem has an Earnings ESP of +1.55%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.45 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41. The positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise.

118,ANTM,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 18, 52 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Trends, third-quarter 2017 results of the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported results, account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% year over year on 6.9% rise in revenues, with 73.1% beating earnings per share estimates.As of Oct 18, 5.4% of the total Medical sector, one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group, reported third-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 66.7% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicare expansion under Obamacare. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.We expect the third-quarter earnings for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment, which is one of the major revenue components. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23.226 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network is pegged at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues is $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Per the company’s guidance for the third quarter, its total adjusted claims are expected in the range of $340-$350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88-$1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is +0.13%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteWe expect Centene Corporation’s (CNC  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings to be aided by solid Medicaid expansion.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year-over-year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion one of the provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report) and many more are exiting it.The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Centene also has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to strengthen the possibility for a beat. Notably, the Earnings ESP for Centene is +2.45%.Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

119,ANTM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has expanded the health plan choices for Medicare beneficiaries in six New Hampshire counties. The expansion involves multiple new Humana Medicare Advantage (MA) plan offerings during the 2018 MA and Prescription Drug Plan Annual Enrollment Period (AEP).The new Humana MA PPO plans would offer the members affordable alternatives to original Medicare or original Medicare paired with a Medicare Supplement plan.

(ANTM  -  Free Report), WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) and others have been engaged in mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships to strengthen their presence in the Medicare market.Humana has always remained focused on revenue and margin growth of its Medicare business.

123,ANTM,"President Trump has come up with an executive order to dismantle the health care reform act following the failure of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which was a last ditch effort in achieving the objective.What Does the Executive Order Say?One of the most disturbing proposals is putting an end to cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments that help low-income Americans pay for health insurance. Health insurers and hospitals have long pleaded the President to maintain the subsidies so that health insurers can function on the exchanges. Without these subsidies it would be uneconomical for insurers to sell policies on exchanges.Other than CSR, the plan also proposes loosening standards with respect to pre-existing conditions.Insurers UnsureCutting of cost-sharing subsidies that were directly paid to health insurers has prompted players to take another look at their participation on public exchanges. Already a number of players like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) have exited these exchanges after suffering huge losses.Meanwhile, shares of some of the players having substantial presence on public exchanges such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) lost 3.3% and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) was down 3.4% in the trading session following the announcement.Hospitals Too Sick to Suffer More?Trump’s executive order has sent jitters across the hospital sector that has been weighed down by a weak business environment. Players overall are suffering from weak business volumes in the form of low patient admissions and fewer patient visits. Also, an increase in uncompensated care and charity care have eaten into their bottom line.The same is evident from comments by one of the leading industry players, HCA Healthcare Inc. which during second-quarter earnings, said that its uncompensated care including bad debt and charity care are rising faster this year than in the last. It is seeing roughly 4% to 5% growth in uninsured admissions, “which is a little higher than the last half of 2016 and first quarter.”Another large for-profit hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare said uncompensated care costs that dropped from 2015 to 2016 are now on the rise. In its hospitals, volumes have been softer than anticipated and an increase in uninsured revenues has resulted in upward pressure on uncompensated care expense.Players are all the more jittery since axing of cost-sharing reductions would directly lead to a rise in uninsured patients, translating into unpaid hospital bills.Industry’s PerformanceDespite the uncertainty, the industry has performed strongly as evident by a rise of 80.6% in a year’s time compared with a gain of 20.8% for the S&P 500.What Lies NextTurbulences like this have been common in the health care space for the past one year or so from the time efforts are being made to pull back Obamacare.

126,ANTM,"Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) has appointed Joseph M. Zubretsky as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective Nov 6, 2017.Zubretsky has to his credit a career spanning 35 years in the insurance and financial services industry. Most recently, he served as president and CEO of The Hanover Insurance Group and was a member of its board.Until recently, Molina Healthcare was run by the two sons of its founders — J. Mario Molina and John Molina. Both were, however, ousted following the company’s poor performance.The appointment of the new CEO is one of the steps taken in the massive restructuring exercise undertaken by management to take the company back to profitability.In the second quarter, the company’s 2017 earnings guidance was withdrawn due to uncertainty regarding cost sharing reductions, cost trend in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico, health plans and variability around timing of benefits and costs related to the restructuring plan.Molina Healthcare’s share price has returned 9.1% since the removal of the Molina brothers compared with the growth of 11.5% by the industry it belongs to.Other restructuring and profitability improvement steps include reduction in corporate and health plans workforce by 10%, termination of public exchange participation in Utah and Wisconsin with additional states in review, and restructuring of Direct delivery operations.These measures are aimed at generating $300-$400 million in savings upon completion of restructuring in late 2018. The company expects nearly $200 million in savings related to staff reductions to fully contribute to 2018 earnings. The company expects an additional $130-$150 million restructuring cost in the second half of 2017.  Zubretsky, with his valuable experience is deemed as the perfect fit to lead the company successfully during this transformative period. He boasts a track of strong leadership across multiple businesses, both inside and outside managed care. He also successfully restructured other organizations earlier.The transformation of the entire enterprise into a leaner, more streamlined organization, will enhance decision-making, improve the company’s operating performance, and aid its margins. Though the seeds of reformation have been planted, these will take time to bear fruit.Molina Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Anthem Inc.

127,ANTM,"Healthcare, particularly Obamacare, had been at the receiving end of President Trump, even before he assumed office. The Republicans’ repeal and replace efforts have, however, failed, with the American Health Care Act (AHCA) not getting enough support in the House, thanks to a solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers.Failure of Last-Ditch EffortsThe most recent effort, in the form of the Graham-Cassidy bill, also failed to get any success, due to numerous suggestions having been not well received by the industry participants. Among the most unpopular of them were putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, loosening provisions with regard to pre-existing conditions, elimination of Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, plus ending cost-sharing subsidies by 2020.Also, CBO (Congressional Budget Office) analysis of the proposal fund that millions of Americans would lose health coverage due to $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid through 2026, and that the bill would have resulted in loss of health insurance coverage, has destabilized insurance markets and decreased access to affordable coverage and care for commoners.A Short-Lived Relief?Though the failure of final attempts to undo Obamacare brought a sigh of relief to the industry, it should only be temporary, given the recent comments made by Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker, who stressed efforts to continue with the fight to remove Obamacare.How to Play the Sector?Amid this conundrum, investors primarily want to invest in stocks with a robust business model to protect and shield from market swings. Many good players from the space have remodeled their business mix, diversified into new product classes, new territories and added new functionalities to provide them with an armor against market vagaries.Insurers’ share price performance and steadily growing business profits stand as a testament to their ability to successfully sail through these high tides, created by these ill-fated reform proposals ever since.  Though the repeal-and-replace efforts have been creating noise causing investors to shy away from the sector, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to some stocks in this space, which offer solid businesses to serve up handsome returns over time.These stocks sporting a favorable Zacks Rank are indicative of witnessing positive estimate revisions over time, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation.They also pride over a positive earnings surprise history and have outperformed the industry’s increase of 44% in the past year. Additionally, they sport a Value Style Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), effectively outperform other stocks.Some of our preferred choices are:Anthem Inc.

128,ANTM,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc.(WCG  -  Free Report) continues to maintain a leading position in the industry on the back of its growth strategies. The company’s revenues have been consistently rising over the last 10 years.The ObamaCare Act (ACA) implemented by the former U.S. President Barrack Obama contributed significantly to the company’s top-line growth. However, there remains uncertainty around “Repealing and Replacing” the ACA under the Trump administration. The Medicaid funding change is on gun point of the lawmakers which if materialises might hurt the company.Despite the regulatory uncertainty prevailing in the industry, WellCare Health remains an attractive pick for investors.Apart from the contribution of the ACA, the company’s revenues have also been supported by strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances since 2011.

The company has seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.However, it suffers from rising level of debt that increases the borrowing cost, eventually draining the bottom line.Also, the company has been witnessing a steep increase in the total expenses that are weighing on the margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider stocks like Humana Inc.

131,ANTM,"There are many different ways to make money in the stock market. One proven way to earn great returns, which many investors use, is to invest in stocks within the best performing industries.Studies have shown that tapping into an average stock in a strong industry can be a better option than picking an outstanding stock in a relatively poor-performing industry. This is not to say that any stock chosen at random in a great industry will make money, but by picking a strong industry, you certainly improve your odds.This is where choosing a stock with a strong Zacks Rank, which also falls within an industry that sports a top Zacks Industry Rank, can prove successful. Zacks classifies stocks into 265 different industries. The Zacks Industry Rank is calculated by taking the average Zacks Rank for every stock in that industry category every day.Now, let’s look at three great stocks that also fall within highly ranked industries:1.       H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)H&E rents and sells products for an array of industries, ranging from earthmoving and concrete equipment to cranes and generators. H&E is coming off a solid second quarter that saw its revenues jump by 3.0% to $249.4 million and its net income pop from $7.5 million to $9.9 million.This Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and scored an “A” grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. H&E is part of the “Manufacturing – Construction and Mining” industry, which currently ranks #4 overall out of the 265 industries tracked by Zacks.The company’s P/S ratio of 1 matches the industry average, while its EV/EBITDA of 5.21 outpaces the industry’s 9.99. The stock has gained 16.86% year-to-date, which tops the S&P 500’s 10.18%.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company’s earnings are expected to pop 21.21% this quarter, and its sales are set to jump 4.91% for the current quarter and 6.04% next quarter. Within the last 60 days, H&E has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current quarter, next quarter, current year, and following year periods.2.       Anthem, Inc.

Anthem offers a wide range of medical and specialty products and owns Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance.Anthem is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company’s standing in the “Medical – HMO’s” industry places Anthem in the top 4% of industries at #11 overall.Anthem’s shares are currently trading at 15.48x earnings, which represents a discount to the market as a whole—and compared to the industry’s average. The company’s P/B ratio of 1.82 also marks a discount to the industry and some of its biggest competitors, including Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Also, its 45.11% gain over the past year crushes the S&P 500 average and tops the industry’s 32.24% gain.Based on our current consensus estimates, Anthem’s sales are projected to grow 4.74% this quarter and 5.66% for the year.

The Tempe, Arizona-based company’s projected full-year EPS growth of 125% crushes the industry average of 38.69% and blows away semiconductor giant Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) projected 40.13% growth.Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s sales are projected to climb 9.17% in the current quarter and 29.83% for the year. Amtech’s 170.82% year-to-date price change thoroughly outpaces the industry average of 51.40% and crushes the S&P 500 average of 10.18%, meaning that it has been one of the hottest stocks in this strong industry.Amtech is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth and an “A” for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Anthem has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Anthem’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Anthem has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 15.4, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Anthem has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Anthem currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ANTM a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 12.5, which is slightly better than the industry average of 13.7. Clearly, ANTM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives ANTM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the consensus estimate for the current quarter has dipped 0.4% in the past two months, the full year estimate has inched up 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Anthem, Inc. Price and Consensus  Anthem, Inc. Price and Consensus | Anthem, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a formidable industry rank (top 5% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

134,ANTM,"Global consulting giant, Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report), yesterday announced its plan of opening an innovation center in Midtown, Atlanta, next year, and creating 800 tech jobs by 2020. As described by Accenture, an innovation hub is a place where its clients “can work side-by-side” with the company’s professionals “to ideate, rapidly prototype and launch solutions”, in order to meet the requirements of the fast-changing digital world.The center, which will be located at Technology Square’s Centergy building, is likely to open its doors next summer. Accenture already occupies 33,000 square feet of area in this building and with this new development, it will add another 44,000 square feet, making it the largest tenant. Accenture operate several offices and currently employs about 2,800 professionals in the city.Atlanta has emerged as the best destination for business communities, particularly the tech companies, in the last five-six years due to the availability of relatively less expensive and talented workforce. Apart from Accenture, some other Fortune 500 companies which have offices in Atlanta include General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With the opening of the innovation center, the company will be able to help clients create, manage, integrate and analyze value-focused solutions, thereby giving them “tangible results faster than ever.” Furthermore, the company noted that it intends to create more than 800 jobs over the next three years, across its “Strategy, Consulting, Digital, Technology and Operations” businesses.The recent move is part of its planned strategy of making $1.4-billion technology and training investment in the United States. Under the planned investment strategy, the company will open 10 innovation hubs and create 15,000 new jobs in the country by 2020. The recently announced innovation center will be Accenture’s second facility under the investment strategy, while the company already opened the first center this February in Houston.The Accenture stock has returned 17.9% year to date, outperforming 15.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Going ahead, the company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

135,ANTM,"Public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been too successful in serving the insurers. This is evident from losses incurred by most of the health insurers participating in these exchanges.Affordability-Risk Pool Trade OffThe exchanges saw a deluge of very sick patients buying insurance cover online, thanks to the subsidies provided to the enrollees. They, however, failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individual, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. This led to increase in claims on business conducted on these exchanges.Let us discuss how the big four insurers have been affected by this public exchange business.Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s largest health insurance companies, recently announced that it would pull back its participation from public exchanges, expecting a loss of $200 million in 2017. Aetna incurred pre-tax operating losses of $450 in 2016.Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is another big insurer offering plans on Affordable Care Act (ACA). Anthem suffered a decline in enrollment in 2016 and the same continued in the first-half 2017.This prompted the company to scale back its participation in this loss-making business for 2018. It pulled out of exchange plans in 11 states for 2017.Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market as well as a smooth transition for consumers, uncertainty remains.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) lost more than $1 billion on the exchanges in 2015 and 2016. After two years of losing money from plans sold on the ACA insurance exchanges, it exited nearly all of the exchanges for 2017. UnitedHealth presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has already declared that it will exit its Individual Commercial business in 2018. After incurring mounting losses in this business in 2015 and 2016, Humana pulled back its participation from 11 states in 2016. The insurer anticipates incurring a modest $45 million loss on ACA exchange plans in 2017, excluding the effect of which, it estimates the earnings per share for 2017 to be at least $11.50. The company also carries Zacks Rank #3.Continued UncertaintyThe health insurers that have been making significant losses on ACA exchange plans are uncertain about thefinal verdict from the Trump administration. This is because the administration has been vocal about removing cost reduction subsides that help insurance companies pay claims of patients buying coverage on public exchanges.These players have been lobbying to keep these subsidies intact, which would otherwise lead to the health plan enrollees facing cost increases of 20-25% for 2018 coverage.The U.S. Senate is working on a bipartisan approach for shoring up the ACA’s public exchanges by funding cost-sharing subsidies for low income patients.The uncertainty on the CSR funding puts a question mark on the sustainability of these  exchanges. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, it will not be surprising to see an exodus of insurance companies from these exchanges.  This exit will lead to more Americans finding themselves with fewer healthcare options, causing an increase in uninsured rates, defeating the central tenet of the Health Care Reform Act.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

136,ANTM,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) continue to hit new lows amid mounting scrutiny pressure from lawmakers, investigating agencies and regulators over the credit reporting company’s response to the data breach. The stock tumbled again yesterday due to a series of events which occurred during the entire day.Recent Additions in TroubleIntensifying troubles for Equifax, a group of 37 U.S. Senators, yesterday, vowed for investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice. They argued that there is possibly a higher chance of a potential insider trading, as three Equifax’s executives had sold shares in three days after the company discovered the data breach.Meanwhile, the state of Massachusetts announced yesterday that it is planning to file a lawsuit against the company on behalf of its residents. If the state goes ahead with its plan, then it will be no surprise if other states follow suit.Furthermore, a U.S. house panel is probing the data breach and announced that it would testify Equifax’s chief executive — Richard Smith — on Oct 3.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 15% yesterday after the aforementioned news surfaced. It should be noted that the stock has lost over 30% of its value from last Thursday’s closing price. In the year-to-date period, Equifax has lost 16.3%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 27.3%.What’s Bothering Investors?On Sep 7, Equifax announced that highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been impacted due to this cyber attack.Per the company, the data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Apart from some sensitive personal information, hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.The recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Bottom LineThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe that investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retaining its current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

137,ANTM,"The Healthcare sector has been in the limelight since the election of President Donald Trump, a vehement opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His proposed changes (some of which go against the interest of the insurers), via the proposal to repeal and replace, raised concerns across the space.Repeal and replace, however, has been left hanging in midair due to lack of sufficient government support. Therefore, continued regulatory uncertainty persists in the sector.Industry TrendsThe health insurance industry, meanwhile, continues to grow profitably as evident from the rise in its top line, as by most companies in the recently reported quarter. Many companies like Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) raised their outlook for 2017. This is indicative of significant growth opportunities in the industry.Players in the industry are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues of the companies dealing with these plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana have been witnessing consistent upticks on the back of government business.Thanks to the ACA, the industry has been benefiting from a reduction in the uninsured population that aided in medical enrollment as well as helped companies lower bad debts.Rapidly increasing business diversification, focus on ancillary services and products contributing significantly to the insurers’ revenues help the companies combat the effects of stringent regulations.Also, as the median age of the U.S. population grows, overall demand for medical coverage continues to rise.Nevertheless, health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges as these businesses have resulted in significant losses for most of the players.Increasing operating cost related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins.Although the U.S Senate has rejected the appeal of President Trump to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform, an uncertainty has risen regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to result in higher uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.The Congressional Budget Office’s estimation also states that reduction in government spending will lead to a loss of insurance for 23 million people over the next 10 years.Industry Rank & Price PerformanceDespite the challenges, the health insurance industry is currently ranked #20, which represents the top 8% of the Zacks Industry Rank.It has also been able to perform well as evident from its rally of 47.8% in the last one year compared with 16.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.Stocks Worth ConsideringWe bring to you three health insurance stocks that have a solid Value Score, a favorable Zacks Rank and has delivered average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Aetnais a provider of healthcare, dental, pharmacy, group life, disability, and long-term care benefits.

138,ANTM,"The brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been affected due to this cyber attack.The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Per Equifax, criminals stole consumer data like “names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers.”In addition to this, as per Equifax’s investigation, hackers accessed the credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14% last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced. Notably, the stock has significantly underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Equifax has lost 4.2% of its value during this period, while the industry recorded growth of 26.2%.Nonetheless, the financial information services provider further noted that its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases seemed to be safe as it did not find any unauthorized activity. This implies that the consumers’ credit scores are safe.Among the Worst Data BreachesThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times as well as bigger than those at the aforementioned companies. The latest data breach at Equifax is expected to have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even make tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for a long time.Criticism MountingThe recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach.Various investigation agencies, including attorney generals of New York and Illinois, and the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, have already started probing whether the company met its risk management responsibilities or not. Equifax’s directors may be charged for negligence if the investigating agencies discover any loopholes in risk management.Also, per Reuters, two lawsuits have been filed against the company’s negligence over consumer data protection, one at Portland, OR, and one in Atlanta.Bottom LineWith the company facing huge criticism from customers, and lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon. We opine that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.The recent cyber attack proved that most organizations across the globe still lack proper cybersecurity measures. With cyber security becoming a matter of utmost importance, companies should regard it as part of safeguarding strategies and look for more stringent cybersecurity measures to plug the loopholes in the system.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

139,ANTM,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is on a stellar run. Continued strong growth in membership, superior performance of business units along with solid capital position, and an upbeat outlook with strong fundamentals have propelled the stock.The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 38% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 1.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Cigna with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) looks all the more impressive at a time when the healthcare sector is grappling with stringent regulations and remains under considerable regulatory uncertainty. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The returns compare favorably with gains of 23.5%, 31%, 34% for UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively.  So what led the momentum in the stock?    The stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its Global Supplement business has been  growing for the past many years, a trend which continued through the first half of 2017. For 2017, the company expects adjusted income from operations of $310 million to $330 million (up from the previous guidance of $295 million to $315 million), which translates into a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 9% (calculated at the midpoint).We expect the segment to grow on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.Also, its Seniors market — Medicare Advantage (MA), MA Part D, and Medicaid businesses — is poised for strong growth. Cigna forayed into the Medicare Advantage market (where it was virtually nonexistent) by acquiring HealthSpring Inc. We expect high single-digit revenue growth from this line of business in the long term.Membership growth, which has been steady for quarters now, has been seen this year too. We expect a rise in membership going forward, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow from 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth experienced by the company across its Commercial market segments.Its strong capital position is impressive. The company’s cash flow from operations has been increasing consistently for the last three years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017. Its disciplined capital management strategy involves investments in its business portfolio, strategic mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases.Above all, the recent guidance raise by the company cements our confidence in the stock. Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to grow 19% to 23% (versus the previous outlook of 12% to 18%). Revenue guidance of $41.1 billion translates into a year-over-year increase of 3.5%. Cigna’s earnings per share projection of $9.75 to $10.05 (versus the previous outlook of $9.35-$9.85) hints at growth of 37.7% over 2016 (calculated at the midpoint of the guidance).Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Cigna to continue in the coming quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

140,ANTM,"Universal Health Services, Inc.'s (UHS  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of its solid inorganic strategy. This has been contributing to the company’s growth story since long. The acquisition of the adult services division of Cambian Group in 2016 is worth a mention here.Universal Health primarily specializes in providing low cost care to underprivileged patients. Its acute care platform has been delivering strong underwriting results consistently. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.In addition, its behavioral platform has been performing well too. In fact, behavioral facility acquisitions help Universal Health win market share in the fast growing addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment continued to deliver strong results in the first half of 2017.In the last six months, the stock has lost 9.4%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 11%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock despite the challenging environment.However, the stock currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 1.1. This, although is below the median 1.2 of its range, it compares unfavorably with the industry average of 0.5. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its peers. In addition, the company’s high-debt level has been a concern over the last five years. This also led to a rise in interest expenses which could weigh on its margins.Another area of concern for the company is the increase in its operating expenses since 2013, which continued to rise in the first half of 2017. This also keeps hurting the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksUniversal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Investors interested in this space can consider stocks like Aetna, Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc.

141,ANTM,"The stock market has been on a stellar ride this year courtesy of a pickup in global economic activity, robust corporate earnings, and rising consumer confidence. But bouts of volatility and uncertainty have threatened the bull run lately.This is especially true as United States’ tensions with North Korea reached an alarming stage that could lead to a trade war with China, the largest trading partner of North Korea, thus sparking off threats of a global recession. Doubts over the implementation of Trump’s agenda, government shutdown fears, uncertain Fed policy as well as two hurricanes – Harvey aftermath and Irma – added to the gloom (read: ETFs to Lose If Trump Bans Trade With North Korean Partners).Amid these uncertainties, value investing appears safe and appealing to investors. The strategy includes stocks with strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market.Why Value Investing?Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect a company’s true long-term fundamentals. This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price.As a result, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared to growth and blend counterparts.

143,ANTM,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) boasts a strong inorganic growth story driven by its expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing post-acute care operations and transforming them into market leaders. These initiatives position the company well for robust organic growth.The company’s revenues have been growing since 2012. Apart from inorganic growth, the consistent strong performance by the Transitional & Skilled Services segment has also aided its top-line growth. The trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Ensign Group’s solid financial health also paves the way for several growth oriented capital deployment strategies. The company has been paying dividends since 2002 and has increased its payout annually for the past 14 years. Frequent share repurchases and dividends payments have helped it retain investors’ confidence in this stock. In the last one year, its shares have gained 5% while the industry declined nearly 27%.However, Ensign Group’s long-term debt level has been rising since 2011. The trend continued in first-half 2017 as well. This rising level of debt not only raises financial risks but also increases interest expenses which, in turn, hurt the margins.Rising level of operating expenses also leads to increase in total expenses. This severely affects the company’s bottom line.Ensign Group’s valuation looks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. It currently has a one-year P/S ratio of 0.6, which is above the industry average of 0.2.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEnsign Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

144,ANTM,"Molina Healthcare, Inc (MOH  -  Free Report) continues to grow on membership. Over last few years, aggregate membership consistently increased on the expansion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The uptrend in membership continued in the first half of 2017 as well on the back of increased Marketplace-enrollment and the acquisition of Medicaid managed care.The company’s aggressive inorganic strategies also pave the way for long-term growth. The acquisition of Universal American’s Total Care Medicaid plan in 2016 that substantially boosted the company’s Medicaid business, is worth a mention here.On the back of membership and inorganic growth, the company’s top line started witnessing consistent growth over the past few years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017 . Solid restructuring and development strategies have also significantly contributed to this top-line appreciation.In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 28%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18%. This reflects shareholders’ optimism in the stock.However, at the end of the second quarter, it withdrew its 2017 earnings guidance owing to uncertain medical cost trends and uncertainty around the funding of Marketplace cost sharing subsidies. This might put its share price under pressure, going forward.The company has been witnessing a rise in expenses due to higher medical care costs, over the past few years. Nevertheless, it has recently taken up a restructuring plan to improve its operational efficiency per which, it estimates annualized run-rate expenses to reduce significantly in late 2018.In addition, its high debt level also raises financial risk as well as interest expenses. Rising interest expenses also hurt its margins.Molina Healthcare’s Marketplace performance has been most disappointing in Florida, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. The uncertain future of ACA also affects the exchange business adversely.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMolina Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

146,ANTM,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has been growing on buyouts. During 2010-15, the company had made some major acquisitions that expanded its markets and increased its Medicaid membership. On the back of substantial growth in existing markets, expansion into new markets and broadening of its product offerings, the top line of the company witnessed a five-year (2011-16) compound annual growth rate of 50%. In 2017, the trend continued on the back of Health Net acquisition that added significantly to its top line.Year to date, its shares have gained 53%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 25%. This indicates shareholders’ optimism on the stock.Centene’s strong balance sheet continues to impress. Its solid cash position supports its organic and inorganic investments. For the first half of 2017, the company reported $942 million of operating cash-inflow against an outflow of $223 million in the year-ago quarter.However, the company is burdened with high level of long-term debt that has been consistently rising since 2005. This not only increases the financial risk but also raises interest expenses, which again hurt margins. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Moreover, its total expenses also kept rising since 2007 due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and premium tax costs.Its trailing 12-months return on equity of 14.6 not only deteriorated but also compares unfavorably with the industry average of 20.0, indicating that the company is less efficient in using investors’ fund.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCentene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

147,ANTM,"Telehealth company Teladoc, Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) has incurred significant losses in each reporting cycle since its inception.As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had an accumulated deficit of $204.7 million. For the first half of 2017, net loss was $31.1 million, 3% higher year over year. These losses and accumulated deficit stemmed from substantial investments made by the company to acquire new clients, build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform.Accordingly, we anticipate that cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase substantially in the near future. These initiatives may prove to be more expensive than currently estimated by the company and may not succeed in increasing its revenues sufficiently to offset higher expenses.For 2017, Teladoc is anticipated to report a loss of $1.52–$1.55 per share (down 12% year over year). The company’s prior losses, combined with its expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on its stockholders’ equity and working capital.The company’s operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and it intends to continue making significant investments to support its business growth. In each of the past three years, the company used cash flow from operations. We believe the company has a long way to go before it starts generating positive cash flow from operations.Also, the company’s debt has increased substantially in the past four years, leading to a spike in interest costs and consequently raising overall expense and eroding operating margin.Over the past three months, the stock has lost 1.5%, compared with gains of 2.9% for the industry it belongs to. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 loss being widened by 64% and 43%, respectively, over the last 30 days.Teladoc’s valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at Teladoc’s price-to-book value ratio, which is one of the measures to value a company witnessing negative earnings, investors may not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-book ratio of 4.1, which is significantly above 1.9 for the industry and 3.6 for the S&P 500.Teladoc’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undermines its growth potential. The company’s negative ROE of 13.1%, though moderated in the past two years, compares unfavorably with ROE of 23.7% for the industry and 15.9% for the S&P 500, reflecting its inefficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Stocks to ConsiderAetna Inc.

148,ANTM,"St. Louis, MO-based pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced results from a new diabetes study, Diabetes Dilemma: U.S. Trends in Diabetes Medication Use. Per the study, people following their oral diabetes medications experienced significantly fewer emergency room visits and inpatient hospitalizations. Further, the report revealed that they spent nearly $500 less on total healthcare costs compared to nonadherent patients.With strong criticism being voiced against high prices of specialty drugs, the focus is on better management of healthcare costs as consumers are becoming increasingly proactive about healthcare decisions. Through the study, Express Scripts emphasizes on the need for necessary patient spending for medications. This we feel would lead to experiencing an average increase in diabetes drug spend in 2017.In this regard, we remind investors that the company’s SafeGuard suite of pharmacy solutions was designed to better manage specialty spending, thereby establishing a higher standard for patient outcome. The portfolio also includes the Hepatitis Cure Value Program, the Cholesterol Care Value Program, the Oncology Care Value Program and the Express Scripts Inflation Protection Program.Over the past three months, the company has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained only 1.7%, compared with 2.9% rise of the industry it belongs to.Going forward, we are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management and long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, constant rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.However, Express Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated revenues worth $52.6 million compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

149,ANTM,"In the Q2 earnings season, the Hospital industry, part of the Healthcare sector gave an overall weak performance with softness in patient volumes, which adversely impacted revenues. Also, increased expenses hurt the bottom line and margins. Significant regulatory uncertainty is anticipated with ongoing efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Therefore stocks in this space have lost their sheen.One such stock is LifePoint Health Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report) that has been witnessing downward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ pessimism about its prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved down 2.9% and 2.8%, respectively.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost around 11.1% of its value in the last six months, in line with the industry.'s decline.Notably, LifePoint is also suffering from a number of other issues which makes it an underperformer.Why LifePoint is a SellTightening of Guidance: Following second-quarter results, the company trimmed its 2017 guidance. It now expects net revenues of $6.425 billion to $6.5 billion (versus the old estimate of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion); adjusted EBIDTA of $775 million to $795 million (previous range was $785 million to $815 million); adjusted EPS of $3.92 to $4.20 (previous guidance was $4.05 to $4.34). Equivalent admissions are expected to decline 0.5% or remain unchanged. The guidance reduction accounted for a challenging volume environment and weak revenue growth.Expenses Rising More Than Revenues: Life Point’s expenses have increased at a rate higher than the revenue growth rate from 2006-2016. The company, however, witnessed a 1.5% decline in total operating expenses in the first half of 2017.The company is experiencing an increase in professional fees and higher interest expenses due to increasing debt. It is also faced with higher depreciation and amortization as a result of an increase in spending on information systems and increase in supplies expenses due to recent acquisitions. These costs will lead to an increase in total expenses in the coming quarters.Increasing Bad Debts: To provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future, the company has established a provision for doubtful accounts. Its provision for doubtful accounts has been increasing for the past many years and the same was seen in the first half of 2017. The company has long struggled to collect unpaid bills as any increase in uncollectible bills will hit its bottom line.Overvalued: LifePoint’s valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 14.43, which is higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 13.75 for the industry.Stocks to ConsiderAetna Inc.

150,ANTM,"On Aug 16, the stock of Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $180.42. The rise in the stock is believed to have been driven by better-than-expected second-quarter results and a subsequent guidance raise.Cigna’s second-quarter earnings and revenues beat estimates by 17.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The earnings beat reflected strong contribution from each of the company’s business segments.Cigna pulled up its 2017 earnings guidance after strong results. It expects adjusted income from operations between $2.50 billion and $2.58 billion (previous estimate was $2.41 billion to $2.53 billion), or $9.75 to $10.05 per share ($9.25–$9.75).It, however, maintained the guidance for revenue growth rate at 3% to 4%, and the global medical customer growth range of 0.5 million to 0.6 million.In one year, the stock has rallied 35.6%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 30% and significantly higher than the return of 12.4% from the S&P 500 index.Investors also favorably viewed Cigna’s recent purchase of Zurich Insurance Middle East, which will strengthen its foothold in the Gulf countries of UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait and Oman. The deal will bolster its already strong international business, the premium at which has witnessed a 12% CAGR to $1.9 billion in 2016 from $0.9 billion in 2009.  This deal has made the company’s investors quite optimism about its efforts to diversify operations outside U.S. markets that are faced with stiff competition and stringent regulations.Shares also received a boost from the lifting of MA sanctions (last month) by CMS. The company was restricted to sell MA plans since Jan 2016, after it was found guilty of violating regulations relating to these.Now, with the sanctions lifted, Cigna will be able to participate in an open enrollment period for 2018 plans, which will start from Nov 1, 2017. The development will add to the company’s organic growth by increasing MA membership.Shares of the company have performed strongly despite the failed merger of Cigna with Anthem Inc. Cigna’s investors have the confidence in its ability to grow as a stand-alone entity.Recently, the company projected 2021 earnings per share (EPS) of $16, and an EPS annual growth guidance of 10-13%. The 2021 EPS guidance took into consideration substantial balance sheet strength of $7 billion to $14 billion deployable cash.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

153,ANTM,"Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has completed a public offering of $1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due to mature on Aug 15, 2047. The company intends to use $987.6 million in net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and to repay a portion of its 1.5% senior notes and floating-rate senior notes, both due in 2017.Prior to the completion of this issuance, these notes received rating action from A.M. Best. The rating giant assigned a Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “bbb” to these senior unsecured notes.Aetna’s financial solvency reflected substantial improvement after the early redemption of $10.2 billion of senior notes in February 2017, which were issued in 2016 to finance the then pending buyout of Humana, Inc (HUM  -  Free Report). However, following the termination of the buyout, Aetna redeemed a significant portion of that debt. As a result, the company’s financial leverage came down below 40% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 50% at the end of 2016.Per A.M Best, the debt issuance is likely to cause a marginal increase to Aetna’s debt-to-capital ratio until the forthcoming maturities are paid back in 2017. Nevertheless, the rating giant also believes the ratio will eventually go below 40%.Aetna witnessed a decline in its shareholders’ equity on Jun 30, 2017 from year-end 2016. The fall was due to its accelerated share repurchase and dividend hike. The company’s disciplined capital management is viewed favorably by investors. In last six months, the company’s shares have gained 25%, outpacing the industry’s rally of 21%.However, Aetna’s financial results were adversely impacted by the payment of the $1 billion merger termination fee to Humana in early 2017. Despite this, we remain optimistic about Aetna’s financial excellence backed by its group commercial and government business that posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter of 2017, supported largely by premium growth and modest cost trend.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAetna presently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors may also consider some other stocks in the same space like Anthem Inc.

The bottom line also compared unfavorably with earnings of 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.Operational UpdateIn the second quarter, total revenue of $5 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. The top line has also grew 15% year over year, primarily due to an increase in premium revenues and investment income.For the quarter, total operating expenses rose 24% year over year to $5.3 billion. This was due to higher medical care costs, increased cost of service revenues, rise in general and administrative expenses, higher premium tax expenses as well as depreciation and amortization costs and impairment losses.For the quarter, medical care cost increased 25% year over year to $4.5 billion due to out-of-period claims development, particularly at the Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Puerto Rico health plans.Continuously rising debt burden resulted in Molina Healthcare’s interest expenses increasing 8% year over year to $27 million.Molina Healthcare Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molina Healthcare Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molina Healthcare Inc QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, Molina Healthcare’s cash and cash equivalents increased 6% from year-end 2016 to $3 billion.Total assets grew 15% from the end of 2016 to $8.6 billion.The company’s shareholder equity declined 7.8% from year-end 2016 to $1.5 billion.Net cash used in operating activities totaled $47 million in the second quarter, down from $139 million used in the year-ago quarter.Restructuring and Profit Improvement PlanDue to the Molina Healthcare’s poor operating performance, it intends to implement a comprehensive restructuring and profitability improvement plan. Under the plan the company would streamline its organizational structure to improve efficiency as well as the speed and quality of decision-making.The company would re-design core operating processes, remediate high cost provider contracts and build high quality, cost-effective networks. Molina Healthcare will also restructure its existing direct delivery operations and review its vendor base.The company expects the Restructuring Plan to reduce annualized run-rate expenses by approximately $300 million to $400 million upon its completion in late 2018. Molina Healthcare also estimates that total pre-tax costs associated with the Restructuring Plan will be approximately $130–$150 million for the second half of 2017, with an additional $40 million to be incurred in 2018.Molina Healthcare expects a reduction of $200 million to annualized run-rate expenses resulting from staff reductions expected to be achieved by the end of 2017 and in time for full realization in 2018.Direct delivery operations will be restructured during the second half of 2017 and Marketplace participation will be terminated in Utah and Wisconsin in 2018.2017 GuidanceAt the end of first-quarter 2017, the company projected earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be $2.53 and $2.90, respectively for 2017.However, at the end the second quarter, the company withdrew its 2017 earnings guidance owing to uncertain medical cost trends in the Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico health plans, uncertainty around the funding of Marketplace cost sharing subsidies and potential variability in the timing of benefits achieved and costs incurred as a result of the Restructuring Plan.Our TakeDespite its numerous restructuring initiatives, Molina Healthcare's disappointing second-quarter results along with several headwinds faced by the company make us skeptical of its ability to return to profit any time soon.

160,ANTM,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of $3.49 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by approximately 13%. The bottom line improved 6% year over year, primarily driven by the company’s individual Medicare Advantage and Individual Commercial businesses,partially offset by lower pretax earnings in the Group and Specialty and Healthcare Services segments.Operational UpdateAdjusted consolidated revenues of $13.3 billion grew 2% on higher Retail segment revenues from the company’s Medicare business, excluding the impact of revenues from its Individual Commercial business. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 83.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10.7% improved 130 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.30 billion, up 3% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business.Benefit ratio of 85.8% deteriorated 50 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 8.5% improved 130 bps year over year because of the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $613 million jumped 18% year over year, primarily due to lower benefit and operating cost ratios.Group and Specialty SegmentRevenues from the Group and Specialty segment were $1.83 billion, down 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due a decline in average group fully-insured and ASO commercial medical membership.Benefit ratio deteriorated 100 bps year over year to 78.4%, due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. Operating cost ratio improved 110 bps year over year to 21.6%, due to the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $102 million decreased 19% year over year due to the timing of revenues under the company’s TRICARE contract primarily relating to medical cost trend incentives and amounts for additional services requested under the contract.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $5.98 decreased 5% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio remained flat year over year at 95%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $281 million, down 3% year over year due to ongoing pressures in the company’s provider services business. This reflects lower Medicare rates year over year in specific geographies, as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management programs.Individual Commercial SegmentIndividual Commercial membership was 0.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 77% year over year, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on-exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off-exchange products.Benefit ratio of 34.8% rose 106 bps from second-quarter 2016. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the effect of the $208 million increase in the PDR in the prior-year quarter, planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio, and per-member premium increase.The segment’s operating cost ratio deteriorated 140 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.2%, primarily due the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017The company witnessed a pretax income of $118 million, which compared favorably with a pretax loss of $225 million in the prior year quarter. This was owing to the exit from certain markets in 2017 and per-member premium increases.Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc.

The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings year over year and the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by the portion of taxes paid in the quarter related to the merger termination fee.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn Feb 2017, Humana’s board of directors approved a $2.25 billion share repurchase authorization, which will expire on Dec 31, 2017.The company subsequently entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution to bring into effect a $1.50 billion ASR program under the authorization.Given the outstanding ASR, the company did not execute any share repurchases in the second quarter.The company paid cash dividends to its stockholders of $57 million in the second quarter.Guidance Raised Humana increased its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 from the previous guidance of at least $11.10.

The bottom line also jumped 1.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.2 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion.

The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 6% to $21.2 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 3% rise in total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and 2.3% higher interest expenses, on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 86.1% deteriorated 190 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.

Total debt, at the end of the quarter was $13.84 billion versus $14.85 billion at the end of 2016.

For fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings per share are projected in the band of $6.95 to $7.05, up from the previously provided range of $6.90 to $7.04.

(ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated $52.6 million in revenues compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Our TakeWe are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, INSYS Therapeutics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

168,ANTM,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 21.56%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterAnthem is likely to witness an increase in its overall enrollment, primarily backed by substantial medical enrollment growth.Solid revenue growth is expected in both of its Government Business and Commercial Business, backed by strong enrollment growth.The Iowa Medicaid contract is likely to have boosted the company’s top line significantly.Medicare Advantage product offerings might have supported Medicare enrollment growth, again boosting the company’s top-line.However, Anthem expects to witness higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products, as was the case last quarter.In addition, the company is also likely to have experienced higher benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business due to higher claims.Administrative costs might have risen during the second quarter, continuing the previous quarter’s trend.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Anthem is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anthem has an Earnings ESP of -1.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $3.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Anthem currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

169,ANTM,"Healthcare stocks are back in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” not meeting with much success and basically collapsing.A quick look at the events that have unfolded over the past few months shows that “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action, once elected, for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately. However, the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill (the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare) being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill.Then in June, the Senate issued its version, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, with certain changes being made -- however, four Republican Senators (Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Lee) issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor. While the Senators acknowledged that the draft bill was an improvement to the current health care system, they noted that it did not appear to accomplish the goal of repealing Obamacare and making health care more affordable.Last week, the Senate came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support with Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announcing earlier this week that they will not vote for the current version of the bill. Moreover, moderate senators were concerned by the cuts to Medicaid.Repeal Now, Replace LaterWith efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing, the focus has now shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement -- the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017. But what will the repercussions be if such a move is taken?According to a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) yesterday, enacting this legislation would cut federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade. However, the number of uninsured people would go up by 17 million in 2018 and average premiums in the nongroup market would increase by about 25%.Once the ACA’s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the ACA are eliminated, the number of uninsured Americans would go up by 27 million in 2020 with premiums rising about 50%. 2026 would see the uninsured go up by 32 million with premiums doubling compared to the current law. Given these numbers, it doesn’t seem likely that “Repeal Now, Replace Later” will get much support.Impact on Healthcare StocksAs the “Repeal Now, Replace Later” scenario plays out, hospital and insurance stocks will remain in the limelight. Insurance stocks have had a very strong run so far in 2017 with the Zacks-categorized Medical - Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry outperforming the S&P 500 with the industry climbing 22% compared to the overall market gain of 10.7%. Not surprisingly, the HMO industry is among the top 13% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hospital stocks have also had a pretty decent run so far this year though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement. This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage. Repealing and/or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals. The Zacks-categorized Medical-Hospital industry is currently among the bottom 30% of the Zacks-ranked industries.With healthcare reform expected to remain a key topic of discussion, expect volatility and uncertainty in this corner of the healthcare market in the near-term.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

171,ANTM,"Debt financing is nothing new in the world of investment and only a fortunate few can avoid it. Most corporates resort to debt financing to ensure smooth business operations. This is because companies do not have unlimited funds and they need to boost their financial resources from time to time to expand operations.In fact, given the easy availability and affordability of debt compared to equity, in the majority of matured economies, the debt market is bigger than the equity market in terms of market capitalization. America – the richest economy in the world – is the biggest borrower too.However, resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments.In this context, it is imperative to note that the debt scenario in the U.S. is quite disturbing at this moment. Huge spending on wars, big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation’s burden over the years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150% of the economy’s GDP in 2047 from 77% currently.Nevertheless, this should not dissuade investors from investing in stocks as debt has been a part of the U.S. economy since its foundation. What investors need to do is to follow a prudent investment strategy and choose stocks that are burdened with lesser amount of debt.Herein comes the significance of financial leverage ratio. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage, or the extent of debt a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed historically for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popular among them.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio implies a more financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.As debt-ridden companies are more prone to bankruptcy in times of financial crisis, the very foundation of making safe investment is to avoid high-leverage stocks.With the market gearing up for second-quarter releases, investors tend to get attracted to stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth, overlooking the debt on their balance sheet. Therefore to avoid huge losses we would urge investors to go for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratio.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion, it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt-to-equity ratio.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGMScore of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): It manufactures and sells building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structures, as well as light industrial and commercial construction.
