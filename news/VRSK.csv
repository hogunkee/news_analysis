27,VRSK,"Square (SQ), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) held up nicely Tuesday even as financial stocks overall tumbled from Italy's political woes. Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly. Payments firms PayPal and Square also are largely insulated from interest rates, though Square does make some loans to small businesses. Verisk provides underwriting data analytics to the insurance industry.Here's how these five financial stocks, each of which is in a buy zone or near a buy point, are performing.

32,VRSK,"The poor stock market performance in March and the first quarter took its toll on many of the best mutual funds, according to IBD's latest Best Mutual Funds Performance Report. But mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD are not hitting the panic button yet. In fact, they point to a silver lining.""The pullback has taken some of the richness out of stock valuations,"" said Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal, co-manager of $2.8 billion Glenmede Large Cap Core Fund (GTLOX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Awards list. ""A drop in valuations is good,"" he added.Meanwhile, how weak was stock market performance? March's 2.54% setback marked the S&P 500's second straight monthly decline after 15 straight monthly gains. The bogey's 0.76% Q1 reversal was its first after nine straight quarterly advances. Likewise, the 0.93% March decline by the average U.S. diversified stock mutual fund was its second in a row after five monthly climbs. The group's 0.38% Q1 shrinkage was its first after seven quarterly gains in a row.Investors were jolted in part by fears of inflation, de Vassal said. That arose from January's strong payroll numbers — 200,000 jobs created instead of the 180,000 that were expected — and 2.9% rise in average hourly wages versus the prior year. Later downward revisions eased investors' concerns, but those jitters were replaced by new ones stemming from concerns about a possible trade war, sparked by U.S. tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel, and the falloff by technology stocks.Still, many mutual fund managers look beyond the weak March and Q1 stock market performance and see encouraging signs. ""The economy looks good,"" said Chip Reed, co-manager of $11.6 billion Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX), another 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. ""The market looks good. We have the tax stimulus package. We have global synchronized recovery in economic growth for the first time since the 1990s. It doesn't get better than this.""Despite U.S. diversified stock mutual funds' March fall, small-cap growth funds managed a 1.23% gain. That made them the best-performing subgroup. They also led Q1 overall by advancing 3.13%.And in contrast to the losses on average by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in March and Q1, world equity funds eked out a 0.11% Q1 gain despite slipping 0.85% in March. Pacific ex Japan funds led world regions in March by posting the smallest setback, 0.35%. Latin American funds led foreign stock fund categories in Q1 with a 5.57% advance.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the weakest market moved sharply in the opposite direction. India region funds plunged 7.51% in Q1, trimming their five-year average annual gain to 11.90%, still best among foreign stock markets.Among major sectors, real estate funds topped the pack in March with a 3.36% gain. Global science/technology funds' 5.53% advance was tops in Q1.Precious metals funds did worst among sectors in Q1, plummeting 7.21%, despite gaining 1.93% in March amid jitters about inflation and a possible trade war.On average, taxable bond funds gained in March but lost ground in Q1. Tax-exempt bond funds as a group also rose in March but sank in Q1.Despite the macro factors fueling his constructive outlook, Eaton Vance's Reed added that a trade war and high valuations could disrupt the party. ""You need to be cautious,"" he said.Matthew Moberg, lead manager of $5 billion Franklin DynaTech (FKDNX), a third 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner, says investors should expect continued volatility for the rest of this year. Otherwise, he is constructive. ""A combination of tax reform and earnings increases is good,"" he said. ""And inflation is being held in check by large internet platforms.""Further, despite the recent tech stock sell-off, Moberg's tech-focused fund remains bullish on select tech names. ""The fund invests in innovation,"" Moberg said. ""Places where we are invested still have a lot of secular growth.""In cloud computing, Moberg likes the huge lead that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have in a growing market. In mobile advertising, he says Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are growing and enjoying solid profitability.Three companies dominate chipmaking. He owns Intel (INTC) but not Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). In the payments arena, he cites secular growth by Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).In the software space, he likes ServiceNow (NOW). ""This company helps information-technology departments,"" Moberg said. ""Their software is finding new applications.""Reed looks for all-weather stocks. ""We look for holdings that can do well in any environment,"" he said. ""Our holdings tend to be companies that are somewhat immune to the economic cycle.""One is Verisk Analytics (VRSK). ""They sell data on insurance claims (mainly to property and casualty) insurance companies that they receive from other insurers,"" Reed said. ""They have a reservoir of information and tax records."" The company also has an insurance unit focused on risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power-generation, and metals and mining industries.Markel (MKL) is another Reed favorite. ""They're a specialty insurance company,"" he said. ""They don't compete with big insurers. They underwrite insurance for bars, day care centers. The risks are higher, but that enables them to demand higher premiums.""Reed also holds Blackbaud (BLKB), a cloud software company focused on nonprofits. ""They design software that helps nonprofits run their business, from the accounting side to the fundraising side.""Blackbaud's programs enable nonprofits to focus on core missions rather than allocate resources to developing their own software, Reed said. ""They are dominant in that industry, and they expanding into education,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeIn A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course With Your Mutual Funds?

35,VRSK,"Stocks continued to hold narrow gains heading into the final hour of Wednesday's regular trading session, boosted by higher oil prices and positive jobs data.

Volume was lower across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Oil stocks led the upside in the stock market today, as West Texas intermediate crude prices rebounded more than 3% to $40.80 a barrel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a 1.4 million barrel rise in crude oil supplies in the latest week, but a larger than expected decline in gasoline supplies.Computer hardware, food and gold stocks lagged. Gold futures were down nearly 1% to $1.363.70 an ounce.In economic news, U.S. private employers added 178,600 jobs in July, according to ADP's National Employment Report. That came in well ahead of forecasts for a dip to 165,000 jobs, from June's 172,000 new hires.Pfizer (PFE) again weighed on the Dow as the drug giant slumped 3% in above-average turnover and sliced its 50-day moving average. It fell 2.5% Tuesday despite a quarterly beat.But Apple, Disney and Goldman Sachs (GS) led blue chips, each with an advance of more than 1%.On the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) surged 6% to a new high in heavy trade, after reporting Q2 results late Tuesday that topped views.

"
37,VRSK,"TransUnion (TRU) may not be the hottest name in the market or have the same brand recognition as, say, Apple (AAPL), but its stock has been on fire of late.A growing consumer credit market is benefiting the provider of consumer reports, risk scores and analytics, and TransUnion's diversification is helping it stand out from the pack. The company has transformed beyond its consumer credit roots and into a diversified risk management analytics firm. That's translated to soaring organic revenue growth and significant share price gains.Helping the Chicago-based company is what JPMorgan says is its extension into data sets that had been underutilized by consumer credit reporting vendors. That includes public records data such as court judgments, bankruptcies, liens, marriages and divorces. There's also driver history data as well as alternative data, including information on consumers with thin credit files.""While modest in scope currently, these unique offerings are growing quickly and morph TransUnion from a traditional (consumer reporting agency) into a diversified risk management solutions firm with an expanded addressable market,"" JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman said in an April 27 note to clients.He added that this evolution helps distinguish the June 2015 initial public offering from its primary competitors, namely Experian and Equifax (EFX), which is a member of Investor's Business Daily's IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks. The analyst notes that TransUnion is increasing its comparability to companies such as privately held LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) as well.A Zacks Equity Research report on May 10 noted the company’s financial appeal, saying it has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and cash flows that are ""strong and stable.""""Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, the top 5 credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders, thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies,"" the Zacks report added.That recipe of a strong business model and notable client exposure had a positive impact on the company’s latest quarterly results. After the market close on April 26, TransUnion reported a 60% rise in first-quarter adjusted earnings to 32 cents a share, beating analyst estimates for 26 cents. Revenue climbed 15% to $406 million for the quarter, handily topping projections for $380 million.""In our view, a beat in (2016's first quarter) was perhaps foreseeable, but the extent to which (TransUnion's) results outperformed despite lapping tougher (year-over-year) comps was exemplary,"" JPMorgan's Steinerman said.TransUnion’s U.S. information services segment saw revenue grow 13% to $247 million, accounting for 57% of the top line total. Revenue from the company’s international business increased 7% to 68 million, with 5% of the growth due to acquisitions. The company said the international segment’s revenue growth would have been 22% on a constant currency basis.Consumer interactive revenue jumped 25% to $105 million, driven by strength in both direct and indirect solutions.""The new growth initiative investments, and productivity investments at Spark (a company analytics and technology investment project) are together helping to fuel not only impressive top line growth, but also notable margin expansion,"" said TransUnion Chief Executive Jim Peck during the company's quarterly conference call on April 26.TransUnion raised its full-year guidance, but it was on the conservative side. The company sees 2016 EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.34, up from $1.24 to $1.28 previously. The midpoint of $1.32 was a hair below projections for $1.33.TransUnion upped its revenue expectation to $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, from $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, while analysts have modeled $1.66 billion.""While representing a slowdown from 2015’s remarkable growth rates, 2016 guidance is likely lower due to mortgage assumptions, tough year-over-year comps, and beginning-of-year conservatism,"" Steinerman said. ""We find these goals achievable and we note guidance’s implication that (TransUnion's) breadth and pace of growth will remain best-in-class.""Wall Street seems to have agreed. Shares vaulted 8.5% the day after the report to become extended from the 5% buy range from a cup-with-handle base it initially broke out of on March 29. Shares are now extended roughly 14% from the 27.15 buy point, after hitting a new all-time high and nearing the 20% profit-taking zone on May 10.TransUnion has risen roughly 38% from its June 2015 IPO price of 22.50. The stock earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, meaning it outperforms 98% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative share price performance.Looking ahead, TransUnion has more growth opportunities -- though it has strong prior-year metrics to compete against.""While we acknowledge tougher comps in the back half of the year, we are comfortable with (TransUnion's) forecasted margin expansion and continued strength in emerging verticals such as healthcare and insurance, in addition to the (2016's second half) launch of trended data with Fannie Mae that should boost performance,"" Cowen and Company analyst George Mihalos said in an April 27 research report.Steinerman says the company's management team is a ""critical component"" to the company's success.""Under current broad leadership, the company has diversified into tangential data sets/data analytics and has overhauled its technology infrastructure,"" he said.

"
144,VRSK,"Verisk Analytics has watched its stock price soar to new highs, again and again, after its quarterly earnings reports. The stock notched a new high a couple of weeks ago after the company reported second-quarter earnings. The same thing occurred after it posted first-quarter and 2014 fourth-quarter results.Verisk (VRSK) provides risk assessment services and decision analytics to professionals in a variety of fields, including property/casualty insurance, financial services, health care, government, human resources and energy — the last of which it entered in May via the biggest acquisition in its history.The company has been on a pretty good roll of late, with three straight quarters of accelerated earnings gains.Earnings AccelerateAfter the close on July 28, Verisk posted a 35% year-over-year earnings increase — its biggest in at least a dozen quarters. Results easily surpassed consensus analyst views. The next day Verisk stock climbed 9% to a record high of 79.88 intraday before closing up 7% to 78.60.Similar spikes occurred on April 29, a day after Verisk reported Q1 results, and on Feb. 25, the day after it reported 2014 fourth-quarter earnings.How does Verisk view such stock action?""It's always interesting to try to understand that. Fundamentally, I'd say all of our verticals are doing well,"" said Eva Huston, Verisk's senior vice president and chief knowledge officer.In addition, she told IBD, the company has ""a lot of consistency"" in terms of financial performance.""Investors value that,"" she said.That consistency is partly the result of having expertise that spans more than 40 years.Verisk was founded in 1971 when Insurance Services Office, or ISO, launched operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry. The original business remains part of the company's Risk Assessment segment. Verisk also operates a Decision Analytics segment, which now makes up the bulk of the business.The Risk Assessment segment primarily helps property/casualty customers define, measure and manage risk via the flagship ISO subsidiary as well as several other units. The products and tools include data and statistical services, actuarial services, standardized insurance policy programs, underwriting information and rating-integrity tools.Its Decision Analytics segment provides a wide variety of customers with tools to help them make informed decisions about managing their assets and risk. These tools are used to predict future losses, select and price risk, detect and prevent fraud and quantify losses that have already happened.Decision Analytics Drive GrowthIn the second quarter, the Decision Analytics business posted a 24.6% revenue increase to $325.9 million, with more than half of the gain coming from the insurance sector. Revenue in the Risk Assessment segment grew 6% to $171.7 million.Total revenue for Verisk rose 17.5% to $497.6 million. Organic revenue, which excluded recent acquisitions and other items, grew 9.4% year over year.Verisk's second-quarter earnings came in at 77 cents a share, up 35.1% from a year earlier and well above consensus estimates for 66 cents.Technology Pays BackMuch of Verisk's recent profit growth can be traced to what it calls a ""build it once, sell it many times"" revenue model, as well as investments the company has made in new solutions, Huston says.""Over the past few years we have been doing more investing in our business, thinking up new analytics to help customers run their businesses better,"" she said.Huston cites the company's investments into its new software platform called Touchstone. Touchstone is designed to perform advanced analytics to help companies better assess their risk.""That took a fair amount of investment, but it allows us to increase our revenue growth,"" Huston said. ""We are now providing a solution that might have been used in a small portion of the insurance industry before, but can now be used by underwriters and a wider portion of the industry.""Similar investments have been made in Verisk's aerial imagery tools. Among other things, these tools let insurance customers view structures from their computers to assess associated risk. This lets them avoid the time and cost of visiting the structures themselves.Verisk's biggest investment came in May, when it closed its $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, a Scotland-based provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metal and mining industries.One major benefit of the acquisition — the biggest in Verisk's history — is that it greatly expands the company's global footprint.""Wood Mackenzie has offices around the world — in Tokyo, Hong Kong, China, Australia, all throughout Europe,"" Huston said. ""We can leverage that footprint into selling our existing solutions into those markets. For example, we have the opportunity to expand our footprint into China, where we didn't have a presence.""In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman noted that ""WoodMac has the ability to transform Verisk on the global front,"" though the acquisition ""bears risk due to its energy end market."" He also expects reinvestments in WoodMac ""to boost revenues over the medium term.""The deal has already paid bottom-line benefits, notes Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Arash Soleimani: ""Verisk's (Q2) outperformance relative to our estimate stemmed mostly from likely recurring tax benefits associated with WoodMac's UK domicile and higher-than-expected gross margins.""Apple And Android AppsMeanwhile, Verisk continues to broaden its product lineup. On Aug. 5, it announced that its Verisk Insurance Solutions unit launched the ISO ClaimSearch mobile application available on Apple's (AAPL) iTunes and Google 's (GOOG) Google Play.The app gives subscribers, including adjusters and investigators, a new tool that provides real-time access to the company's database of claims.""ISO ClaimSearch mobile users will see instant search results to help them investigate and adjust claims more efficiently, whether they're on a roof, in a salvage yard, in a home, at a business, or at a catastrophe site,"" Carlos Martins, vice president and general manager of ISO ClaimSearch Solutions, said in a statement.Users will be able to securely access the claims inquiry function on ISO ClaimSearch via their iPhone, iPad or Android phone and tablet.Verisk has an IBD Composite Rating of 95. The company belongs to IBD's Commercial Services-Market Research group, which ranks No. 64 of 197 industries tracked. The group's biggest stocks by market cap are Thomson Reuters (TRI) and Moody's (MCO).

187,VRSK,"There's an old saying about something being as bad as ""a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.""On a stock chart, the Nasdaq's dive from a short-term high July 22 to an intraday low Aug. 9 felt like a poke in the eye with a sharp stick 1.In just 12 sessions, the Nasdaq lopped off 527 points, or 18%.Insult was added to injury a few months later when the Nasdaq marked a lower intraday low Oct. 4 2. But that move wasn't straight down. It was more like ""a slap across the face with a wet fish,"" which offers its own form of investing discomfort.Forced to choose between the two pains, most investors would rather suffer a slap across the face with a wet fish than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Yet whatever damage was suffered from July to October, disciplined investors were asking this question: What stocks outperformed during this back-to-back turmoil?The outperformers were, and in some cases still are, worth a look. A stock that outperforms the market during a negative swing is showing strength. Sometimes, though not always, that strength will persist, providing future opportunities.Let's go back and look at the period from late July to early October. What stocks did well?Some stocks — such as credit card provider MasterCard (MA), drug developer Celgene (CELG) and risk assessment services provider Verisk Analytics (VRSK) — showed strength by finishing that period only 1% down vs. the Nasdaq's 18% drop.Now, no investor is in the game to lose less than the averages. Getting poor slowly is no virtue. But a stock that keeps its loss small during a big decline is showing extraordinary strength. Such stocks probably belong on a watch list.Other stocks actually notched gains during the decline from July 22 through Oct. 3. They include:• Discount retailer Dollar General (DG), which rose 11%. The stock shaped a cup-with-handle base and broke out past a 34.27 buy point Aug. 30.• Randgold Resources (GOLD), up 9%. The stock broke out in mid-July and advanced while the market corrected.• Newmont Mining (NEM), up 8%. The stock cleared a resistance area in a consolidation in late August.• Dollar Tree (DLTR), up 7%. The stock broke out of a seven-week base in late August.• AutoZone (AZO), up 5%. The stock cleared a pattern in late August.• O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), up 4%. The stock cleared a V-shaped pattern in early September.• Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), up 3%. The stock cleared a six-week consolidation in September.• Advance Auto Parts (AAP), up 1%. This stock made the list on a technicality. While it rose 1% during the July-October turbulence, it began sliding sharply in May.

220,VRSK,"S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) recently inked an agreement to acquire Kensho Technologies Inc. for approximately $550 million in a combination of cash and stock, to boost its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and thwart competition. The transaction is likely to be completed by early second-quarter 2018, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and other regulatory approvals.Based in Cambridge, MA, Kensho is a premier provider of next-generation AI, analytics, machine learning and data visualization systems to leading investment firms and banks in the Wall Street as well as the National Security community. This Harvard Square start-up firm has created a niche market for itself since its inception in 2013 by developing and deploying scalable AI systems to solve some of the hardest analytical problems across the globe.The buyout will facilitate S&P Global to improve its core operations by applying actionable insights through the use of AI solutions and sophisticated algorithms, thereby augmenting its efficacy. On the other hand, the transaction will enable Kensho to leverage S&P Global’s deep data sets, global-scale analytics platforms, essential benchmarks and strong leadership team to better serve clients while retaining the independent brand identity.The acquisition is the second of its kind. The first was S&P Global’s buyout of a New York-based data analytics private company, Panjiva Inc. in February. Panjiva — a leader in machine learning and data analytics — provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets. It offers customers macro data covering 95% of global trade flows and transactional data covering 35% of the same. S&P Global expects Panjiva to enhance its Global Market Intelligence's data and analytical offerings for diverse customers throughout the world, generating higher top-line growth. With such opportune acquisitions, S&P Global has outperformed the industry in the last six months with an average return of 24.2% compared with a gain of 13% for the latter.S&P Global expects the Kensho acquisition to be dilutive to its GAAP earnings for 2018 and has accordingly revised its earlier guidance. It currently expects GAAP earnings in the range of $7.95-$8.10 per share, down from earlier expectations of $8.15-$8.30. However, adjusted earnings’ guidance is reiterated at $8.45-$8.60 per share.S&P Global carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

222,VRSK,"The earnings season is at its tail end with bulk of the S&P 500 companies having reported results. Various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar analysis of two leading players in the Business Services sector to pick the best investment option based on the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings scorecard.Fourth-Quarter EarningsVerisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report) reported solid results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings. Net income from continuing operations improved to $204.6 million from $107.5 million in the year-earlier quarter on top-line growth. On a per share basis, net income from continuing operations increased to $1.22 from 63 cents in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $225.4 million or $1.34 per share compared with $135.4 million or 80 cents per share in the prior-year period. Excluding the benefit from the tax reform, adjusted earnings for the quarter were 81 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Total revenues for the reported quarter improved 12.7% to $570.3 million due to modest organic growth across all businesses. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $557 million.TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) reported strong results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings on the back of attractive new product launches, rapid vertical growth and solid performance in the international markets. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $94.8 million or 50 cents per share compared with $81.6 million or 44 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $245.1 million or $1.29 per share compared with $49.5 million or 27 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The surge was aided by benefits from the newly enacted tax law.Total quarterly revenues came in at $506.1 million compared with $435.9 million in the year-ago quarter. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $488 million. This healthy top-line growth was aided by strong year-over-year rise in revenues in each of its business segments.Price PerformanceIn the last three months, Verisk has outperformed the industry with an average return of 8.2% compared with a 7.6% gain for the latter. TransUnion has underperformed the industry with an average return of 3.1% during the same time frame. Estimate RevisionsOver the last 30 days, Verisk’s current-quarter estimates were revised upward to 91 cents per share from 82 cents while that for the current year increased from $3.53 to $3.96.TransUnion’s current-quarter estimates were raised to 51 cents per share from 48 cents while that for the current year increased from $2.15 to $2.30 during the same time period.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although there is not much to choose from as the stocks seem to match on most counts, Verisk seems to have trumped TransUnion on the basis of positive estimate revisions and price performance and stands out as a better investment option.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

223,VRSK,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report) has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13.2%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 27.7% and 9.6% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company’s price performance over the past year looks impressive. Share of Verisk have gained 31.7%, outperforming the industry’s and S&P 500’s gain of 27.8% and 14.3%, respectively. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s solid organic growth and benefits from multiple strategic business moves like investments, acquisitions and agreements.Robust Organic GrowthVerisk continues to witness higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working with its customers to understand their evolving needs.Notably, Verisk’s recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years. In 2017, total revenues grew 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis. In first-quarter 2018, total revenues grew 7% on an organic constant-currency basis.Verisk aims to create long-term value through organic growth. It continues to extend its footprint in new markets, with healthy long-term growth potential, through targeted international expansion. This holistic growth model will help it to strengthen its leading position in the market.Subscription & Long-Term ContractsVerisk continues to earn the majority of its revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements. As of Mar 31, 2018, Verisk’s three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 82%, 80% and 75% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Verisk’s operation in a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration helps mitigate operational risks. With high barriers to entry in the industry, Verisk also enjoys a dominant position.Advanced TechnologiesWe appreciate Verisk’s expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect, interpret and analyze different types of data sets in real time and at scale. The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing, which primarily drive the company’s business. A majority of the technologies used by Verisk is developed, maintained and supported by almost 20% of its employees.The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands look impressive. Such a deep technical prowess for analytics and Big Data provide it an unrivalled edge over its competitors. All these initiatives augur well for long-term growth and stability of the company.Strategic Acquisitions Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. From 2015-2017, the company completed 21 acquisitions. In 2018 so far, the company has acquired two companies — Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. Both these buyouts will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Verisk’s long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. Internally, it is focused on evaluating and integrating acquisitions that are valuable for its shareholders. Further, acquisitions have contributed to its first-quarter 2018 earnings. The company continues to look for strategic acquisitions.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Verisk’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Verisk returned 276.3 million, $326.8 million and $20.4 million to its shareholders, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $366.2 million available for buyback. Since the launch of the company’s share repurchase plan in May 2010, the company’s board of directors has authorized up to $2.8 billion for the purpose. In first-quarter 2018, the company repurchased 382,508 shares for an aggregate amount of $40 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had $326 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Verisk’s performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.8%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.00, indicating year-over-year growth of 21.9%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.Despite having a bullish Zacks Rank #2, we are not confident of an earnings beat for Verisk in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Further, our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv and ServiceMaster are likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter, despite carrying a Zacks Rank #3. This is because both the companies have negative Earnings ESP.Overall, it is difficult to predict an earnings beat for the abovementioned business services stocks.Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors are likely to focus on the companies’ fundamentals to make investment decisions.

233,VRSK,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 14. The company’s Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”) segment, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues, is anticipated to generate higher revenues in the quarter.Whether this will lead to higher earnings remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementInterpublic is poised to grow on the back of its strong digital capabilities, diversified business model and extensive geographic presence. The company is anticipated to achieve targeted levels in the quarter based on diversification across emerging regions along with collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets are likely to translate into higher revenues.The Group’s best-in-industry talent and tools are expected to offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus rendering an edge over its peers.

234,VRSK,"The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% in the prior quarter, largely due to higher imports as consumer spending recorded the highest rise in three years. The paradoxical GDP tally masks the bullish overall economic sentiment buoyed by some sweeping policy changes by President Donald Trump.The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35% to 21% has boosted corporate earnings, stoked investments and trickled down to employees in some instances. In addition, Trump’s pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remained tailwinds. Improvements in the labor market and rise in wages have led to higher consumer spending. Additionally, three interest rate hikes in 2017 by the Fed, indicating inherent economic stability, have boosted investors’ confidence.Economic Growth MomentumThe U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in December as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 59.7%, bringing the average tally for 2017 to 57.6% — the highest since 2004. Fueled by domestic business investments, improving global economies and steady spending by American households, the manufacturing activity is likely to move north in the near future.  There were 148,000 job additions in December and the economy added about 2 million jobs in 2017. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% - the lowest in 17 years, due to higher participation rate of 62.7% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving. Wages improved 2.5% from the year-ago period.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence index increased to 125.4 in January from 123.1 in December, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let’s take a look at how the fourth-quarter earnings are shaping up so far for the business services sector.Business Services Sector PerformanceAbout 15.4% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings through Jan 24, 2018. With a ‘beat ratio’ of 75%, total earnings for these companies are up 10.7% year over year. Revenues increased 7.7% from the year-ago period, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 75%.The entire sector is expected to perform lower than the overall index. The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 6.8% versus 11.6% for the S&P 500. (Read: Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon's Q4 Earnings)The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise is likely to help these stocks outperform in the near term.How to Pick?The Business Services sector covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. Amid a diverse range of companies in this arena, picking the right stock for your portfolio might appear to be a colossal task.

243,VRSK,"The U.S. GDP is likely to grow around 1.5% in the third quarter, a fall from 2.1% in the prior quarter, mainly due to the devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma. Despite the setbacks, the overall economic sentiment remained fairly bullish buoyed by some sweeping policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump, which are likely to take effect in the ensuing quarters.The investor-friendly policies including a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and regulatory rollbacks, are likely to spur higher consumer spending. They are also expected to create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. The GDP is expected to pick up pace in the fourth quarter and grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% as Trump’s policies gradually take center stage, tempered slightly by the geopolitical situations across the globe.Economic Growth MomentumU.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance and reached a 13-year high in September as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 60.8% — the highest since May 2004. This also serves as a precursor to the solid economic growth expected in the near future.On an average, there were 172,000 job additions per month till September, when the economy lost 33,000 net jobs due to natural calamities. However, the unemployment rate fell to a 16-month low to 4.2% in September due to higher participation rate of 63.1% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index decreased slightly to 119.8 in September from 120.4 in August due to the storms, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let’s take a look at how the third-quarter earnings are shaping up so far for the business services sector.Business Services Sector PerformanceAbout 16.7% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings results through Oct 18, 2017. With a ‘beat ratio’ of 100%, total earnings for these companies are up 11.6% year over year.

The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 0.8% versus 3% for the S&P 500.

244,VRSK,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Verisk Beats Q2 Earnings on Healthy Organic GrowthVerisk reported solid second-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings from continuing operations. Revenues also increased from the prior-year quarter.Net income from continuing operations improved to $121.0 million from $106.8 million in the year-earlier quarter primarily driven by top-line growth. On a per share basis, net income from continuing operations increased to $0.72 from $0.62 in the year-earlier quarter.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up 12.3% year over year to $0.82 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.05.Total revenue for the reported quarter improved to $523.2 million from $498.3 million in the prior-year period due to modest organic growth at constant currency basis, led by solid insurance business. Revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $520 million. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) from continuing operations for the quarter improved 3.7% year over year to $254.1 million.Segmental PerformanceDecision Analytics segment’s revenues from continuing operations increased 4.2% year over year to $330.6 million and accounted for 63.2% of total revenue. Energy and Specialized Markets category revenues declined 0.7% year over year to $110.3 million, owing to end-market headwinds and lower revenues in environmental health and safety solutions.

Industry-standard insurance programs revenues were up 6.9% to $145.6 million, primarily attributable to growth in new solutions.AcquisitionsDuring the quarter, Verisk acquired seven premier aerial imagery firms to support its Geomni business. The strategic acquisitions are likely to create a proprietary database of property information derived from multi-tier, multi-spectral images in order to unlock a large addressable market. Consequently, Verisk aims to leverage its expertise in computer-vision-based imagery processing and large-scale data management to meet the increasing needs of property/casualty insurance with the required frequency, resolution and coverage across the U.S. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive to the company’s earnings in the near future.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAt the end of the quarter, Verisk had about $140.7 million in cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $2,276.6 million.

245,VRSK,"On Sep 5, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report).Growth DriversUsing advanced technologies to collect and analyze troves of data, Verisk draws on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions that are integrated into customer workflows. These help its customers to take informed decisions with greater precision, efficiency and discipline about various risks involved in the businesses. In order to create long-term value for its clients, the company has extended its scalable data and analytic solutions by steadily putting resources into overseas markets. The scalability of its products has further led to highly cash-generative businesses characterized by high net margins and relatively low capital intensity.Verisk aims at creating long-term value through organic growth and better returns on invested capital. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working with its customers to understand their evolving needs. Verisk recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years.At the same time, Verisk continues to extend its footprint in new markets, with healthy long-term growth potential, through targeted international expansion. The company recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire Sequel, a premier insurance and reinsurance software specialist based in London, for £250 million. The transaction is likely to close in third-quarter 2017, subject to the fulfilment of mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Since its inception in 1933, Sequel has carved a niche for itself in the insurance and reinsurance businesses with an integrated suite of software that provides full end-to-end management of the related services. The strategic acquisition will enable Verisk to strengthen its footprint in the U.K. and further expand its comprehensive offerings to the global complex commercial and specialty insurance industry. With unique software tools, Verisk is likely to gain a key insight of customer’s workflows, facilitating integrated global data analytics through a specialized end-to-end workflow solution. Consequently, the transaction is likely to be a great value addition for Verisk and is expected to be neutral to 2017 adjusted earnings per share while being accretive to 2018 adjusted earnings.HeadwindsVerisk is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and pose a threat to the company.The company is also vulnerable to high volatility related to continued end-market headwinds affecting its energy business and environmental health and safety solutions. Verisk has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date decline of 0.2% as against a gain of 20.9% for the latter.Moving ForwardNevertheless, we expect Verisk to witness higher revenues in the future and remain impressed by its focused growth initiatives.

248,VRSK,"Business information services firm Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after market close on Aug 1. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, Verisk beat earnings estimates twice, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.71%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the Second QuarterDuring the quarter, Verisk acquired MAKE, a leading research and advisory business specializing in wind power. Per the deal, MAKE became part of Verisk’s operating unit, Wood Mackenzie. This acquisition will enhance the company’s offerings to its existing clients and help it become the leading market analysis and advisory firm. The company expects this acquisition to be accretive in the quarter to be reported.Also, Verisk’s business arm, ISO signed a strategic alliance with IDP, Inc., for expanding the ISO Preferred Data Partnership program. Under the Preferred Data Partnership program, ISO accumulates and refines raw policy data straight from insurers. The collected data is used to form reports that are submitted to the regulatory authorities across the U.S. The two companies would thereby be converting the accumulated native data into valuable information and provide regulatory as well as statistical reports to the regulatory authorities, on behalf of the insurers (for both special data calls and conventional reporting requisites). This will help boost the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, a significant portion of the company’s revenues is generated from operations outside the U.S. With modest revenues coming from the U.K., Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. These undermine its long-term growth potential to some extent.Verisk’s business model is centered on large troves of data. Consequently, the company is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and jeopardize the fundamental existence of the company.Earnings WhispersDespite the inherent strengths, our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 77 cents. So, the difference – the Earnings ESP – is 0.00%. Verisk Analytics, Inc.
