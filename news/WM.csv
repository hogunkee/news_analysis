0,WM,"Monopoly: Calls to break up tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google have been increasing. But while the sentiment is understandable, the free market is far more likely to tame these giants without any government intervention.We can remember when everyone was promising that the internet would unleash competition by lowering barriers to entry and often by cutting out the middle man. But in some ways the opposite has happened, as three companies wound up controlling the lion's share of online advertising and commerce.That, in turn, has generated growing interest in breaking these companies up, or heavily regulating them as monopolies.This past week, for example, a new coalition called ""Freedom From Facebook"" launched a petition calling on the Federal Trade Commission to spin off Facebook (FB) subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into competing networks.""Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,"" the group says. ""It buys up or bankrupts potential competitors to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice.""Amazon (AMZN) is also coming under fire for its sheer size — it is on track to become the first company in history to reach $1 trillion in value.Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart, recently said that Congress should look into breaking up Amazon because it's ""destroying jobs, and it's destroying value in the (retail) sector,"" adding for good measure that ""it's anti-competitive, it's predatory, and it's not right.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew York University professor Scott Galloway argues that breaking up these and other big tech firms ""could unleash another 20 to 30 years of unbelievable innovation and shareholder growth.""Calls to regulate and break up big companies are not new. In the 1990s, we heard the same claims made about Microsoft. It was too big and powerful and was hampering innovation, and the only solution was to break it up.History shows there's a better, faster, more efficient and more direct way to deal with companies that are ""too big."" Let the free market work. Time and again, giants of industry get toppled not by government regulators, but by new disruptive competitors.Sears in its heyday, for example, was essentially a combination of Walmart (WMT) and Amazon. It had a massive retail presence, and a massive mail order catalog (the internet of the day) business. Today it is barely breathing.The government never did break Microsoft up. But new competitors like Google (GOOGL) and Apple (APPL) fundamentally reshaped the marketplace in ways that severely hampered it.Another way to look at it is this: Of the 500 companies that made the Fortune 500 list in 1955, only 53 remain on that list, notes economist Mark Perry.Only two of the companies that ranked in the top 10 in 1955 are still on the list. And of the top 10 companies today, four didn't even exist in 1955.It's a virtual certainty that decades from now, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and others will have gone the way of Microsoft or IBM or Sears or Zenith Electronics or Kodak or Bethlehem Steel.

9,WM,"Wal-Mart (WMT) said it will raise its starting wage to $11 an hour as part of an initial plan to ""share in tax savings"" with 1 million employees.X The retail giant said the wage hike will cost it $300 million in the coming fiscal year, beyond its already-planned wage increases. Wal-Mart also said it will spend another $400 million in the current year ending Jan. 31 on one-time bonuses ranging from $200 to $1,000 based on length of service.As the nation's largest private employer, Wal-Mart has a big influence on working-class wages, so its pay hike could result in increases for many other workers in modest-pay industries.Shares of Wal-Mart fell 1 cent to 99.66 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart has been flirting with a 100.23 flat-base buy point, but the stock's relative strength line has been lagging while the major averages continue to climb.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index all were up about 0.2%-0.3% in the early going after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered their first loss of 2018 on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Waste Management (WM) joined the parade of companies providing bonuses or wage hikes on the heels of tax cuts, saying up to 34,000 employees would get a $2,000 bonus. With Wal-Mart's moves, companies are crediting the tax cuts for providing additional pay to more than 2 million workers.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); and Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.In addition, utilities are implementing modest cuts to the power bills of millions of customers.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Retail-Major Discount Chains industry group, based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how other retailers stack up. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked No. 41 of 197 industry groups based on stock performance.  As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Wal-Mart also announced additional benefits for full-time hourly associates, including 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave, as well as adoption assistance of $5,000.Wal-Mart's wage hike follows one by Target (TGT), which increased its minimum wage to $11 an hour starting last October. At the same time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020.In January 2016, Wal-Mart said it would hike its minimum wage for nearly all employees to $10 an hour, but it kept its starting wage at $9 an hour for employees in their first six months.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Here Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

41,WM,"Many U.S. diversified ETFs rose Wednesday as stocks rallied on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's dovish comments before Congress.Here are two large-cap plays that staged a rebound off their 50-day moving average lines, setting up a buy opportunity.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), which launched in May 2011, has attracted $6.7 billion in assets. After ranking the S&P 500 companies each quarter by their volatility, the fund invests in the 100 least volatile stocks.SPLV has slightly underperformed the  S&P 500 this year through July 11 with an 8.2% return vs. the benchmark index's 9.5% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. Its three-year average annual return of 10.4% outpaces the S&P 500's 9.5%, while its five-year return of 12.8% lags the S&P 500's 15%.The ETF bounced back above its 50-day line Wednesday, setting the stage for potential investors. The ideal buy point is as close to the support line as possible. Shares rose nearly 5% in one month from the last pullback to the 50-day line in May.The ETF's four biggest sector weightings as of July 11 were industrials with 20%, financial services with 18%, utilities with 16%, and consumer defensive with 14%. Top names included 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Waste Management (WM).SPLV carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX) also rebounded off its 50-day line. The $9.2 billion fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index, turns eight in November.Technology accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of July 10, at nearly 20%, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) among its top holdings. Financial services followed at 16%, health care at 14%, consumer cyclical at 11.5%, and industrials at 11%.SCHX's performance has been pretty closely aligned with the S&P 500. Its YTD gain vs. the benchmark index is 9.6% to 9.5%, over three years is 9.3% to 9.5%, and over five years is 14.9% to 15%. The ETF's expense ratio is 0.03%.Wednesday's picks, which also featured two large-cap ETFs, scored gap-up gains. Vanguard Large-Cap (VV) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) each rose nearly 1%. Both remain in buy range from the 50-day line.Going back to the June 17 picks, KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) rose more than 7% in two weeks after rebounding off its 10-week line. It made one more pullback to the line after that and is up 3% from the later bounce. KraneShares on July 10 announced that China International Capital Corp. agreed to take a 50.1% stake in Krane Funds Advisors.RELATED:Chance To Own These 4 Top Tech Stocks And Much, Much More?Here Are 4 Big Caps That Raise Their Dividend Every Year, And Are Beating The S&P 500

44,WM,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

48,WM,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.

50,WM,"Dividend payers aren't just providing income, they are also providing breakouts from bases.General Mills (GIS) popped 2% Thursday, closing just above a 59.97 buy point. Volume was lower than average, however. The company has an annualized dividend yield of 3%.The cereal maker does a lot more than cereal now, with its ready to eat (RTE) cereal category accounting for just 20% of net sales in 2015.General Mills just presented at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference on Feb. 16, where one of the areas of growth mentioned was the away-from-home market.

Junior had to stir vats of soap for 10 hours a day.After a year of that mind-numbing drudgery, Junior wanted out and impressed his dad enough to move up and become a traveling salesman. The job came complete with a horse-drawn covered wagon to take him across Pennsylvania, New York and New England.At age 30, he was doing the same thing and had little savings. And now he was married with a family, so he needed more money.Wrigley had finally had enough by 1891 and went out on his own — to Chicago. He had only $32 in his pocket, but he was armed with a check from his uncle for $5,000 (worth about $132,000 now) to start a new business.The result was Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., which would become the chewing-gum concern. Initially it was an independent sales-rep business that sold products.""Wrigley would contract himself out to companies who wanted him to sell their goods,"" Aaseng wrote. ""The first product he sold was his father's soap.""In an effort to build more profit into a box of his father's mineral scouring soap for his retailers, Wrigley raised the price.How to make it attractive to customers? Add giveaways.""Everyone likes something extra for nothing,"" he said.The first product premium he found to give away with boxes of soap was umbrellas, a large stock of which he'd secured at a favorable price. Next, he moved on to baking soda, but when it proved more popular than the soap, he switched to selling that.The Top TreatThen he found chewing gum to give away with the baking powder.When the chewing gum became the in-demand item, Wrigley had found his calling.First he sold gum brands from another company. Then he created his own flavors and product. By 1893, he'd developed Wrigley's Spearmint and Juicy Fruit gum while jettisoning his other products. He personally promoted and sold his product, constantly spending nights on the road that year.His big sales pitch was offering cash registers and coffee makers to merchants who bought lots of gum.Seeing that the confection was an impulse buy, he created display cases and made sure stores placed them near cash registers.Wrigley methodically carved out a niche for his company. Then the Wall Street crash of 1907 nearly sent his company into bankruptcy.He didn't panic. He upped the ante. Aaseng quoted an associate: ""I've never seen Mr. Wrigley flustered; I've never even seen him act worried. He just seems to approach everything in an easy, uncomplicated way.""Wrigley quickly launched a massive advertising campaign, funded by a loan of $250,000 (worth $6.4 million now) on which he risked everything. Due to the country's financial shakes, he was able to jump on slashed ad rates. ""Wrigley was one of those people who refused to be stopped by failure,"" Aaseng said. ""Because he was not afraid to fail, he was able to take risks that would have daunted others.""The Ad ManCalled the ""father of modern advertising"" by many, Wrigley rode this philosophy: ""Tell 'em quick and tell 'em often.""""Wrigley's relentless barrage of ads, combined with his competitors' silence as they sat cautiously on the sidelines, gave the nation the impression that there was only one major national manufacturer of gum,"" Aaseng wrote.Wrigley's risk turned his company's annual sales from $170,000 to more than $3 million (or $78 million today's money) in roughly one year. By 1910, Wrigley's Spearmint and Juicy Fruit were the nation's best-selling gum products.Between the founding of his company and his 1932 death, Wrigley spent $100 million on advertising, more than any other single-product company, says Aaseng's book.But the Wrigley boom had to do with more than marketing.""Even in a little thing like a stick of gum, quality is important,"" he said, as quoted in ""William Wrigley Jr."" by Joanne Mattern.Not one to rest on laurels, Wrigley in 1914 created Doublemint, a wildly successful gum that became memorable through decades of using twins in its ad campaigns.He found new methods to get his chewing gum into customers' hands. In 1915 and 1919, he took advantage of the new medium of the telephone by sending a free product sample to everyone listed in directories across the nation. Those users rose from 1.5 million to 7 million through the end of the decade.""Wrigley's hard work had paid off,"" Mattern said. ""He had become the biggest gum manufacturer in the world.""Wrigley also put money back into his workforce, becoming a pioneer in giving weekends off and offering employees free medical care and life insurance.Those entering Wrigley's office saw a maxim displayed prominently: ""Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.""

107,WM,"These days it's tougher to find a competitive yield without taking on too much risk. Waste collectors Waste Management (WM) and Republic Services (RSG) carry above-market yields and offer lower volatility.Waste Management currently pays 36.5 cents a share each quarter or $1.46 on an annual basis. It yields about 3.3%, compared to 2.41% for the S&P 500. The company has steadily increased its shareholder dividend over the years. Waste Management's dividend has nearly doubled since 2004.Republic Services pays stockholders 26 cents a share each quarter or $1.04 annually. The company last bumped up its dividend by 11% to the current rate in July. The current yield is 3%. The firm's dividend has sharply increased from just 4 cents a share about 10 years ago.Both are among the highest-yielding stocks in IBD's Pollution-Control group. Waste Management has the second highest, while Republic Services has the third-best yield.Both stocks have betas below 1, meaning they have fewer ups and downs than a general market index such as the S&P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Revenue growth at both companies accelerated in recent quarters. Waste Management's sales growth has picked up to 5% in Q3 from 1% in Q1, helped by, in part, higher fuel surcharges and higher collection yields. Republic Services' top-line growth climbed to 6% in the third quarter, lifted by higher yields and fees. That marked its biggest gain in years. Sales edged up 1% in Q1 and 2% in Q2.Waste Management has pulled back into buying range from a 43.69 buy point in a flat base. It retreated in some heavy volume, which is not ideal. But the stock went through a solid period of accumulation from late October to late November.Republic Services has shaped a saucer-with-handle-like base with a 35.39 buy point.

111,WM,"Clean Harbors, Inc.’s (CLH  -  Free Report) shares have lost 11.5% compared with its industry’s loss of 2.5%, in the past three months. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeFuel Price FluctuationsVolatility in fuel prices and new policies are rapidly transforming the American energy sector, while escalating tensions in the Middle East are clouding the global oil picture. The company’s exploration, drilling activity and production are largely dependent upon the operation of oil rigs, as well as global and North American oil prices. Volatility in oil prices and future price uncertainties have resulted in lower activity levels that are negatively impacting the business' results.Seasonal FluctuationsClean Harbors’ demand cycle is highly dependent on the changing seasons. The company witnesses a decreasing demand for environmental services in the first quarter owing to frigid weather, mainly in the Northern and Midwestern United States, and Canada. As a result, reduction in volumes of waste and higher operating costs associated with functioning in sub-zero temperatures with high levels of snowfall, impair the smooth functioning of the business.Additionally, certain services’ demand also varies with their easy accessibility, depending on the seasons. The seasonal variations reduce the predictability of income and weighs on the company’s earnings.Downward Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankThe expected dismal performance in the first quarter seems to a major reason behind the price plunge and is further aggravated by downward estimate revisions.  Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings stayed flat at a loss of 14 cents per share, over the past 60 days, the same for 2018 decreased 22%.The downward estimate revisions along with a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflect pessimism over prospects of Clean Harbors.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryClean Harbors has a disappointing earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 35.7%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Waste Management (WM  -  Free Report), US Ecology (ECOL  -  Free Report) and Kforce (KFRC  -  Free Report).

114,WM,"The Waste Management industry mainly deals with all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry and major services include waste collection, waste treatment and disposal, and remediation.The industry is highly dependent on industrial, commercial and construction business activities. Growth in these sectors results in higher waste production, thereby increasing demand for industry services. The waste management industry is thus firmly tied to the health of the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable.A rise in GDP, an improving employment scenario, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities are currently benefiting from all-round strength in the economy. The Trump administration’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations, are additional tailwinds.Furthermore, increasing demand for renewable energy and solid waste recycling has opened up revenue generation opportunities for this industry.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Waste Removal Services stock — Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) and Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report).

115,WM,"The economic backdrop exhibits signs of improvement with the rise in GDP, a better employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum gained by oil prices.  The outlook for business services sector moves in line with the broader economy. Significantly, the business-friendly orientation of the current administration is widely expected to give the U.S. economy a nudge of growth.  The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market. Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies, helping them benefit from operating efficiencies. Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies -- for example, payroll processing, staffing, marketing/advertising and information technology, to name some of the major areas. Gradual improvement in interest rate environment points toward improving economic conditions. The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.The Fed also provided an optimistic employment outlook. Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to be 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019 and 4% in 2020.President Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35%. This move is likely to act as an impetus. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters. GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2.4% in 2018 and 2019, better than 2.3% in 2017. This favorable outlook for the U.S. economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well. No doubt the Zacks Business Services sector has been a strong performer, gaining 20.9% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 18.2% gain. The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability. Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, as well as improving competitive positioning. Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks. Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. Per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the sector’s total revenue. Stand-Alone Zacks Sector: Favorable Given the group’s unique nature, Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P’s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the ‘Industrials’ sector). Notably, with about 3.8% of total market capitalization, the sector generated 3.1% of the total S&P 500 income in 2017. This industry offers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry. Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium (M-level) and 265 industries at the expanded (X-level). We rank all 265 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page. We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.) Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks – the core of our Industry Rank – has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have eight X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services. Staffing at #59, Business Information Services at #65, Auction/Valuation Services at #68, Waste Removal at #88 and Outsourcing at #108 all fall in the top half.Financial Transaction Services at #148, Business Services at #171 and Consulting at #234 are the industries that fall in the bottom half.Our top picks from the Outsourcing industries are ExlService Holdings, Inc. (EXLS  -  Free Report) and The Brink's Co. (BCO  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (HSII  -  Free Report), On Assignment, Inc. (ASGN  -  Free Report)  and Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are our top picks from the Staffing industry.

(SPGI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, are our favorites from the Business Information Services. A Zacks #1 Ranked player, Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) is our top pick from Auction/Valuation Services. US Ecology, Inc. (ECOL  -  Free Report) and Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) are #2 Ranked player and our favorite from the Waste Removal industry.Valuation of the SectorThe valuation of the business service sector seems attractive relative to its own history as well as the broader S&P 500 index.The Zacks Business Service sector is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.2X. Over the last five years, the sector has traded as low as 9.2X and as high as 11.2X with a median of 10X. In other words, the sector is currently trading at the high end of its five-year range and higher than median on a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. On a forward 12-month EPS basis, the sector trades at 21.8X, comparing with the five-year range of 19.1X and 21.8X and a median of 20.3X. In other words, the sector is trading toward the high end of its five-year forward 12-month P/E range as well as its median. The sector is trading at a discount to the S&P 500 index on the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. The sector modestly underperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. While the sector has gained 21.3%, the index has rallied 23.2%.  Earnings Outlook Companies have already started reporting fourth-quarter earnings. While earnings are expected to be improving 5.4%, revenues will grow 4.8%. Both compare unfavorably with the S&P 500 index. For 2017, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 9.4% on 3.7% revenue growth compared with the S&P 500 index’s earnings growth of 7.5% on back of 5.2% top-line growth.   For 2018, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 12% on 6.4% revenue growth. This compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s expected earnings increase of 13.7% but favorably with 5.1% higher revenues from 2017.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500. The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500 index. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

116,WM,"The U.S. equity markets welcomed 2018 on a strong note as the Dow broke the historic milestone of 25,000 for the first time, while other leading benchmark indices scaled record highs on solid economic data across the globe. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on the corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.   As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Houston, TX, Waste Management is the largest provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America.

119,WM,"On Dec 4, we issued an updated research report on leading comprehensive waste management services provider, Waste Management Inc.

At the same time, the company aims to improve customer retention by providing better services and higher value solutions.

Such a bullish outlook raises investor confidence in the stock.With diligent execution of operational plans, the stock has outperformed the industry year to date with an average return of 15.4% compared with 12.1% gain for the latter.However, stringent government regulations are likely to contract margins as compliance with such regulations increases operating costs for the company. In order to develop or operate a landfill or any waste management unit, facility permits and other governmental approvals are necessary. These permits and approvals are often difficult to obtain, are time consuming and costly and could restrict its operations. All these are likely to impact the company’s profitability in the long term.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the solid growth prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

120,WM,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on Nov 14. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.77%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of A.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, indicating less chances of beating estimates.

122,WM,"Robert Half International, Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global staffing firm will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company posted an average earnings surprise of 0.23% in the trailing four quarters.A glimpse of Robert Half’s stock performance shows that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized Staffing Firms industry and the broader Business Services sector for the last six months. The stock dipped 0.4% against the above mentioned industry’s growth of 10.8% and sector’s improvement of 8.7%. Notably, the industry is part of the top 18% of the Zacks Classified industries (49 out of the 256), while the broader sector is placed at bottom 25% of the Zacks Classified sectors (12 out of 16).Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share for the second quarter and $2.66 per share for 2017 reflects a year-over-year decrease of 7.9% and 0.2%, respectively. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.31 billion for the said quarter, down 2.4% from the year-ago period. For 2017, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.22 billion, down 0.6% year over year.Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Robert Half International Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Halfis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESPfor this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Robert Half has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 65 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Factors Influencing the QuarterRobert Half is the world's largest specialized provider of temporary and permanent personnel in the fields of accounting and finance. Robert Half's total revenue has been improving on the back of higher demand for its professional staffing and consulting services. The company’s international operations also improved due to higher demand for staffing and consulting services.Moreover, Protiviti is also adding to the year-over-year revenue gains, which seem to be quite encouraging. Further, Protiviti has an impressive growth outlook due to a robust regulatory environment as well as increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures.However, lower margins, currency fluctuations and rising health care costs remain the major concerns for Robert Half. In fact, lower margins, especially at Protiviti, are expected to take a toll on Robert Half’s profits.We note that the company’s sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters due to a decline in the U.S. staffing revenues. Currency headwinds are also denting sales.Nevertheless, Robert Half remains confident of performing well given the solid labor market and stable economic landscape. Also, it expects reduction in the hiring cycle and in turn boosting the company’s profitability. Further, Protiviti is enhancing its practice areas owing to digital expansion and data security measures.Robert Half issued its earnings and sales guidance for second-quarter 2017. The company expects revenues in the range of $1.275–$1.335 billion for the said quarter. In addition, it expects earnings in the range of 61–67 cents per share.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesStocks in the business services sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank, and are therefore worth considering include:S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +2.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.

131,WM,"On Mar 05, we updated the research report on waste management firm, Clean Harbors, Inc. (CLH  -  Free Report).The company is currently focused on enhancing its operating margins through better pricing policies, improving revenue mix, increasing efficiencies and capitalizing on growth initiatives, which are likely to aid its long-term growth potential. It is also expanding its existing services portfolio, especially in non-disposal services, with a view to generate incremental revenues in the future. Healthy Growth DynamicsIn fourth-quarter 2017, Clean Harbors completed the acquisition of Veolia North America’s U.S. Industrial Cleaning Services Division for $120 million in an all-cash transaction, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. For 2017, the acquired company generated revenues of approximately $210 million. It employs roughly 1,300 employees and maintains an extensive fleet of vehicles and equipment at more than 60 operating locations across the United States.The acquisition is likely to deliver numerous benefits to Clean Harbors’ customers, shareholders and industrial services employees. Likewise, this gives a scope for significant scale and industrial service capabilities while more than doubling the size of its existing U.S. Industrial Services business. The acquired business’ operational footprint, particularly its strong presence in the Midwest, complements Clean Harbors’ existing network of locations. The addition of this business will create new cross-selling opportunities and drive incremental volumes into Clean Harbors’ waste disposal network. This transaction is expected to enhance Clean Harbors’ long-term shareholder’s value and lead to healthy return on investments in 2018 and after.Clean Harbors is focusing on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through enhanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management. The company has a competitive advantage around the treatment, storage and disposal facilities.In addition, Clean Harbors continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payments and strategic acquisitions. The company has also historically promulgated a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position. The stock has, however, underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date loss of 8.9% compared with a 2.3% decline for the latter. Moving Forward  Clean Harbors’ Tech Services is expected to deliver higher profitability due to its new incinerator’s second full year of operation and the strength of the industrial economy, particularly the expansion in the chemical space. Its Safety-Kleen is on track for another solid year of profitable growth. The addition of Veolia’s U.S. industrial cleaning business is likely to enable the company’s industrial team to gain meaningful traction.Also, the improving energy markets bode well for the company in multiple areas. Hence, we remain encouraged with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report), Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN  -  Free Report) and Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

138,WM,"Premier waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock beat estimates thrice with an average positive surprise of 3.58%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderRepublic Services has significantly expanded its product offerings in the e-commerce platform to address the evolving needs of the customers. This low-cost sales channel is likely to witness higher earnings in the quarter. In addition, the company improved the capabilities and functionality of the customer portal and mobile app with the enrolment of over 1.8 million customers. These value-driven interactive features are likely to lead to incremental orders and higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.At the same time, Republic Services is focusing on increasing operational efficiency by converting its fleet to compressed natural gas collection vehicles and modifying rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will reduce costs and improve profitability. The company is realigning its field support functions by combining two organizational layers. It expects these initiatives to contribute approximately $25 million of annual cost savings from 2018. As part of the realignment program, the company centralized the management structure for recycling operations. The new organizational structure is likely to ensure a clear ownership for the recycling and processing market vertical. Republic Services is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy ROI (return on investments).Furthermore, Republic Services continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payment, repurchasing shares and strategic acquisitions. Over the years, the company has returned significant cash to its shareholders as dividends or share repurchases. In addition, it also historically promulgated a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position.However, margin pressure remains a bottleneck for the company. Margins are expected to remain constrained in the impending quarter as Republic Services has more exposure to Collection services and less to Disposal services. Typically, the Disposal services generate the highest margins and the Collection services generate the lowest. The company’s performance is also likely to be hurt by protracted weakness in special waste, industrial volumes and tight municipal budgets. In addition, increased competitive pressure remains a cause of concern for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Republic Services is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at 59 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Republic Services, Inc.

139,WM,"Diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Amphenol surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Key Factors in the QuarterAmphenol’s top-line growth is expected to benefit from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive industrial, mobile networks and military markets. The diversification in end markets with a consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle is likely to help the company achieve solid top-line growth.Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for Amphenol.In order to fuel further growth, Amphenol aims to make acquisitions on a global basis in the high-growth segments that have complementary capabilities from a product, customer and/or geographic standpoint. Amphenol also expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team augur well for the company. For the to-be-reported quarter, Amphenol expects adjusted earnings of 70–72 cents per share on revenues of $1.580–$1.620 billion. We expect the company to record year-over-year growth of 10.3% and 3.6% in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amphenol is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

145,WM,"Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 15. Last quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWaste Management is executing well its initiatives to refocus on the core business activities and instill price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. The company aims to focus on improving customer retention by providing better service and higher value solutions.Since its acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal in 2015, the company has extended its geographical footprint and emerged with a stronger financial profile. Waste Management has also acquired Keep It Clean, a local disposal firm, during the quarter. The company’s steady stream of accretive acquisitions is likely to drive earnings. It has also reported better-than-expected revenues in the trailing six quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Waste Management’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,565 million, slightly higher than reported revenues of $3,460 million in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company's successful cost-reduction initiatives have helped it in accomplishing remarkable gross margin expansion and EBITDA growth over the quarters. It is undertaking several steps to further boost its margins, which are likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company expects volumes to be down due to lower national counts as it strives for improved margin growth and pricing. The pricing environment also remains challenging and highly competitive due to aggressive bidding by smaller competitors. Waste Management needs to improve margins on the recycling side through adjustment of rebates to reflect lower pricing and also needs to improve the quality of inbound material to increase profitability. Decline in average recycling commodity prices and recycling volumes also remain headwinds.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waste Management is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.
