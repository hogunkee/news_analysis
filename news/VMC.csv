4,VMC,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) stock rose Tuesday after the building supplies giant outperformed earnings expectations, lifting other stocks in the sector.X The sand, granite, limestone, and gravel merchant reported earnings per share of $1.88, up 21% vs. a year earlier. That crushed Wall Street estimates by 46 cents according to Zacks Investment Research. Martin Marietta Materials sales rose 2.5% vs. a year earlier to $911 million, but that failed to meet expectations for $913 million.The fourth-quarter results included a one-time, noncash benefit of $258.1 million related to the Trump administration's tax reform.Martin Marietta rose 2.6% to 218.35 on the stock market today, near session lows after hitting 229.66 intraday. The stock did close above its 200-day moving average but ended just below its 50-day after vaulting above that key level. The stock has a composite rating of 55, however its EPS rating of 84 is more impressive. The firm is ranked third in the Building-Cement, Concrete And Aggregates Group, which is led by Loma Negra (LOMA).Martin Marietta's performance was hit by delays in Texas Department of Transportation projects and a slow down in railroad ballast shipments. In addition abnormally wet weather conditions, the Hurricane Matthew and a slower energy-related marketplace.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.However the firm, which has a $14 billion market cap, has improved cost management and operational efficiency.For 2018 it expects full-year revenue of $4.16 billion to $4.36 billion, above Wall Street forecasts for $4.078 billion.Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, was bullish.""Our ability to post record results despite these external factors, among them extraordinary weather events, contractor labor constraints, and a slower-than-expected pace of public contract lettings, validates the successful execution of our strategic plan and underpins our optimism for a steady and extended cyclical recovery as we begin 2018,"" Nye said.

5,VMC,"The federal deficit is getting so unwieldy that not even fake math can make it disappear.The White House's budget proposal released Monday projects a $984 billion deficit in 2019 under President Trump's preferred policies, nearly double its $526 billion projection a year ago. For the full 10-year budget window, cumulative deficits are now seen totaling $7.1 trillion, well more than double last year's projection that magically ended in a budget surplus by 2027.Even those upwardly revised totals may be too optimistic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget last week said that the new budget deal will raise the 2019 deficit to $1.2 trillion. Assuming that individual tax cuts don't phase out and programmatic spending stays on the same trajectory, that would put the U.S. on track to run up deficits of roughly $15 trillion over the coming decade.""The country is facing a massive fiscal challenge, and the President's budget doesn't own up to these realities and fails to call for a suite of credible policies that would help change course. The budget has too many gimmicks, exaggerated savings, and rosy assumptions,"" Maya MacGuineas, president of the committee, said in a written statement. ""Most troubling, it doesn't make the credible hard choices necessary to help bring the debt back to more manageable levels.""She did say, however, that ""the budget does include a number of thoughtful and serious policies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Medicare program — along with a number of other smart policies to reduce government spending. We encourage the administration to pursue these ideas.""Yet Wall Street may find some good news in President Trump's budget proposal, as traders now are worried about too much fiscal stimulus and trillion-dollar deficits: Trump's big infrastructure funding plan looks like a nonstarter for Democrats and is likely a bridge to nowhere.""This is not a real infrastructure plan — it's simply another scam, an attempt by this administration to privatize critical government functions, and create windfalls for their buddies on Wall Street,"" Rep. Peter DeFazio, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, said Sunday in the Democratic weekly address.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied for a second day on Monday, with the major indexes all up at least 1.2% at midday.The emergence of better wage growth and the explosion of the federal deficit, even as the Federal Reserve gradually reverses government bond purchases made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, had sent the 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high in a wake-up call for stock market investors.The White House budget calls for a $1.5 trillion boost to infrastructure spending, but only $200 billion of that would come from the federal government, with state and local governments and private investors ponying up the rest in a competition to secure federal grants. What makes it an especially hard sell for Democrats is that the $200 billion federal contribution would come from cost savings in the rest of the budget, including the Department of Transportation spending plan.After last week's budget deal that will hike deficits by $320 billion over two years, and after passing tax cuts that are expected to add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade, the White House is signaling that it's drawing a line on further fiscal laxity — just in time for the infrastructure debate. The new budget plan calls for $3 trillion in savings, including discretionary domestic program cuts of 2% a year after 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The political calculation for Democrats is whether they're better off settling for less than half a loaf and giving the White House a victory, or campaigning on a much bigger building plan and blaming the GOP for prioritizing corporate tax cuts over infrastructure. There's little doubt that the more combative approach will win out in this critical election year.The White House said it isn't making a take-it-or-leave-it offer, so it's possible Trump will try to make a deal Democrats can't refuse, but it's not clear if the rest of the GOP would be willing to further increase the deficit.Investors seem to have reined in expectations for Trump's infrastructure push. Shares of big cement maker Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which reports earnings on Tuesday morning, were off 0.8% on the stock market today.After missing out on 2017's big stock market gains, Martin and Vulcan Materials (VMC) both cleared buy points as the stock market was peaking in late January, but both stocks sunk back below their 200-day moving averages and are basically back where they were in the week Trump was elected. IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is ranked a lowly 144 out of 197 industry groups based on stock-price performance and momentum.Still, shares of Vulcan rose 1.35% on Monday, while Summit Materials (SUM) gained 1% and Eagle Materials (EXP) 1.2%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

6,VMC,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade. The move technically placed the stock in a buy range on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. But volume would need to kick in over the next day or so in order to confirm the buying opportunity.At the bottom of the IBD 50 list, MiMedx Group (MDXG) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) each shed about 5%.Other Important Market News For Wednesday:Bring Your Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Report: Action PlanBiggest U.S. Homebuilder Hits Resistance, Despite 40% Earnings GainHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

7,VMC,"President Trump will bask in the glow of a strong economy, record stock market and the coming boost to take-home pay from tax cuts, as he delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday night.X But what investors really want to hear about are the agenda items that could kick the economy into still-higher gear, undercut its momentum or alter the fortunes of various industry groups. Steel tariffs, infrastructure funding, dealmaking over immigration to avoid a government shutdown, and the future of Nafta all could feature in Tuesday's speech.Ahead of the speech — in which Trump could announce whether he'll impose new restrictions on steel imports — steel stocks were among the better-performing groups on the stock market today, though most of the early gains faded. Steel Dynamics (STLD) rose 0.1%, U.S. Steel (X) 0.5% and AK Steel (AKS) 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite traded modestly lower.The theme of Trump's speech is a ""safe, strong and proud America,"" so it wouldn't be surprising for him to preach a hard line on trade disputes. The real question is whether he'll announce new trade measures, double-down on his threat to walk away from Nafta, or whether he'll be satisfied to tout his recent actions slapping tariffs on solar cells and big washing machines.The Commerce Department on Jan. 11 announced that it has completed its national security investigation into the impact of steel mill product imports, giving President Trump 90 days to decide whether to impose any remedies. CNBC reported last week that Commerce recommended a wide range of options to deal with aluminum and steel dumping in the U.S., including potentially higher tariffs.Yet Monday's stock gains may have been fueled by an announcement from AK Steel that it was hiking current spot-market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $30 per ton — its second announced price hike this year.""Domestic steel inventory levels have moderated,"" Steel Dynamics CEO Mark Millett said last week in an earnings statement. ""World steel demand and pricing have structurally improved and domestic steel demand remains healthy.""IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta Materials is ranked No. 4 by IBD in the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Cement makers have been laggards, ranked No. 135 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The steel industry has tried to keep pressure on the White House to come to its aid, but given the improving fundamentals, it's not clear how far Trump will want to go in risking what could be a messy trade dispute and likely hike prices for domestic steel customers.Meanwhile, the latest round of Nafta negotiations appears to be ending on a concerning note, with Reuters reporting that the countries won't issue a joint statement about the path forward for settling their differences. Wall Street remains concerned that Trump could start a six-month clock to a unilateral withdrawal from the trading pact, but Trump may secretly be satisfied with the status quo. We'll probably have a better idea after Tuesday night.The other two big agenda items revolve around how Trump will work Democrats, both on immigration and infrastructure, since there's not much he can do with the slimmest of majorities in the Senate.On infrastructure, the White House has reportedly embraced a strategy to lure more than $1 trillion in private, state and local funding with the hook of $200 billion in federal funds. Prospects for such a deal passing Congress appear slim, though, in part because Democrats want more federal funding, and Republicans are expected to demand spending cuts to offset any new spending commitments.Yet IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is finally showing signs of life after mostly missing out on 2017's big stock market gains. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) both cleared buy points in the past week and remain within the 5% chase zone. Martin Marietta shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, while Vulcan Materials was off 1.7%.An unexpected boost to federal infrastructure spending would be gravy on top of lower corporate tax rates and a strengthening economy, so investors will be listening to see if Trump offers a deal Democrats can't refuse.As long as Trump doesn't pull the plug on Nafta, and it seems unlikely that he will, then the clearest risk to economy and stock market comes from the potential for a prolonged government shutdown. While Democrats backed down after a 3-day shutdown last week, the reprieve was only temporary, with government funding extended through Feb. 8.Trump's words on Tuesday about what kind of immigration changes he'll demand in exchange for preserving legal status for Dreamers, which is set to lapse starting March 5, will set the tone for the negotiation ahead, but the signals so far look ominous. Democrats denounced the White House's proposal last week to end family unification immigration, also known as chain migration, beyond spouses and children.The key unknowns are whether there are 41 Democrats who will refuse to take ""no"" for an answer when it comes to Dreamers and whether Trump will give them any deal they'll accept. The potential for politics to drag down the economy seems real — especially because the government is set to hit its borrowing limit in late March, raising the risk of a debt default.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Will The Trump Tax Cuts Make Wages, Growth Sizzle?

8,VMC,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

11,VMC,"U.S. stock indexes retreated midday Tuesday, despite optimism in a small business gauge and strength in the concrete group.X The Dow Jones industrial average stepped down 0.4%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq dipped less than 0.1%, but the small-cap Russell 2000 faded 0.2%.Volume fell on both major exchanges in the stock market today compared with the same time Monday.The optimism gauge of the National Federation of Independent Business rose to 106.9 in January, topping the consensus view for 105.5. The gauge draws attention because small businesses are responsible for most job creation.Earlier this month, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed to 56.7 in February, a 13-year high. Readings above 50 reflect optimism. Readings below 50 point to pessimism.In the Russell 2000, the day's losers included upscale hamburger chain Shake Shack (SHAK), down 3.5% in twice its usual volume; and Hertz Global (HTZ), off 4% in heavy volume.Shake Shack's stock has dropped in 10 of the past 13 sessions, not including Tuesday. The small-cap company will report Q4 and full-year 2017 results Thursday after the close. The Street expects 2017 earnings to drop 30% vs. the previous year. Q4 earnings set for a 60% drop, according to analysts.Small caps doing well midday Tuesday included RingCentral (RNG), which gapped up 9% on a 133% surge in Q4 earnings, topping views by almost 17%. Full-year 2017 earnings soared 122%.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an exchange-traded fund that reflects the IBD 50, was just above flat but headed for a third consecutive daily gain.In the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, Caterpillar (CAT) led with a 1.3% gain. Cat is trying to retake its 50-day line, which the stock lost Feb. 5 as the market crumbled.Among cement stocks, strength was emerging. Martin Marietta (MLM) jumped 5%; U.S. Concrete (USCR), 3.5%; Vulcan Materials (VMC), 2.8%; and Eagle Materials (EXP), 1%. Volume was above average for all except Eagle Materials. On. Jan. 31, Eagle reported results for fiscal Q3 ended in December. Earnings missed the Street's consensus estimate by 40%.Martin Marietta reported Q4 earnings Tuesday. Adjusted earnings jumped 21%, according to William O'Neil + Co., a sister company of IBD. The 21% increase was impressive, considering the Street expected a 3% decline in earnings.Vulcan will report quarterly results Friday at 11 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, U.S. Concrete has not yet set a date, according to its website.President Trump announced his infrastructure plan Monday, a plan that could mean more demand for cement and aggregates.RELATED:Caterpillar's Machinery Sales Jump 34%Is Apple Entering A Post Supercycle Era?Know This Sell Rule: Living Under The 10-Week Line

13,VMC,"Stocks punched higher at Monday's open, launching a spirited rebound from what was the Dow's worst week in eight years.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened up 1.1%, with the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 ahead 0.9% each.The market last week slipped into a technical correction, down more than 10% from recent highs, as the Dow booked its worst weekly loss since February 2009. The S&P 500's drop was its largest since May 2010.  The last time the Nasdaq took this large a loss was at the end of January 2016.On global markets, China's markets were mixed as they prepared to head into their weeklong Lunar New Year holiday later this week. The Shanghai Composite jumped 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.2%. In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday.In Europe, stocks hammered out considerable gains in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX led with a 1.4% advance.A quiet day of economic news and a slow start to the week's earnings calendar leaves Monday's unveiling of President Trump's infrastructure in sharp focus. Trump has previously said he aims to leverage $200 billion in federal funds into a $1.5 trillion building program.Infrastructure stocks likely to move on the news could include a wide array of construction names and materials suppliers. Among the most pure-play infrastructure stocks are the big engineering names such as Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Mastec (MTZ) and Quanta Services (PWR), as well as aggregates suppliers including Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan (VMC) and Summit Materials (SUM).Oil and commodities could also factor into Monday's trade. Crude posted an early rebound, as U.S. benchmark oil jumped 1.2% to trade just below the $60 per barrel mark. Silver and copper both rose more than 1% in early action.IBD'S TAKE: A correcting market is not a time to buy growth stocks, but it is the perfect time to build a watch list of leading stocks, near buy points in valid bases. The market will eventually post a follow-through day and launch a fresh uptrend. When it does, you want to have your shopping list of well-vetted stocks ready to go.Nearly all 30 Dow components rose at the start of trade. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led, up 3%. The company received a price target increase to 46, from 33, and an upgrade to buy from neutral, from Instinet. RBC Capital raised the stock's price target to 44, from 40.American Express (AXP) advanced 1.7% after an upgrade to buy, from neutral, by Nomura.Earnings news stirred some action early Monday, as payment solutions provider First Data (FDC) bolted 4.7% higher after its fourth-quarter earnings met analysts' views, and revenue was slightly higher than expected. The stock took an 8% loss last week and broke support, killing a three-month basing effort.Restaurant Brands International (QSR) popped 6.9% following mixed fourth-quarter results. The owner of the Burger King and Tim Horton's chains as well as Popeye's, the company's smallest chain, reported a surprise 11% gain in revenue, and the company announced a $742 million deferred tax benefit.China-based Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) jumped 2.9% before the open, and ahead of its fourth-quarter report which is due after the close. The online retail leader has pulled back 13% from its Jan. 26 high, leaving its Relative Strength line a notch off its high.Other China-based names were also positive, with Weibo (WB), TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) all posted early gains near 2%. Sina and Weibo report earnings this week.Apple (AAPL) pounded out a 1.4% advance and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 2.3% gain.Computer tech services contractor CSRA (CSRA) spiked 31% after General Dynamics (GD) agreed to buy the Falls Church, Va., company in a $6.8 billion deal.  The deal allows General Dynamics to better tap a pending surge in federal upgrade of IT security and cloud-computing operations. General Dynamics was down 1%, and just below a 211.85 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.21st Century Fox (FOX) climbed 2.9% following news reports that Comcast (CMCSA) was contemplating a refreshed bid for the company's film and television assets. Fox accepted a $52.4 billion takeover bid from Walt Disney (DIS) in December, after rejecting Comcast's offer of more than $60 billion, on grounds that regulators would block the combination. Comcast shares rose 1.1%.Disney shares rose 1.5% after the company announced it was raising the admission price to its Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. Theme park revenues provided the bulwark gains that led to the company's fourth-quarter earning beat. Disney shares ended Friday down 9% below their Jan. 3 high, but still in a valid cup-with-handle base.Oracle (ORCL) climbed more than 1%, after announcing plans for 12 new massive data centers in a move to better compete with Amazon.com, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in the cloud-computing market.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowThese 5 Defense Stocks Stand Out In Market CorrectionThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Leads Rebound; Now Watch For This SignalThese 4 Dow Stocks Reclaimed Key Support In Tough MarketThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On Edge
"
14,VMC,"With the celebration over his tax-cut victory still in full swing, President Trump tweeted last week that his big infrastructure plans are coming up next on the agenda. Yet the chances of passing any major building program look slim, at best, now that the Trump tax cuts have tapped a key potential source of infrastructure funding and arguably maxed out the federal government's borrowing commitments.X To seal their $1.5 trillion tax-cut victory, Republicans had to take a $339 billion bite out of the overseas cash holdings of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and other U.S. multinationals.The final version of the tax legislation imposed a 15.5% tax on cash held overseas by those tech titans and other companies to avoid being taxed at the current 35% corporate rate, along with an 8% tax on illiquid assets such as real estate. Apple has $252 billion parked overseas, while Microsoft holds $128 billion and Alphabet $52 billion.The move, which taxed away $150 billion more from multinationals' foreign cash stashes than an initial Senate plan released one month earlier, took away the prime source of funds eyed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and considered by President Trump to fund a national infrastructure investment plan in the U.S.One sign that Wall Street may have low expectations for Trump's infrastructure push is that IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group ranks a lowly 171 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance trends. Shares of the group's heavyweights, Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), haven't made any headway since the week of Trump's election. Several midsize players, Eagle Materials (EXP), Summit Materials (SUM) and U.S. Concrete (USCR) fared better in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The tax legislation, which is expected to mark a generational turning point in fiscal policy as the federal government heads for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit by 2019, already has congressional Republicans talking about shifting their focus to cutting spending.That leaves little room for compromise with Democrats, who have pushed for far bigger increases in infrastructure spending than the GOP is prepared to consider and who are sure to fight any spending curbs as the byproduct of tax cuts. Expect a replay of the aftermath of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, when Democrats refused to consider any spending cuts unless upper-income tax cuts were repealed.At a time when the Federal Reserve is gradually reversing its financial-crisis era asset purchases by letting maturing mortgage and Treasury holdings run off the balance sheet, a burgeoning federal deficit could begin to put upward pressure on Treasury yields.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget figures that the tax cuts could end up increasing federal deficits by $2 trillion or more over a decade, assuming that individual tax cuts don't sunset after 2025. The Congressional Budget Office said earlier in 2017 that legislation boosting deficits by $2 trillion would contribute to a near doubling of debt as a share of the economy over 20 years, from 77% in 2017 to 150% by 2047.If there's a wild card for the economic outlook in 2018, it's fiscal policy. If a government shutdown can be avoided, then fiscal policy could provide an added boost to growth, thanks to emergency spending on rebuilding from the damaging hurricanes that hit at the end of last summer.Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander expects tax and fiscal policy to boost 2018 GDP by a half percentage point to 2.7%, but he sees potential for upside, if Republicans agree to Democratic demands to match an increase in military spending with additional outlays for domestic programs.Yet there's also a risk that Democrats will lay out demands that Republicans refuse to meet, including an extension of President Obama's program that deferred deportation and provided work authorization for so-called Dreamers. While a prolonged government shutdown might not provide a major hit to growth, it would create uncertainty about the path of tax and spending policy ahead, dampening the enthusiasm created by the tax cuts.RELATED:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

16,VMC,"CRH's (CRH) $3.5 billion deal to buy privately held Ash Grove Cement may be giving a boost Thursday to some moderate-size players that might benefit from further consolidation in the building materials industry.XNews of the CRH deal, which represents a big expansion of the Ireland-based company's U.S. capacity, sent shares 2.7% higher on the stock market today. Summit Materials (SUM) rose 2.1% to a new high, while U.S. Concrete (USCR) gained 1.1%.On Wednesday, shares of Eagle Materials (EXP) cleared a cup-with-handle base, cresting a buy point of 104.28, which is often a precursor of further near-term gains. Eagle Materials shares rose 0.2% to 105.29 on Thursday, staying in a buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: CRH is ranked No. 3 by IBD in the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out the pacesetters at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked just 126 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""fail"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.But bigger industry players didn't rally from the news of consolidation, with shares of Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) off 1% and 1.2%, respectively.The Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group initially surged after the November election, partly due to expectations that President Trump would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program. But the group has mostly lagged since then, with Summit being among the exceptions. Prospects for a big infrastructure bill remain uncertain.While Trump has been making deals with Democrats recently, potentially a positive sign for cooperation on infrastructure, efforts at ObamaCare repeal and tax reform are likely to keep infrastructure on the back burner for a while.RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

17,VMC,"Hurricane Harvey recovery hopes triggered a huge move by IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group, which surged 5.4%, Wednesday's best-performing industry by far.XWet weather helped sink second-quarter results for Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta (MLM), so the initial concern about Harvey may have been business delays hurting third-quarter results. But the devastation has been so severe that materials makers' longer-term outlook looks sure to be more demand and higher prices.On Wednesday, shares of Vulcan surged 4.6% on the stock market today. Martin Marietta leapt 5.4%, Eagle Materials (EXP) 6.6%. Summit Materials (SUM) 5.4%, clearing its 50-day line in volume, making it buyable.The biggest winner was U.S. Concrete (USCR), based in Euless, Texas, which vaulted 9.9% to 81.40. U.S. Concrete cleared a buy point at 80.55, but remained within the 5% range before a stock is extended and riskier to buy.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important for maximizing your chance of profiting from a stock. Here's a good place to start looking for leading stocks that may be primed for breakouts.Texas is huge for these companies. Eagle is based in Dallas. Citi analyst Scott Schrier noted in a Tuesday note that the Texas market makes up roughly 35% of business for Martin Marietta, 25% for Summit and 17% for Vulcan.It's far from clear just how much extra business Hurricane Harvey will create, but on site reports suggest the damage is extensive. On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that the Texas Department of Transportation received $25 million in federal funds to start rehabilitating the state's transportation network.""The historic flooding has downed traffic lights, damaged roadway signs and caused highway asphalt to buckle or, worse, be swept away in some areas,"" the governor's office said.RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

19,VMC,"U.S. stocks popped higher midday Wednesday, as cement and aggregate stocks rallied for a third straight day.XThe cement, wallboard and aggregates companies are expected to be part of the rebuilding effort in the wake of the storm damage in the Gulf region.The Nasdaq rallied 0.6% midday Wednesday, which if it holds would be the best gain since Aug. 22, when IBD changed its market outlook from uptrend under pressure to confirmed uptrend. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, but the Dow Jones industrial average was flat. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.4%.Volume in the stock market today was below average, diluting some of the bullish mood. Bulls prefer to see a price rebound come in rising volume.The cement stock group jumped 4% Wednesday after gains of 1% and 2% in the previous two sessions. Within the group, U.S. Concrete (USCR) advanced 6.41 to 80.46, as it approached an 80.55 buy point. The stock traded above that entry earlier today. Eagle Materials (EXP) rose 7%, Summit Materials (SUM) 5%, and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 4%.The mobile homes and RV group is another niche that could benefit from the Harvey repairs. The industry group gained 5% Monday, lost 0.6% Tuesday and was up 0.8% midday Wednesday.Playing storm-related stocks can be tricky. When Hurricane Irene hit Aug. 26, 2011, the cement and RV stocks followed a pattern. In the first few days after the storm hit, the stocks rose. But then they corrected about 10% over several weeks and only then did they show strong upside action. After a short-term low, the stocks rose 55% to 60% over several months.If history repeats, there could be some turbulence ahead for the storm stocks and eventually some big profits.Stocks on the move midday Wednesday included Universal Display (OLED), up 12% and approaching a 127.88 buy point in a double-bottom base; electronics sector play Kemet (KEM), up 7% and at a new high; chip equipment maker Ichor Holdings (ICHR), up 5% as it approaches a 24.40 buy point in a double-bottom base; and United Rentals (URI), up 3.5%.On the downside, biotech Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) lost 4%, but this was to be expected after a 20% gain Tuesday. Some market watchers are speculating that Juno could become an acquisition target.RELATED:Gasoline Futures Soar While Crude Oil Falls

20,VMC,"Here's one of the biggest problems with President Trump taking credit for the Dow Jones industrial average's rise close to 22,000, as he did on Tuesday.X""Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!"" Trump tweeted.While there's no question that Trump has presided over a great period for the stock market, many of the so-called Trump stocks that were supposed to thrive on his watch have been laggards, such as Vulcan Materials (VMC), U.S. Steel (X) and Goldman Sachs (GS).At the same time, what might be called non-Trump stocks, have done pretty nicely. If there was any group for which Trump's election looked like a setback, it was the solar power industry. Yet IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups based on stock performance. Since Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, stocks like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) have been surging. (SunPower crashed 19% Wednesday on weak revenue guidance. First Solar, which reported strong results last week, dipped 2% but held onto most of its recent gains.)IBD'S TAKE: The No. 1 ranked insurer in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group isn't Dow stalwart UnitedHealth Group, which exited most ObamaCare markets early in 2017, but an insurer whose prospects are closely tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which insurer is setting the pace, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.The latest Trump stock to divee was Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of concrete, asphalt and other building materials that stood to benefit from Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. On Tuesday, Martin Marietta came up 10 cents shy of earnings estimates and shares tumbled 6.4%, closing below where they finished on Nov. 9.Vulcan Materials, the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates, fell 3.2% on Tuesday to close below its Election Day, Nov. 8 level. Vulcan Materials did rebound 3.3% on the stock market today despite reporting its own weak earnings.Infrastructure plans have been on the back burner while Trump prioritized the seemingly failed effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.The steel sector was supposed to soar on Trump steel tariffs that looked like a sure bet, but no longer look so certain after pushback from foreign trading partners. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that action to curtail steel imports may wait until after tax reform and infrastructure. U.S. Steel briefly surged on positive earnings news last week, but was quickly undercut by the disappointment over tariffs. U.S. Steel and Nucor (NUE) both closed lower on Tuesday than they did on Nov. 9.Bank stocks were supposed to be another triple-threat group under Trump, poised to gain from regulatory relief, tax cuts and rising interest rates prompted in part by Trump's big fiscal plans. Here the record is somewhat better. Regulators did sign off on bigger capital return plans for big banks that passed their stress tests. But Wall Street has been scaling back expectations for corporate-tax cuts and the Federal Reserve has tabled its rate-hiking plans as inflation pressures fail to materialize. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares surged in the weeks after Trump's election, but they've been Dow laggards since the start of 2017, with Goldman down 5% and JPMorgan up 8%, compared to the Dow's 11% gain and the Nasdaq's 18%.Many banks have reported weak trading revenue in early 2017, but Goldman reported a stunning 40% plunge in fixed income, commodity and currency trading revenue in the second quarter.While bank stocks have been mostly range-bound in recent months, Morgan Stanley (MS) has cleared a buy point and Bank of America (BAC) is near a buy zone above 25.21. But even those two bank leaders have slightly lagged the general market over the past four months.The expectations were that Trump would fuel growth and the Fed would be more proactive about raising interest rates, but with doubts creeping higher about the scope and timing of any fiscal fuel, some economists have marked down their growth expectations. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it now expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year and next, down from prior forecasts of 2.3% growth this year and 2.5% in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetSolar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking LawWhy There's No Trump Bump For Infrastructure StocksCheck Out These 4 Energy Plays Near Buy Zones

22,VMC,"Every time the U.S. economy has seem poised to break out of its slow-growth, low-inflation trend, something has undercut its momentum.The federal fiscal-cliff and debt-limit fights, an oil patch recession, the global financial market spillovers from China, and a pullback from peak auto sales all have taken a turn as the economic headwind du jour.Yet what some have called ""secular stagnation"" or ""the new normal"" is largely about America — along with much of the rich world — turning gray. Aging has cut 1.25 percentage points from both trend GDP growth and the neutral real interest rate in the U.S. since 1980, with most of that coming since the early 2000s, according to Federal Reserve researchers.So far, sluggish growth has been overcome by persistence. As the current economic expansion enters its ninth year, the jobless rate is at a 16-year low while the S&P 500 index and other major averages are up sharply so far this year. Yet GDP growth likely will continue to slow. Meanwhile, big institutional investors and policymakers increasingly worry about what lies ahead as an inevitable battle plays out over how to pay for massive retirement promises to baby boomers and how much to raise taxes on Gen Xers and millennials.It won't help that today's slow growth may soon look like the good old days. David Doyle, North American economist at Macquarie Research, notes that the oldest baby boomers are in their 70s, when workforce participation rapidly dwindles. ""Demographics will soon act as a severe constraint on potential output growth,"" Doyle wrote recently.America aged gracefully early this century, with the working-age population (20-64) expanding much more than the senior population. But the tide shifted in 2012. Over the coming two decades, the senior population is projected to swell by 30 million vs. just 15 million for working-age adults.In 20 years, the whole country will look like Florida — only older. Now 20% of Floridians are 65 and older vs. 15% for the country as a whole. Two decades from now, 21% of Americans will be seniors, according to Social Security Administration projections.Economic headwinds will intensify as government budgets are swamped. While jobs should be plentiful for Gen Xers and millennials, there will be fewer workers per retiree to meet all of those trillions of dollars in off-budget pension and health care promises.A decade ago, 3.3 workers paid into Social Security for every beneficiary. By 2037, that will fall to 2.1 workers. The situation is already far worse for local governments like Chicago, which has 47,000 retirees drawing pensions and only 34,000 current government workers (excluding Chicago Public Schools).That portends ""unsustainable pressure on future taxpayers,"" Citi analysts wrote in a 2016 report that pegged the scope of pension underfunding at $78 trillion among the 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations.Despite an eight-year bull market, unfunded state and local pension liabilities have ballooned to an estimated $4 trillion.  Moody's figures that the total value of benefits promised to current and future U.S. retirees but not paid for tops $23 trillion — bigger than gross domestic product. That includes unfunded promises for federal employees ($3.5 trillion), Social Security ($13.4 trillion) and Medicare's Hospital Insurance program ($3.2 trillion).Paying off retirement promises will be even harder with a sluggish economy. The 2.2% average growth since mid-2009 has made this the slowest expansion since World War II. Federal Reserve policymakers expect growth to slow to 1.9% by 2019. Doyle of Macquarie Research sees 1.4% growth by 2020.""We see no major economic risks on the horizon for the next year or two,"" Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, wrote in May on LinkedIn. Yet the ""longer term looks scary.""""We see an intensifying financing squeeze emerging from a combination of slow income growth, low investment returns and an acceleration in liabilities coming due both because of the relatively high levels of debt and because of large pension and health care liabilities,"" Dalio wrote.John Mauldin of Mauldin Economics sees major implications for financial markets: ""A time is coming when the market and voters will realize that these obligations cannot be met. Will voters decide to tax 'the rich' more? Will they increase their VAT rates and further slow growth? Will they reduce benefits? No matter what they decide, hard choices will bring political turmoil, which will mean market turmoil.""In Dalio's view, the economy is approaching the end of a long-term borrowing cycle. Soon debt levels will be too high to keep rising, putting economic growth at risk. Yet fiscal and monetary authorities will have largely exhausted their policy arsenals, leaving insufficient ammunition to combat a downturn.Since 2007, debt-to-GDP has more than doubled to 77%. It's expected to keep soaring amid a structural federal deficit that's projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2023 and approach $1.5 trillion in 2027.Already, political populism has flared, with globalization and immigration both losing support. Prepare for more of the same, Dalio says. ""We fear that whatever the magnitude of the downturn that eventually comes, whenever it eventually comes, it will likely produce much greater social and political conflict than currently exists,"" he said.Fed policymakers don't speak so forcefully. But their vision isn't exactly calming.San Francisco Fed President John Williams explained in a June 27 speech that ""demographic waves and slower growth have driven down the longer-term normal or 'natural' real rate of interest — or r-star — to historic lows in country after country.""With interest rates near zero, ""central banks will face daunting challenges in stabilizing their economies in response to negative shocks,"" Williams said. The ""global slump"" in growth will test fiscal policymakers too, he added. They'll be asked to do more with less — ""in some cases much less"" — as unfunded liabilities in pensions and safety-net programs multiply.All that adds pressure on the Fed to keep the current expansion going as long as possible. Recent drops in the jobless rate, even as inflation has subsided, suggest the expansion can keep running without the Fed having to hit the brakes.But some economists worry that the unemployment-inflation link hasn't vanished. They fear the Fed may fall behind the curve, forcing it to react abruptly. Once unemployment hits bottom and starts creeping up, recessions usually aren't far behind.A recent analysis by Moody's Investors Service drove home just how fast pressures will build if the economy sags or financial markets turn lower. If state and local pensions suffered a 5% decline in one year and flat returns for the next two, unfunded liabilities would soar 59%, from $4 trillion to $6.4 trillion.Meanwhile, state and local governments face pressure from the rising cost of retiree health benefits, which are underfunded by $862 billion, according to a report last year from the Center for State & Local Government Excellence.Public pension funds typically assume investment returns above 7% when calculating their unfunded liabilities. The Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System board met in July to consider lowering its return assumption from 7.5%. A 7.25% assumed return would increase L.A.'s required contribution by $38 million next year, and a 7% rate would require $93 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Already pension costs take up about $1 billion, or 20% of the budget.So what did L.A. decide to do? Punt.States and municipalities around the country have been doing the same. But many experts think that public pensions should assume returns of about 3%, more like governments outside the U.S. This would provide certainty for taxpayers and pensioners, matching the seeming certainty of the costs, since courts have largely said that the benefits can't be taken away. But that would require governments to sharply increase pension contributions now.The ""growth slump"" that the Fed's Williams cites reflects smaller gains in the labor force and in productivity. They may be connected. Fed researchers believe that ""a current abundance of capital relative to labor"" has depressed the return on capital and caused aggregate investment to decline. Doyle notes that workers over 55 are less likely to increase their productivity, while workers near retirement may still be more productive than their young replacements.The Census forecasts that the U.S. working-age population will grow just 0.3% per year through 2026, with immigration providing most of the increase. Nonfarm productivity growth has averaged just 0.6% over the past five years, a far cry from the post-World War II average of 2.1%. Productivity fell 0.1% in 2016, the first annual drop since 1982.""It becomes clear that a sea change is taking shape,"" Williams said. ""What's less clear is how global policymakers will respond to these shifts — whether they will make the necessary long-term investments in priorities like education, job training, science and infrastructure that can break this slump, or whether they will allow this slump to break them.""Policymakers can try to boost the workforce by improving incentives, such as lowering marginal tax rates, or raising the age at which workers retire by restructuring pension promises.One big uncertainty is whether federal, state and local governments will adjust their pension promises. If not, government retirees will have more to spend and low-inflation pressures may subside. But how governments pay for those promises will create another set of troubling circumstances.Illinois has seen population declines amid tax hikes and a pileup in unpaid bills as it wrestles with massive pension liabilities. Construction materials provider Vulcan Materials (VMC) noted this month that the state budget crisis had delayed public infrastructure projects.Such problems are expected to mount, and not only in Illinois. ""We are now at a point where the assets of the pension fund are being liquidated to meet current retiree benefits,"" Gordon MacInnes of left-leaning New Jersey Policy Perspective told the Tax Notes publication. ""All you need is one more recession and you are wiped out. Then you are going to have to take tax receipts that are intended for schooling, and you're going to have warfare.""More cities and counties will likely be pushed into bankruptcy. States haven't had that option, but it's possible that will change.Japan is furthest along in facing an end to its long-term debt cycle, Dalio notes. It got hit first with aging demographics, with the total population rapidly shrinking.Japan hasn't restructured promises but instead allowed debt to swell to 200% of GDP. Eventually, the Bank of Japan ended up taking on massive amounts of Japanese government debt and even buying loads of equities.To some, Japan is a cautionary tale. But to some on the political left, it shows what's possible. After all, Japan's economy hasn't fallen apart and interest rates haven't spiked. Despite all the Fed did to revive the economy after the financial crisis, it's possible that we haven't seen anything yet.

26,VMC,"Federal Reserve policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017.Fed members may have taken their cue from investors, who lit a fire under the shares of companies that stand to benefit from a big infrastructure push: equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), cement makers Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), and copper miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX). Meanwhile shares of Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) flew on prospects for higher rates and a steepening yield curve, as well as deregulation hopes.But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy. Now the Fed, like investors, is in wait-and-see mode to watch what can get through Congress, when it will affect the real economy, and whether Trump's immigration and trade policies curb or offset the force of his pro-growth moves.Policymakers are virtually certain to leave the central bank's key interest rate unchanged at the two-day meeting that will wrap up with a statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Financial markets, which are pricing in just 4% odds of a rate hike, currently expect two rate hikes this year, coming in June and December. Investors will be looking for any hints that the Fed will instead stick to the trajectory of three rate hikes in 2017 that was implied by policymakers' forecasts issued after the December meeting.But don't expect any clarity on Wednesday.

32,VMC,"The fate and size of Donald Trump's infrastructure spending plan remains in flux, but if his proposals to update airports, bridges and roads moves forward, it could mean big gains for building materials stocks like U.S. Concrete (USCR), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC).The politics and uncertainty of Trump's budget have affected all three stocks and others in the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group. U.S. Concrete and Martin Marietta flashed signs of a potential breakout, but failed to move higher. Both appear to be regrouping for another try, and Vulcan Materials continues to work on a new base.On Wednesday, U.S. Concrete saw its Relative Strength (RS) Rating rise from 67 to 72 – a welcome improvement, but still shy of the 80 or better score you prefer to see.

37,VMC,"Steel stocks got some of their old Trump magic back for a day, as one of the best-performing groups in the month after the November election, led the market on Thursday.As Washington was transfixed by ex-FBI Director James Comey's testimony, Wall Street was fired up by word from the Trump administration that it's getting ready to tilt the balance of trade more in favor of U.S. steel producers.Investors picked beaten-down shares of AK Steel (AKS) out of the scrap heap, as it led the way with a 5.5% advance on the stock market today. Steel Dynamics (STLD) climbed 5.2%, US Steel (X) 4.7% and Nucor (NUE) 3.4%.The steel rally was sparked by the tag-team of President Trump, speaking Wednesday afternoon in Cincinnati, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing before a Senate panel on Thursday. Still, investors may have felt some sense of relief that Comey's testimony wasn't more damaging.Trump, while touting his still-developing plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure boost, added that ""steel folks are going to be very happy"" with coming actions to stop the dumping of foreign steel.On Thursday, Ross said that the Trump administration is very close to wrapping up its investigation into whether imports of steel are hurting national security, which could pave the way for protectionist measures under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.There doesn't seem to be much doubt about the outcome, with Ross calling steel imports ""a genuine national security issue"" and laying out possible recommendations for stemming the flow. Ross said a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel.""The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,"" Ross said.Meanwhile, cement and asphalt makers, which have much to gain from Trump's infrastructure plans, finally got a boost on day four of the White House's big infrastructure week. Vulcan Materials (VMC) gained 1.3%, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) 2%, and Summit Materials (SUM) 2.1%.RELATED:Trump Turbocharged Thursday's Top-Performing Stock Group Steel Stock With 258% Growth Is Testing Its Mettle U.S. Steel Is In Full Meltdown After Stunning Loss

"
39,VMC,"The only apparent news during President Trump's big infrastructure week is that the door has fully closed on the possibility of a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill, and that likely means a legislative push will slip to 2018.The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that the White House is now making clear that it plans to seek approval of infrastructure funding via budget reconciliation, requiring a simple majority in the Senate, to avoid the possibility of a Democratic filibuster. Because Senate rules limit the GOP to just one use of budget reconciliation per year — this year's is reserved for ObamaCare repeal — that means infrastructure spending and tax cuts will have to be paired together.That's not music to the ears of investors. On Tuesday, shares of construction material suppliers lagging the broader market. Vulcan Materials (VMC) slipped 0.6%, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) 0.9%, and Eagle Materials (EXP) 1.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index lost 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on the stock market today, while the Nasdaq turned slightly higher. Shares of construction equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), a Dow component, eased 0.6% but were still close to a 30-month high, though the company is more of a play on global growth and less a proxy for U.S. infrastructure than cement makers.Trump's determination to get infrastructure done through reconciliation will tie his national building program ambitions to prospects for overhauling the nation's tax code, which look uncertain at the moment given the inability of Republican leaders to agree on how to offset the cost of tax cuts, or even if the cost should be offset. The legislative undertaking will be extremely contentious and complex, and it can't even get underway until the GOP ends its effort to repeal ObamaCare (win or lose), raises the debt ceiling and passes a budget.IBD'S TAKE: Construction stocks soared after the November election, but it wasn't only because of Donald Trump's surprise election. Voters also approved a host of big infrastructure-related ballot initiatives. Then in April, California's legislature approved a gas-tax hike to fund more than $50 billion in road fixes and highway projects. Only a couple of months ago, Trump was discussing the possibility of a gas-tax hike to fund infrastructure spending, but that idea seems unlikely to fly in a bill that will need the votes of 50 of 52 GOP senators to pass and will most likely occur during an election year. Trump also had flirted with the idea of working with Democrats after the first House ObamaCare repeal bill went down in flames in late March. That may well have been just a ruse to break down GOP obstruction, but cooperation with Democrats has seemed increasingly unlikely as the Russia investigation has heated up.After pushing a plan to privatize the nation's air traffic control system on Monday, Trump will head to Cincinnati, on the Ohio River, on Wednesday to discuss the necessity of investing in the nation's highways, bridges and inland waterways. Then he'll host mayors and governors at the White House on Thursday and attend a Friday forum on expediting regulatory approval for road and rail projects.The White House plan is to seek $200 billion in federal funding for infrastructure that it hopes to leverage into $1 trillion in building projects by attracting private capital. There certainly appears to be private capital lining up to participate, with Blackstone Group (BX) recently announcing a $40 billion infrastructure fund, part of the $100 billion it expects to invest in infrastructure in coming years.Democrats have criticized Trump's focus on public-private partnerships, which they say may draw investment to booming metropolitan areas where investors might reap profits from toll roads, but will shortchange rural areas and won't help rebuild schools.The White House has floated another idea to attract capital called ""asset recycling"" based on Australia's experience leasing a state-owned electrical grid to private investors to pay for improvements to the Sydney Metro. The idea would be to encourage state and local governments to transfer public assets such as bridges or highway rest stops to private investors to free up infrastructure funds, with the federal government providing matching funds as an incentive. The idea may have potential but reinforces the takeaway that Trump's infrastructure plans, assuming they pass, may not have much of an economic impact before 2019.RELATED:Today's Words That Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts5 Big Ways That Trump's Budget Doesn't Add Up Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: Goldman

While prospects for those remain uncertain, state and local governments are stepping up with new infrastructure projects.Vulcan maintained full-year guidance for adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 to $1.225 billion, ""driven by a continuing recovery in shipments, with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand.""Aggregates prices increased 5%, which Vulcan said is ""a good indication of the market's visibility to further demand recovery.""RELATED:Trump Infrastructure Play Soars As Earnings Top On Price HikesFerrari Leads 5 Stocks Racing Higher On EarningsNvidia Rockets On Q1 Beat; MaxLinear, Microchip Top ViewsTop Chinese Internets Autohome, YY Earnings Top ViewsWill Snap, China's Internet Stocks Leap Like JD?

41,VMC,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending shares of the Trump infrastructure play surging.Martin Marietta earned 67 cents per share on revenue of $791.7 million. Analysts expected the Raleigh, N.C., provider of construction materials to earn 66 cents a share, down from 69 cents a year ago. Revenue was seen slipping to $724.7 million from $734.0 million. Year-earlier results were lifted by weather delays in late 2015 that lumped more activity in the first quarter of 2016.Outlook: Martin Marietta maintained the same full-year guidance it offered in February: $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion in revenue and an EBITDA range of $1.05 billion to $1.13 billion.Stock: Shares of Martin Marietta shot up 7.6% to 239.85 on the stock market today, the highest since late January and approaching a 244.08 buy point. Vulcan Materials (VMC), which reports earnings on May 10, popped 4.1% to 128.45.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may no longer be banking on President Trump's trillion-dollar national building program, at least in the near term, but infrastructure investors are excited about big state spending plans.Prior to the report, shares of Martin Marietta have climbed back above their 50-day moving average. The shares initially vaulted into a buy zone on Nov. 9, after the surprise election of Donald Trump. A follow-on breakout attempt in late January, after the inauguration, failed. The stock drifted lower after disappointing first-quarter earnings and lack of progress on Trump's big infrastructure plans.On Monday, IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group rose 2%, sixth best among 197 industry groups. President Trump's comments that he would support a gas tax to fund infrastructure investment likely contributed to the gain. Summit Materials (SUM) hit a nearly two-year high on Monday.Monday's gains came despite news that a five-month budget deal in Congress won't include any funding for Trump's border wall, once seen as a potential boon to cement makers with facilities near the border.Martin Marietta noted that it saw ""broad-based pricing improvements"" across its aggregates product line, led by the Southeast group's 10.3% increase. The company's revenue gain was padded by acquisitions that added $27 million, with modest margin contribution. Management noted that it ramped up investment in the quarter on operations and staffing, adding that the investment should result in better operating leverage as growth continues.RELATED: Stock Futures: These 10 Big-Cap Earnings Are On Tap TuesdayHere's Why U.S. Concrete Shares Sank Like A StoneMartin Marietta 'Encouraged' By Trump Infrastructure Talk, But Earnings, Guidance Light

51,VMC,"Stocks gained as a whole Thursday, as investors favored industrial and banking sectors as likely beneficiaries of four years of Donald Trump policies. But big-name computer, software and internet tech shares including Apple (AAPL) suffered another dose of heavy profit-taking.The Dow Jones industrials paced the market's upside, rising more than 1.1%. Banking, metal ores, machinery and shipping transport firms led the upside. Department store chains rebounded furiously.The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, while the Russell 2000 surged 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.8%. Crude oil sank nearly 2%, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond surged again, up to 2.14%.Volume edged mildly higher on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.Apple symbolized the sharp sell-off in tech land, falling nearly 3% to 107.67 in above-average volume. At one point, the stock reached as low as 105.83, down a little more than 4% below its Sept. 14 breakout price of 110.33.For now, the stock can be held by those who bought correctly. And despite the sharp drop, Apple still maintains a trend of higher highs and higher lows since bottoming out at 89.47 on May 12. However, continued weakness in not only Apple but in fellow tech stalwarts would justify an early exit in the stock so that one does not lose an opportunity to get exposure in those sectors that are heating up.As seen in the stock market today, banking, industrial and manufacturing stocks ruled the day. Copper futures continued to jump as the market appeared to favor those industries that may get a boost from President-Elect Trump's pledge to boost manufacturing, construction and infrastructure rebuilding within America.General Motors (GM) gained more than 5% to 32.73 in double normal volume and reaching a nearly three-week high. The car and truck giant is perhaps working on a bottoming-style saucer base after lagging the market since the end of 2013. A strong move past 33.18 would lead to a breakout. Also, watch for potential upside resistance near the 33-35 price level.Wall Street currently sees GM profit rising 19% this year but sinking 4% in 2017.The head of United Auto Workers expressed confidence on Thursday that his union can work with Trump in the area of trade policy, despite that workers group's prior endorsement of failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Vulcan Materials (VMC), which was added as a watch list idea at IBD Leaderboard, rose 3.4% to 136.04, adding to the prior five-day buying rush. The expert in concrete aggregates and materials for road construction has now risen nearly 7% past a 127.30 cup-base buy point, so it's extended. Try as best as possible to buy stocks within 5% of the proper entry. Even top growth names will immediately pull back to shake out weak holders and return near or to the exact entry point before potentially resuming their run.Vulcan is part of the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, which is rapidly rising up the rankings of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. As of Wednesday's close, the group ranked 55th, vs. 149th just six weeks ago.Other building-related groups ranking highly lately include Building-Heavy Construction (No. 16) and Steel-Producers (No. 22).Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged another 3% to 32.38. The highly profitable operator of mini-mills has now advanced 15% past a 28.11 cup buy point. It was featured in IBD's Stock Spotlight column ahead of Trump's upset win in Tuesday's presidential election.Some breakouts in the consumer space are making good progress.Planet Fitness (PLNT) rose nearly 4% to 23.91, sending shares now extended 7% past a 22.25 cup with handle buy point. The no-nonsense gym operator has been touted in IBD's IPO Leaders screen lately due to strong growth (EPS up 67%, sales up 26% in Q3) and solid stock price action. The Newington, N.H., firm went public in August 2015 at 16 a share.However, mortgage origination software specialist Ellie Mae (ELLI) got hammered, falling almost 8% to 95.57 in nearly five times its usual volume and caving well below its 50-day moving average. While there was no clear news, fund managers perhaps sold in the light of rising interest rates, which could pinch mortgage financing and refinancing activity.Ellie Mae also notched its biggest one-day point loss since its mid-February breakout past a 78.81 buy point, a key sell signal.RELATED:When Did Apple Break Out?What Is The Bottoming Base, And Does It Apply To Some Sectors Today?Know This Sell Signal: Biggest 1-Day Point Drop Since A Stock's BreakoutHow To Track The Market: Follow IBD's 197 Industry Group RankingsWhy Planet Fitness And Other Companies Are The New Young Turks Of Stocks

52,VMC,"U.S. stock indexes rose for a third consecutive day, climbing above their 50-day moving average lines, as the market took a second, more bullish take on a Trump presidency.The Nasdaq popped 1.1% and closed bullishly high in the day's range. The S&P 500 also grabbed a 1.1% gain, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4%. The small cap S&P 600 led with a 3.1% surge. Volume in the stock market today was higher across the board. The market outlook was upgraded to ""uptrend resumes.""Many of the day's leaders and laggards were reacting to the presidential and congressional elections. Small cap HealthEquity (HQY) roared 12% higher in busy volume. The provider of health savings accounts is likely to benefit under a Republican Senate, House and presidency. President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed health savings account in the past as part of an alternative to ObamaCare, which is likely to be either overturned or amended.The Medical-Hospitals industry group was the day's biggest loser, according to preliminary data. The group lost almost 10%, easily the worst among 197 industry groups. If ObamaCare is overturned, hospitals are likely to encounter more patients without medical insurance and in some cases, no way to pay the bills. Republicans haven't made clear what they would do to address the problem.On the upside, groups showing strong gains included steel producers, coal, construction equipment and cement-related companies. United States Steel (X) gapped up 17%. Westmoreland Coal (WLB) jumped 18%. Caterpillar (CAT) gapped up 8%. And three stocks in the cement group — Eagle Materials (EXP), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) — each staged breakouts from cup bases. A heads-up on the cement stocks was offered in Friday's Big Picture column.The market showed resilience in the wake of the election. On Tuesday night, futures sold off sharply as it became clear that Hillary Clinton would likely lose. But the fearful money exhausted itself in the first hour of trade Wednesday.The sell-off probably said less about the overall market than it did about the two candidates. Under Trump and a Republican Congress, different winners and losers are likely in the stock market than under Clinton. Investments that had bet on a Clinton victory probably were sold and shifted to stocks likely to benefit under Trump. More of that could continue in the days ahead.RELATED:Hospital Stocks Get Post-Trump Stress DisorderWill Trump Spur Lasting Stock Rally?

Intel (INTC) topped that group with a 0.9% gain.Cement and construction aggregates stocks posted Friday's strongest move among industries. Martin Marietta (MLM) jumped 3% after receiving an upgrade to buy, from neutral, from Cleveland Research. Citigroup had initiated coverage on Thursday on Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials (VMC), with buy ratings on both stocks.  Vulcan rose nearly 3% Friday. The day's gains left both stocks poised for a test of resistance at their 10-week moving averages.The alternative energy group posted a strong session, helped by TPI Composites' (TPIC) 4% advance. Barclays initiated coverage on the stock with a buy ranting and a 24 price target. The thinly-traded stock is in the sixth week of a possible base pattern, trading 73% above its July IPO price.Herbicide and insecticide maker FMC (FMC) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 13% after DuPont (DD) announced FMC would acquire DuPont's crop protection products business for $1.2 billion in cash, as well as an exchange for FMC's health and nutrition unit. The gain put shares well above a a 62.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but the gap up breakout established a new buy range, starting at 69.72.The FMC sale was the first divestiture aimed at meeting regulatory requirements for the planned $77 billion merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical (DOW). The two companies today said they expect to close the deal in August. DuPont ended down 1.2% and Dow shares were off 0.5%.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) grabbed the second hottest slot among S&P 500 stocks, up more than 4% after Macquarie launched coverage on the stock, although at a neutral rating. Advanced Micro is riding steady support at its 10-week line, in the fifth week of a consolidation. Shares are up 29% since Dec. 30.IBD Leaderboard stock Apple (AAPL) settled 0.1% lower Friday to take a 2.2% gain for the week. That left shares still in a buy range above a 141.12 buy point in a four weeks tight pattern.Among IBD 50 stocks, TAL Education (TAL) popped 4% in light trade, returning to just below its March 24 high.

59,VMC,"Steel stocks rebounded Tuesday after sliding Monday with the broader market on news of falling scrap prices. The catalyst may have been news reports that the White House is considering quicker action on President Trump's trillion-dollar national infrastructure plan.While markets were higher across the board, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all up modestly on the stock market today, Trump-related infrastructure stocks were outperforming.Among steel makers, Tenaris (TS) jumped 4.9%, AK Steel (AKS) rose 3.2%, Nucor (NUE) 1.2%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 2.8% and U.S. Steel (X) 2.8%.Materials and construction equipment stocks also got a lift, with Vulcan Materials (VMC) up 1.9%, Martin Marietta (MLM) 1.4% and Caterpillar (CAT) 1.6%.The outsize gain for AK Steel, whose shares had sunk 36% from a multiyear high set in early January, came amid speculation that the slumping steel maker may be a takeover target.Last week, JPMorgan analyst Mike Gambardella raised his price targets on AK Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and U.S. Steel amid expectations of stronger earnings growth and earnings preannouncements from Nucor and Steel Dynamics. His thesis: Steel-sheet imports are headed lower thanks to trade enforcement. Along with ""continued domestic producer supply discipline,"" that will help support steel prices in the U.S.But Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz said in Monday research note that East Coast steel-scrap prices had fallen $30 a ton, a negative sign for demand. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.M&A could be a positive for the entire sector if it reinforces supply discipline, and the Trump administration might be more amenable to steel industry mergers than the Obama administration.While prospects for Trump's infrastructure plan remain unclear, Axios reported that the White House is thinking about packaging its building program with tax cuts this year. There had been talk that infrastructure funding legislation could slip to 2018.RELATED:A Second Top Steel Maker In 2 Days Just Gave Blowout Earnings GuidanceThis Top Steel Stock Is Near A Buy Point On Huge Earnings GuidanceTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

60,VMC,"Tense, late-stage maneuvering at the White House and the Capitol kept markets on edge straight to Friday's close, with major indexes ending mixed and the Dow Jones industrial average chalking up its worst week since the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Dow lost 0.3% Friday and 1.3% for the week. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took what were far-and-away the Dow's worst losses for the week, down 6.5% and 4%, respectively.Also in the Dow 30, Apple (AAPL) and McDonald's (MCD) each managed modest gains for the week and Nike (NKE), which on Wednesday dived more than 7% after a weak earnings report, on Friday trimmed its decline for the week to less than 3%.The S&P 500 sagged 0.1%, ending the week with a 1.3% loss — also its worst week since just before the election. Heavy engineering, steel and suppliers of construction materials took the S&P 500's heaviest hits on Friday. Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), Fluor (FLR) and Nucor (NUE) each dumped more than 2% in Friday's session. It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now."" CAN SLIM investors can minimize risk by waiting for a proper base to form.The Nasdaq composite held its loss Friday to less than 0.1%, ending off 1.2% in its sharpest weekly slip since December. Micron topped the Nasdaq 100, with Western Digital (WDC), Tesla (TSLA), Cerner (CERN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all advancing 2% or more.Tesla chairman Elon Musk teased investors with tweets revealing new details regarding the company's upcoming Model 3, and more distant Model Y and Roadster vehicles. Tesla shares are five weeks into a consolidation — holding nice support at the stock's 10-week moving average, but it's slightly too deep to qualify as a flat base.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's TAL Education Group (TAL) jumped 3% Friday in its eighth straight daily advance. Shares are taking out new highs and are well-extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point of 83.97.BioTelemetry (BEAT) also gained 2%, narrowing its loss for the week to less than 3%. The stock bounced off its 10-week moving average on Thursday, but week volume nullified the move as a buying opportunity.RELATED:ObamaCare Repeal Vote Failure Threatens Tax Cuts — And Stock RallyChip Gear Makers Rise On Upbeat Micron OutlookStock Market Today: Do These 6 Chip Names Have A Shot At Big Gains In 2017?

The stock found support at its 200-day line last week.IBD'S TAKE: From President Trump's tweets to administration leaks regarding specific stocks and broader economic policy, IBD is keeping track of the Trump Economy.Group peers Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) fell fractionally. Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials both reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings earlier this month.All three stocks rose on Monday, when Trump said Monday that there is ""no choice"" but to step up infrastructure spending. Trump will lay out his policy ideas before Congress tonight, He said that ObamaCare repeal will come before tax reform, so it's unclear how high a priority infrastructure will be for the administration and Congress.Steel, concrete and construction stocks sold off last week on a report that the Trump administration could delay an infrastructure bill until 2018.U.S. Steel (X) rose 1.4% to finish at 38.72, well off morning highs of 40.10, after climbing 3.2% on Monday.

74,VMC,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) fell well short of second-quarter forecasts Tuesday after rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) badly missed quarterly estimates Monday.Martin Marietta, which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates for the construction industry and supplies chemicals to various industries, reported a 56% increase in second-quarter earnings per share to $1.90 on a 7.7% hike in revenue to $915.40 million. Analyst consensus was for $2 EPS and $946.74 million revenue.The wide earnings miss dashed hopes that Martin Marietta would record a second straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings. It beat earnings forecasts in the first quarter after missing the prior four straight quarters.Coming as it did after Vulcan badly missed, Martin Marietta's results raise a red flag about strength of the construction industry recovery, although it, like Vulcan, blamed the miss largely on inclement weather.Martin Marietta Chairman and Chief Executive Ward Nye said in a written statement that aggregates pricing rose, and when combined with cost cuts, that led to a 340 basis point increase in gross profit margin to 23%.""This gross margin expansion was achieved despite record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets, notably Texas, North Carolina and Colorado,"" Nye said. He added that the El Nino weather effect, which causes more storms and rainfall than normal in parts of the country, began in spring of 2015 and concluded at the end of May. With that gone, construction activity will likely pick up again.Martin Marietta shares closed up 1.1% at 198.50 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range after breaking out early last month.IBD'S TAKE: After consolidating from last September through the first part of July, Martin Marietta's stock is trying to stay above the 193.97 entry point it passed on July 7. To see how it fares vs. other big construction suppliers go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Rival Vulcan rose 0.2% to 116.56, after a 6% loss on Monday when it dropped below its 50-day average. It ended below that support line Tuesday. Vulcan Materials missed on both earnings and revenue growth Monday. In addition to bad weather, it cited project delays, indicating it could return to stronger growth later this year.Meanwhile, Martin Marietta and Vulcan continue to benefit from the housing recovery and will also likely get a boost from the $305 billion federal highway bill signed into law last December that will begin to take effect later this year and roll out over the next five years.Among other large construction materials suppliers, Eagle Materials (EXP) fell 2%, Summit Materials (SUM) dropped 4.3%, and Ireland's CRH (CRH) retreated 0.4%.

75,VMC,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales growth that fell short of what analysts had expected. The Trump infrastructure play also gave a subdued 2017 outlook, despite optimism about eventual public works spending.Estimates: $1.62 per share, up 40.8% from a year ago, on a 14.8% rise in revenue to $896.65 million.Results: Martin Marietta earned $1.55 per share on near-14% revenue gain to $889 million.Outlook: Martin Marietta sees 2017 revenue of $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion in revenue and an EBITDA range of $1.05 billion to $1.13 billion. Before the report, analysts had expected the supplier of construction aggregates to post 2017 revenue of $4.013 billion and EBITDA of $1.177 billion.But Martin Marietta remains upbeat about infrastructure prospects.""We are encouraged by the emerging bipartisan dialogue in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure,"" said CEO Ward Nye. ""We believe the new Administration and Congress should ensure increased, sustainable infrastructure funding commensurate with the nation's clear, underlying needs.""Stock: Shares ended trading down 2.2% to 226.41 on the stock market today. The stock has moved mostly sideways since Nov. 10, a day after it broke out of a base to a record high on investor excitement over President Trump's election.Shares briefly broke out from a flat base with a buy point at 236.51 in late January, but that quickly failed.Last week rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) missed earnings estimates, citing an earlier-than-expected seasonal ramp-down of construction activity in December, and gave softer-than-expected guidance.Vulcan Materials stock fell sharply over two days but found support at its 200-day line. Martin Marietta fell modestly, finding support at its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta in ranked No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to find out which company is ranked No. 1 based on earnings, stock performance, revenue, profit margins and other factors.Analysts see Martin Marietta as a potential winner from Trump's plans for an infrastructure push and a wall on the border with Mexico.RELATED:Vulcan Materials Sinks On Profit Miss, Awaits Trump StimulusTrump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking Out

76,VMC,"When a stock is living under its 10-week moving average, it's sort of like a down-and-out guy living under a bridge. However understandable the reasons for the misfortune might be, it's unlikely the next move is to Beverly Hills.IBD-style investors look at the stock living under the 10-week line the same way. The stock may go ahead and complete a base, but a breakout is unlikely to go far. Unlikely is the key word. There's a minority of situations where the breakout works.How should a disciplined investor play or not play a stock living under the 10-week line? The general bias is not to play such a stock, but the investor should be aware of mitigating factors, such as the fundamentals.Under IBD rules, a stock is bought on the fundamentals and the chart action. Knowing where both stand is important.Construction aggregates provider Vulcan Materials (VMC) makes for an interesting case study. The outcome isn't clear yet on the current pattern, but the three previous consolidations are done deals.The first base: In September 2015, Vulcan began shaping a base. At the time, the two most recent quarters showed a net loss of 16 cents a share and an earnings jump of 76%. That's not good enough. As William O'Neil points out in ""How to Make Money In Stocks,"" a turnaround stock should have at least ""two straight quarters of sharp earnings recovery.""Also, Vulcan's weekly chart showed a seven-week base with four weeks of living under the 10-week line.Result: The stock broke out in unacceptably low volume and rose 4% before failing.Second base: In November 2015, Vulcan began to consolidate. By the time the stock broke out in April 2016, Vulcan's most recent two quarters showed earnings growth of 139% and then 26 cents a share vs. a year ago loss. That was acceptable.What about the chart? Vulcan spent eight of the base's 18 weeks under the 10-week line — not good.Result: The April 2016 breakout was in light volume, but volume kicked in May 3, when the stock was still in the 5% buy zone. A buy at the 111.70 open led to a gain of about 14%. But getting most of that gain would've been tough.Third base: The pattern spanned July to November. Recent quarterly EPS growth was 38% and then 10%. Vulcan closed under the 10-week line in 12 of the 15 weeks.Result: The stock rose about 9% post-breakout and then failed.The current base: Vulcan has spent only three weeks under the 10-week line. Q4 results will be released Feb. 7. The cement group is expected to benefit from a Trump presidency.The Trump factor and the basing above the 10-week line might make the next breakout more lucrative.RELATED:Who Were The Leading Industry Groups During The Past Presidencies Since Reagan?The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Run: Which Sectors Will Win?Investor's Corner: Did You Miss Nvidia's 2016 Breakout?

77,VMC,"Shares of Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) fell Wednesday as more details surrounding a federal tax-evasion investigation dribbled out.Law enforcement raided the Peoria headquarters and two other Illinois offices of the construction-equipment maker last Thursday. Caterpillar management assured that it was cooperating with the investigation, which it said was likely linked to accusations that it used its Swiss replacement parts unit, CSARL, to minimize its tax bill.On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that an independent examination of Caterpillar's finances commissioned by the government concluded that Caterpillar committed tax fraud ""with the intention of maintaining a higher share price.""IBD'S TAKE: Infrastructure-stock investors are salivating over a potential boon from President Trump's $1 trillion spending binge, but voter-approved infrastructure projects at the state level are among the reasons why equipment, construction and materials stocks are on the rise.The commissioned report was written by Dartmouth University accounting professor Leslie Robinson.Caterpillar shares slid 2.8% to 93.23 on the stock market today, back below the 50-day moving average. It was a drag on the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed slightly lower.Caterpillar has not yet undercut the lows during last Thursday's raid. The stock is still close to a two-year high of 99.46.The company said in a February filing that it is ""vigorously contesting"" an IRS push to pay $2 billion in back taxes and penalties.Caterpillar told the Times it hadn't seen the report but continues to stand by the legality of its tax strategies. No charges have been filed, and it's not clear if government investigators share Robinson's conclusion.Meanwhile, President Trump plans to meet with various business leaders regarding infrastructure spending at the White House on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

Volume in the stock market today was about 18% higher on the NYSE and 4% higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.President Trump's speech Tuesday night initially had some stock analysts muttering over the lack of details on tax cuts, but the stock market itself was more generous. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped up at the open and then kept climbing.The action of the market itself is a much better guide to the market than the opinions of analysts.Amid IBD's 197 industry groups, winners led losers by a 14-to-1 ratio.The winner's circle for the day included some heretofore middle of the pack groups.Homebuilders, for example, are demonstrating strength. Stocks hitting 52-week highs included Pulte Group (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR) and MDC Holdings (MDC).Cement stocks, which also are middle of the pack, rebounded. Eagle Materials (EXP) popped almost 3%. The stock recently retook its 103.26 buy point and is still in the 5% buy zone. Vulcan Materials (VMC) gapped up 3.4% but couldn't retake its 50-day line.

Infrastructure stocks sold off last week on a report that the Trump administration could delay an infrastructure bill until 2018.

81,VMC,"Vulcan Materials (VMC) badly missed second-quarter financial estimates Monday, as bad weather and project delays hurt sales, driving its stock down sharply Monday and pulling the sector down.The maker of construction materials such as aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete's second-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items rose 36% to 90 cents on a 7% increase in revenue to $956.8 million. Wall Street had expected $1 per share earnings and $1 billion revenue. ""Weather patterns and the timing of large project activity have led to higher month-to-month and state-to-state variability in our shipments, somewhat masking the continued recovery in construction materials demand across our footprint,"" Vulcan Chief Executive Tom Hill said in a prepared statement.Specifically, in several markets higher levels of public funding for transportation and other infrastructure projects ""have yet to convert into construction activity, creating a 'lull' in materials shipments to these end uses,"" Hill said.Vulcan shares fell 6.2% to 116.31 on the stock market today, crashing below its 50-day moving average. Vulcan had traded above or found support at that key line since early February as a strong housing market and the $305 billion federal highway bill signed into law last December raised prospects.IBD'S TAKE: Vulcan Materials has a near-best 97 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. It's in the middle of the pack among construction suppliers. To see who tops the list, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Prior to earnings, its stock had a 97 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it had outperformed 97% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Rival Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is set to report second-quarter earnings Tuesday before the market opens. Consensus is for diluted earnings to grow 64% to $2 a share on an 11% increase in revenue to $946.74 million. Martin Marietta shares fell 3.1% to 196.31 Monday.Among other large construction materials companies, Ireland's CRH (CRH) was down 1.4%.

All three companies cited unusually harsh weather for the downturn though, saying they expect a quick return to robust growth. U.S. Concrete's Q2 earnings per share plunged 59% to 54 cents, 41 cents below forecasts. Revenue rose 12.7% to $275.75 million. Consensus was for $294.68 million.President and CEO William Sandbrook said U.S. Concrete faced ""near historical levels of significant inclement weather in our North Texas market."" Like Vulcan and Martin Marietta, he expects results to improve in the back half of the year, saying, ""Our underlying demand trends continue to be positive.""Gross profit margin fell to 19.4% from 21.4% in Q2 2015, as higher costs offset a rise in consolidated gross profit.

84,VMC,"The reviews for President Trump's speech to Congress were strongly positive, from pundits, the public and, so far, investors. But does the speech really matter.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time at Wednesday's opening bell, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also jumping to record highs. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED:

85,VMC,"Shares of Vulcan Materials (VMC), among the companies best positioned to take advantage of President Trump's big infrastructure push, fell to levels not seen since Election Day on a fourth-quarter earnings miss and cautious guidance.The Birmingham, Ala.-based company on Tuesday reported earnings of 69 cents a share, 16 cents below estimates and down from 74 cents a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $872 million, softer than the roughly 7% growth expected.Vulcan Materials shares fell 4.9% to end regular trading at 121.80 on the stock market today. Rival Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which reports earnings next week, slipped 1.7% to 226.62. Eagle Materials (EXP), which reported results for its December quarter on Jan. 24, was off 0.5% to 104.IBD'S TAKE: Vulcan shares signaled weakness before its earnings miss, pulling back to 50-day moving average after they had come close to a buy point. With the Trump rally hitting a bit of turbulence, check out IBD Leaderboard to find which leading stocks are holding up, which are shaping up as potential buys, and which are signaling that it may be time to take profits.Vulcan Chief Executive Tom Hill said in a press release that the fourth quarter was going along nicely before ""a mid-December ramp-down of the construction season in many of our markets, which was earlier than in 2015.""Aggregates pricing was up about 7% from a year ago in the quarter, but shipments fell 3.5%.Hill expressed optimism about the company's outlook, noting that ""key measures of both public and private construction starts have improved steadily since July.""Vulcan expects earnings before interest and taxes, or EBITDA, of between $1.125 billion and $1.225 billion in 2017, up from $966 billion in 2016, but that trails estimates of $1.254 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.The softer-than-expected guidance may reflect uncertainty over when Trump's infrastructure spending will ramp up and a possibility it may not be until 2018.RELATED:Trump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking OutEagle In Buy Range; Vulcan, Martin Marietta Approach Buy Points

86,VMC,"Waking up in late afternoon, the major market averages picked up a little momentum heading into Monday's close, with Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index hitting all-time highs.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all showed gains of around 0.1% to 0.2% shortly before the market close. Small caps made some noise with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking lower than Friday's levels. Nasdaq volume was on pace to be slightly higher.Caterpillar (CAT) and Chevron (CVX) outperformed in the Dow with gains of close to 2%.Big gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included Celgene (CELG). Shares of the biotech rose 3% to 121.84. It's back above the 10-week moving average as it works on a flat base with a 127.10 buy point.Strength in the Russell 2000 helped the cause of several IBD 50 names, including HealthEquity (HQY), Eagle Materials (EXP) and Nivdia (NVDA), which rose 4%, 2% and 3%, respectively.In the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) edged higher, a somewhat muted response after Warren Buffett told CNBC he increased his stake in the iPhone maker to about 133 million shares, more than twice what he owned at the end of 2016.Steel producers and aggregate firms rallied ahead of President Trump's address to Congress Tuesday, with Trump pledging a ""big"" spending boost. Last week, IBD's steel producer group dived nearly 5%, while the aggregate gave up close to 3%, after published reports said that an infrastructure bill could be delayed until 2018.U.S. Steel (X) looked poised to end a three-session slide, rising nearly 4%. It's getting support at the 50-day moving average but is still below a prior 39.24 buy point.Aggregate providers like Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) also jumped but are still below their 50-day lines after harsher sell-offs.Tesla (TSLA) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average, falling more than 4%, after Goldman slapped a sell rating on the stock. UBS reiterated a sell rating last week just ahead of the company's earnings report.WageWorks (WAGE) followed through nicely after Friday's breakout from flat base. Shares surged 8% Friday and 1.3% Monday to 79.80. It's extended now from a 75.38 buy point. WageWorks competes with HealthEquity in the area of health savings accounts for out-of-pocket medical expenses.Earnings reports to watch after the close included Priceline (PCLN) and Workday (WDAY). Both have showing relative price strength ahead of the results, but the market has shown in recent weeks that healthy charts before don't always equate to continued price strength.Tuesday will see Domino's (DPZ) report before the open, with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) due after the close.RELATED:Workday Sales Momentum Seen Continuing, Earnings On TapInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Salesforce.com Earnings Preview: Billings, M&A Outlook EyedBest Stocks To Buy And WatchWill Palo Alto Earnings Add To Security Stock Momentum? 
"
87,VMC,"President Trump on Monday called the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""unbelievably complex"" and said that his tax cut plans will have to wait in line.But Trump sounded all fired up to begin making good on his campaign plans for a massive infrastructure spending boost. That may be the easiest lift because of the bipartisan appeal of creating more construction jobs while making investments in highways, bridges and other productivity-enhancing projects.Trump's comments on Monday lit a fire under infrastructure stocks. Caterpillar (CAT) rose about 2%, U.S. Steel (X) 3.2%, Fluor (FLR) 1.9% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 2.4%. Those stocks got hammered last week when reports emerged that the White House was thinking of pushing an infrastructure bill to 2018.Yet there still might not be a green light for Trump's infrastructure plans. With the repeal-and-replace plan for President Obama's signature program running into trouble on multiple fronts, it's looking increasingly possible that Republicans will have to signal a retreat before the rest of their economic agenda can advance.According to Trump, everything is under control. He said on Monday that the White House has arrived at a ""really, really good"" solution to ObamaCare that he will discuss Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.""I think you'll like what you hear,"" he told insurers at the White House on Monday, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Investor confidence in President Trump may be riding on his Tuesday speech. High hopes for tax cuts, a surge in infrastructure spending and regulatory reform have helped fuel an explosive postelection stock market rally, but doubts have been creeping in about his ability to deliver.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average has rallied for 11 straight sessions as of Friday, the longest winning streak in decades.Trump's vow to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20% may hinge on the House GOP proposal for a 20% border tax that faces serious opposition in the Senate because it pits big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) against exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).No hint of a Plan B has emerged, and Trump signaled that he won't provide any details that might help investors gauge the prospects for tax reform advancing while ObamaCare is dominating the agenda. Trump's explanation was that tax reform would have to take into account the budget effect of repeal and replace.While there's good reason to expect regulatory reform to ease compliance costs across a wide array of industries, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) also have been lifted by hopes for a lower corporate tax rate and a steeper yield curve, which boosts net interest margins. Yet diminished confidence that a Trump economic package will do much for growth over the next year have led Treasury yields to sag in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet, if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The White House seems to have gone back and forth on whether it will support a border tax, which would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade and offset the cost of a lower corporate tax rate. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News that he has only just begun to study the border tax proposal. Last week, Mnuchin said the goal was to pass tax reform by August but acknowledged that the timetable could slip.Trump has made clear that figuring out what to do about ObamaCare is the top priority in the short term, but dissension among Republicans about how to replace the law raises the risk of a drawn-out effort, at best, with some risk of a quagmire. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office score of the House's approach to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare reportedly showed a big increase in the ranks of the uninsured, which runs counter to White House promises.Republicans are considering holding a vote to repeal big parts of ObamaCare, even if a victory is uncertain. That may be the best outcome for investors. Win or lose, ObamaCare would fall off the top of the agenda, clearing the way for more growth-oriented policies.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget BoostInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Will Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse 
"
88,VMC,"Steel makers, materials firms and other infrastructure-related stocks sold off Thursday on a report that President Trump could delay a big infrastructure spending bill until 2018.Trump has vowed huge spending on roads, airports and other projects, lifting the likes of U.S. Steel (X), Martin Marietta (MLM), BHP Billiton (BHP) and Dow industrials component Caterpillar (CAT), as well as copper and iron prices.But with a busy legislative agenda that includes corporate tax reform and ObamaCare repeal-and-replace, the Trump administration is mulling pushing infrastructure into 2018, Axios reported. One upside, GOP strategists say, is that debating the bill in the 2018 election year will make it easier to pass, as Democrats won't want to be seen opposing major projects and jobs in their districts and unions giving their support.Passing an infrastructure bill in 2018 would likely mean that spending starts in 2019, ramping up over time. That's a long time for companies and investors to wait for a payoff.U.S. Steel tumbled 7.85% on the stock market today, breaking below a recent buy point and approaching its 50-day line. Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) also sold off, dropping through their 50-day averages.Martin Marietta sank 4.7% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 3.15%, with the latter crashing below its 200-day moving average.Caterpillar retreated 2.7%, finding support at its 50-day line. A big infrastructure-spending boost could fuel demand for its mining and heavy construction equipment.Mining giant BHP Billiton lost 1.8%, also closing just above its 50-day line. Copper and iron ore prices retreated Thursday.RELATED:The Trump Economy
"
89,VMC,"Caterpillar (CAT) trounced fourth-quarter estimates Thursday but cut its 2017 revenue guidance, citing appreciation of the dollar, which will curb results from international operations.The construction equipment maker's Q4 EPS grew 12% to 83 cents, easily topping estimates of 66 cents. Revenue fell 13% to $9.57 billion, below the analyst consensus of $9.841 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Caterpillar expressed cautious optimism about the outlook but now sees 2017 revenue of $36 billion-$39 billion, with the midpoint of $37.5 billion, down from its prior guidance, which had a $38 billion midpoint. Analysts were also expecting $38 billion.The company also expects 2017 EPS of $2.90, below the $3.04 analyst consensus.Caterpillar shares fell nearly 1% to 97.22 on the stock market today. The stock is now just below a buy point at 97.40 after breaking out on Wednesday.Caterpillar shares have been lifted by prospects for a big infrastructure push in the U.S. by President Trump, including a wall on the border with Mexico, as well as improved prospects for commodities markets and global growth.But the company's outgoing CEO in December expressed some concern that its international business could suffer if the U.S. adopts protectionist policies. And any upside from the new administration would be further down the road.""Prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the United States are encouraging,"" Caterpillar said in its earnings statement Thursday. ""While these initiatives would likely be a solid positive for many of our businesses, we would not expect to begin to see meaningful effects of these changes until sometime in 2018.""IBD'S TAKE: Like Caterpillar, Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta enjoy the upside of the Trump infrastructure push but without the downside of soft international markets and a surplus of used equipment. IBD's top market writers track these and other Leaderboard stocks to help you spot buying opportunities and signals to take profits.Like Caterpillar, shares of Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of construction aggregates, broke above a buy point on Wednesday as Trump signed an order to start work on a wall along the border. Vulcan Materials (VMC) also rose and is approaching a buy point.While Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said the company sees ""signs of positive activity in some of our key end markets, the overall economic environment remains challenging.""Caterpillar expects miners' capital spending to be about flat in 2017 after several years of decline, but sales of some large construction equipment within its resource industries business will likely be down in 2017 vs. 2016.Further, Caterpillar expects some continued negative impact on construction industry sales in North America due to the availability of used equipment.RELATED:Trump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking OutAs The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The Way

90,VMC,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.As the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq set fresh record highs, investors will get a dose of economic reality, for better or worse, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill. Quarterly reports from more shale producers will continue to trickle in, this time from Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Devon Energy (DVN), while hot biotech Incyte (INCY) reports as well as construction materials provider Martin Marietta (MLM).The Fed chief gives her semiannual testimony on monetary policy at 10 a.m. ET before the Senate Banking Committee and follows it up Wednesday at 10 a.m. before the House Financial Services Committee. Investors will parse her words for clues on when the next rate hike will come. Recent data have been mixed, with the January jobs report showing a strong gain in payrolls but a slowdown in wage growth.Expect questions on how the agenda of the Trump administration and the GOP on spending and tax reforms could affect the Fed's stance. Trump's economic team has also talked about using alternative gauges of unemployment that incorporate people too discouraged to actively seek work, so watch for that too.The shale producer reports Q4 results after the market closes.Estimates: EPS to slip 7% to 54 cents while revenue surges 46% to $167.5 million.Stock: Shares fell 0.5% to 104.30 on the stock market today, but are still near a 113.33 buy point.Crude prices retreated Monday amid signs that U.S. production gains may offset the effects of OPEC's output cuts. The Permian Basin in particular has been the focus of U.S. activity and investment since oil prices started recovering last year. And as a Permian-focused company, any guidance from Diamondback on capital expenditures and output may indicate where other companies are headed.The oil exploration and production company reports Q4 results after the close.Estimates: EPS is seen plunging 73% to 21 cents, with revenue down 1.8% to $2.8 billion.Stock: Shares eased 0.3% to 45.26 but are within striking distance of a 50.79 entry.The biotech reports Q4 numbers before the opening bell.Estimates: EPS to sink 55% to 13 cents while revenue climbs 33% to $324.4 million.Stock: Shares slid 55 cents to 121.15 but broke out last month and are above buy range.RELATED:Incyte Gets $112 Million Boost On Novartis Jakavi Royalties: RBCIncyte Stock Breaks Out, It And Partner Merck Will Advance Key Trial The provider of construction aggregates reports Q4 results before the open.Estimates: EPS to jump 41% to $1.62 as revenue rises 15% to $896.65 million.Stock: Shares rose 0.5% to 231.39, as they try to retake a 236.51 buy point. Martin Marietta broke out in late January then fell below the buy zone days later amid doubts about an infrastructure spending package that was seen benefiting the company.Also, rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) recently missed estimates, citing an earlier-than-expected seasonal ramp-down of construction activity, and 2017 guidance was also softer than expected.
"
91,VMC,"President Trump is expected to sign Wednesday an executive order that paves the way for construction to begin on a wall along the border with Mexico.The order may come during his visit to the Department of Homeland Security at 1:25 p.m. ET, freeing up available funds to launch the undertaking and adding 5,000 customs and border patrol agents.While there's a huge amount of uncertainty about the project, whose cost could range from $10 billion to $25 billion, Trump appears determined to make good on one of his central, yet most controversial, campaign promises.Some of the companies who stand to benefit are leading suppliers of construction aggregates, including Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). Construction equipment makers Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) — two companies that Trump has specifically said he'll rely on to build his wall — also are likely to profit.Martin Marietta shares surged 3.2% to 242 at the close on the stock market today, clearing a 236.51 buy point. Vulcan rose 2.2% to 135.28, approaching a buy point above 138.18. Caterpillar gained 2% to 98.15, lifting it above a buy point at 97.40, while Deere rose 0.4% to 108.06, still in buy range after a breakout earlier this month.Mastec (MTZ), a provider of building, installation and maintenance services, rallied 1.5% to 40.85, after climbing as high as 41.65, briefly topping a 41 buy point. AECOM Technology (ACM), a construction services provider, gapped up 4.6% to 39.13, rising above its buy zone.After winning big in the Super Tuesday primaries last March, Trump said his wall will be built by American companies: ""I only want to use Caterpillar, if you wanna know the truth. Or John Deere. buy a lot of equipment from John Deere. I love John Deere, too.""Trump's inaugural vow to ""buy American and hire American"" suggest Caterpillar and Deere can still count on a big role in constructing the wall.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta and Vulcan aren't the only materials companies breaking out on the Trump trade. IBD's top market writers are tracking these and other Leaderboard stocks to help readers spot buying opportunities when they emerge and sell signals to lock in profits.Among the big uncertainties about the wall is whether it will really be made of concrete, as Trump has said, or if it will be a fence; whether it will cover most, all, or just a fraction of the nearly 2,000-mile border; how much funding Congress will appropriate; and whether Mexico will ultimately pay the cost.In a July analysis, Bernstein analysts wrote, ""Concrete is by far the best material to meet Trump's goal of building an imposing and effective barrier, while also offering the most cost-effective solution.""The analysts believe that Trump's wall could resemble the 420-mile Israeli West Bank barrier, large parts of which were built using precast concrete panels. Bernstein's base case of a 1,000-mile wall would require over $700 million in concrete and $240 million in cement.Further, they note that it's not economically feasible to transport heavy building materials over long distances, but Martin Marietta and Vulcan ""have significant aggregate operations in the area.""RELATED:Will Trump Spending Plan Boost Martin Marietta In 2017?Eagle In Buy Range; Vulcan, Martin Marietta Approach Buy PointsApple, GM, Boeing Are China's Top Hostages In A Trump Trade War

92,VMC,"Talk about a tricky balancing act. That's what MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) performs.The market has gone up and down like a kid on a trampoline for the past six months. Yet the $2.1 billion mutual fund's marching orders are to find companies that have the best opportunities for growth two to three years in the future and whose valuations underplay those growth prospects.So how does the mutual fund pursue those goals without getting crushed in the market's volatility in the meantime?""The benefit of a longer-term time horizon is that you can look through the market's short-term noise,"" said co-manager Paul Gordon, who runs the fund with colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""We also tend to look for companies that are heavily in control of their own fate, so events in the world shouldn't disproportionately impact them. They can grow through those issues.""It's not that the fund is looking for stocks that play dead for two or three years, Gordon says. What the fund wants is stocks whose earnings keep on growing for at least two or three years more. ""We're willing to trade a stock with a high current rate of growth for one where we can be confident in the duration of its (slightly slower) growth,"" Gordon said.That approach has enabled the fund to keep its footing during the market's gyrations. Going into Friday, the fund was up 6.23% so far this year, topping 72% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 4.54%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 7.49%. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.43% average annual gain beat 92% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.74% gain, while the big-cap bogey advanced at a 10.98% yearly pace.Also, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating is A. That means the its performance is among the top 10% of all mutual funds in that time.Helping to drive that record? Nine of the fund's top-10 holdings as of June 30 had a strong IBD Composite Rating of 80 or better. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.The portfolio also includes Mobileye (MBLY), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Monster Beverage (MNST). The latter two are on IBD's Leaderboard.Mobileye stock is up 9% this year, though 28% off its 52-week high.IBD'S TAKE: Mobileye dipped sharply last week, despite beating Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The downer was news that Mobileye will not extend its relationship with Tesla Motors. IBD's Paul Whitfield recently explained that Mobileye still has other irons in the fire, including a deal with BMW.The Israel-based developer of software and related technologies for camera-based advanced driver assistance systems -- which play a central role in the rise of self-driving robo-cars -- has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96.""Tesla is one of many Mobileye customers,"" Gordon said. ""They are not a significant percentage of sales currently."" Mobileye's pullback Tuesday was due to investors' fears that Tesla had found another supplier to provide autonomous driving chips at a lower price. Gordon doubts that's the case. ""And it's more difficult to imagine that a Ford (F), GM (GM) or even BMW (BMWYY) can do what Mobileye can.""Vulcan Materials, a building materials company, is up 26% so far this year. It pays a dividend yield of 0.6%, and it has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD, the second-highest possible.""Aggregates are a good business,"" Gordon said. ""It is highly localized, and Vulcan has a significant market share in its regions. As such, it has positive pricing (power), including through the last downturn.""With product volumes near all-time lows in a cyclical business, ""that tells us that Vulcan's risk-reward potential is skewed to the upside,"" Gordon said.The stock plunged 5% Monday to its 50-day moving average after Q2 revenue and earnings came in below analyst expectations.Monster Beverage is up 8% so far this year, having rallied from a steep decline in February.EPS growth rebounded 25% in the latest quarter, bouncing back from a 6% decline the prior quarter.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Gillian Rich says Monster is riding a caffeine high, fueled by rising consumption of energy drinks.""Energy drink consumption continues to gain share of total beverage consumption,"" Gordon said. ""And their deal with (Coca-Cola (KO)) lets them significantly increase distribution internationally with little operational risk or costs to Monster.""Teen-targeting discount chain Five Below (FIVE) is up about 58% so far this year. EPS rose 26% and 50% the past two quarters, respectively.Shares have trended lower in recent years amid investor concerns about same-store sales, Gordon says. ""What's changed is that same-store sales have recovered,"" Gordon said, while the chain still has a large opportunity to open new stores. ""Another point,"" Gordon said, ""is that Five Below has the potential to be one of the longest duration growth names in the portfolio.""Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up about 70% this year. EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters.""They've traditionally had very strong market share in PC gaming,"" Gordon said. ""Now they are focusing that same technology on new growth markets, including data centers and automotive. They have big opportunities in virtual reality and autonomous driving.""""We love to own stocks for five years or more,"" Gordon said."" That's why duration of growth is so important to us.""
"
93,VMC,"Shares of Eagle Materials (EXP) reached their highest level in nearly a year in the stock market today, clearing a buy point after the maker of cement products and other building materials reported first-quarter results that topped analyst expectations.Earnings per share rose 24% to 93 cents, above estimates for 86 cents. Revenue increased 4% to $297.5 million, passing analyst expectations for $295.5 million.Eagle Materials' shares rose 2.4% to 85.92 on Monday. The stock cleared a buy point of 83.10 on July 20 from a flat base, a bullish consolidation pattern. It's up around 40% since the beginning of the year. Shares currently have a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Big winning stocks tend to have very high Composite Ratings before they make a major advance.The Q1 results reflect growth in the construction industry.Revenues in the company's cement segment rose 13%, while the concrete and aggregates segment's revenues rose 22%.Gyspum wallboard and paperboard revenues rose 4%. Sales in the company's oil and gas proppants fell 78% due to a sales-volume drop in frac sand, which is used in fracking.The company said its frac sand business ""continues to be impacted by the significant slowdown in oil and gas drilling activity over the past 18 months; however, we continue to right-size the business to match our business with current activity levels.""IBD'S TAKE: The Building/Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is ranked 13 out of 197 tracked by IBD, helped by construction growth in the public and private sectors.

Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views.

96,VMC,"Vulcan Materials (VMC) stock appears headed for a new high soon, as the building materials maker builds momentum in the construction industry.RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall on Tuesday went so far as to say in a report that the maker of crushed rock and sand aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-to-use concrete is a ""Rock Star!"" in the materials industry. The exclamation point is his. Wetenhall raised his price target on Vulcan to 140 from 127 and maintained an outperform rating.Vulcan shares closed up 1.4% at 125.67 on the stock market today. Its stock boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. It was trading just a few points below its all-time high of 128.62 set in early April 2007.The Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group is ranked a lofty 14 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups. Among other leaders in the group are U.S. Concrete (USCR), which also boasts a 99 IBD Composite Rating and climbed 3.25%, and Eagle Materials (EXP), which rose 1%.Martin Marietta (MLM), which produces aggregates, but also chemicals for industrial and agriculture uses, rose 0.7%. Ireland-based construction materials giant CRH (CRH), which has a presence in the U.S. too, rose 1.2%.Wetenhall expects Vulcan to benefit as public sector spending, which accounts for 50% of its shipments, remains on track to grow by mid-single digits in 2016, driven by strength in highway construction. President Obama signed a $305 billion highway bill into law last December, ensuring that market leader Vulcan and others will see growth in that sector for several years.Private sector construction volumes are expected to rise by mid-double-digit levels this year, Wetenhall said. He noted in the report that there's a slowdown in nonresidential construction activity compared to 2015, but he still sees spending there rising by mid-single digits.RBC projects that Vulcan's earnings per share will grow from $2.16 in 2015 to $3.41 this year, $4.51 in 2017 and $5.40 in 2018.""Our estimates over the next three years reflect our confidence in management's ability to execute against its profit enhancement plan, which should lead to strong incremental margin performance,"" Wetenhall said.IBD'S TAKE: Vulcan shares continue to climb after breaking out of a cup base in April. Shares have surged over the past week. Vulcan has a composite rating of 99, the highest possible rank among stocks. Earnings growth is expected to stay in triple digits for the June quarter.

99,VMC,"When President Obama signed a $305 billion highway bill into law last December, it was good news for Vulcan Materials (VMC).For one, it meant Vulcan stood to gain more than any other building materials company from the legislation. But it also was one of many signs that the provider of aggregates -- crushed stone, sand and gravel -- is now paving a path to prosperity, a year after it was losing money.Another positive sign came late last month, when Britain decided to exit the European Union. The move rattled global markets, but Vulcan was among a handful of stocks that stood up well during the selling frenzy. Showing strength, its stock dipped just 0.4% on June 24, while the Dow industrials fell 611 points.Chief Executive Tom Hill told analysts on a recent earnings call that several things have come together for the company, most notably a long-term housing recovery. There also has been better execution on customer deliveries, fixed-cost leveraging and lower costs of goods sold. Meanwhile, prices continue to migrate upward toward longer-term higher return on capital.Hill also said the housing recovery still has legs.""I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand,"" he said. ""This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power.""Vulcan is the nation's largest pure-play maker of aggregate building materials. Public works account for about 50% of construction materials spending, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act allocated funds for work on U.S. roads, bridges, public transit and rail transportation systems over the next five years.Of the remainder, commercial buildings account for 30% of construction materials spending, and housing makes up the final 20%. With incomes slowly rising and housing recovery steady, driven by low interest rates and unemployment, Vulcan's prospects are bright, according to BB&T Capital Markets analyst Adam Thalhimer.""When I talk to private aggregates companies, they point to Vulcan as the best-run company in the space. They are the most consistent,"" Thalhimer said in an interview with IBD.Thalhimer said it's really not a complicated business. Vulcan's sales are all domestic.""Their cash cow is turning big rocks into little rocks"" and selling them, he said. He has a buy rating on Vulcan with a 135 price target.Birmingham, Ala.-based Vulcan, also a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials such as asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, crushed profit estimates in its most recent quarter, reporting 26 cents fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share on May 3, swinging from a 16-cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier. That was more than triple the analyst consensus estimate of 7 cents a share.The company recorded a 20% hike in first-quarter revenue to $755 million, easily beating forecasts for $711 million, while gross profit climbed 112%.""It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals,"" Hill said on the May 3 call with analysts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters call for earnings per share to climb 52% in the current quarter vs. the same quarter in 2015, to $1. Revenue is projected to grow 13% to $1.1 billion.Vulcan operates 315 sites that produce construction aggregates and more than 100 facilities that produce asphalt and/or concrete. It's costly to transport rocks and other construction materials, so Vulcan's nationwide quarry-to-construction-site reach gives it a defensible market position, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman.""It does come down to local domination,"" Thielman told IBD. ""You're not going to get outsiders in your end markets once you're in there and serving addressable areas,"" because it's just too costly for smaller companies to ship rocks long distances.Thielman has a neutral rating on Vulcan, based on its strong stock valuation, with a 115 price target.RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall called out Vulcan in a June 17 client note as a top performer in its markets. Wetenhall noted that housing starts for the month of May increased by 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.167 million units, topping estimates of 1.15 million.""From an investment standpoint, we remain confident that a healthy labor market will continue supporting a slow and steady recovery in the housing market,"" Wetenhall said. He has an outperform rating on Vulcan with a 114.08 price target.In February, Vulcan expanded its management team, including creating new positions. Stan Bass, who was a vice president with responsibility for the company's Western and Mountain West divisions, was named to the newly created post of chief growth officer.CEO Hill said in making the announcement that an executive growth officer was needed because ""our company is poised for a new era of strategic growth, building on our unparalleled positions in recovering and growing markets across the United States.""Additionally, former general counsel Michael Mills was named to the newly created chief administrative officer post. Former assistant counsel Jerry Perkins stepped up to the general counsel position. Brock Lodge, who previously was manager of Vulcan's Western division, including its strategic California operations, was promoted to president of that division.Although Vulcan is the 800-pound gorilla of construction aggregates in the U.S., it has competition. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is the other large, publicly traded aggregates supplier. But the Raleigh, N.C.-based company also sells specialty chemicals such as magnesia and has aggressively pursued the cement market.Like Vulcan, Martin Marietta boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Large international companies also have a toehold in the U.S. market, including Ireland's CRH (CRH), the largest company in the building materials group, with nearly $26 billion annual sales vs. about $3.6 billion each for Vulcan and Martin Marietta. However, CRH also sells security gates and fencing, bricks, shutters, awnings and other items.It's a fragmented market, and large local aggregate materials suppliers also vie in some regional markets, though they're much smaller than Vulcan and Martin Marietta.Vulcan's stock price reached a new intraday high of 120.83 Thursday and matched it again on Friday, its highest point since June 2007, just before the start of the 2007-2009 recession. Shares ended trading on both days around 120, and shares were down slightly Tuesday after the holiday weekend to end the day at 119.66.

100,VMC,"Want to buff up your portfolio? Check out this top-performing mutual fund for ideas about stocks and using the fund's diversification.The $11.9 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has grabbed an A+ 36-month performance rating from Investor's Business Daily, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Its 1.60% gain over the 12 months going into Friday topped 94% of the large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500, which was up 1.70%.At a time when its typical peer is down nearly 4% for the past year, how does MFS Growth do it? Foremost, the fund aims for companies that are positioned for years of growth. It looks for companies with high sustainable earnings growth and the ability to keep improving their fundamentals. And it prefers companies whose value is not fully appreciated by other investors.Also, right now its portfolio is virtually all U.S. stocks.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of the names that fulfills that wish list. In March the fund began its current stake in the maker of canned energy drinks. It was a top new buy for the fund in the first quarter.Share price is up 39% since its Feb. 11 low. First-quarter earnings per share rose 25%, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Revenue was $680.2 million, which beat the consensus analysts' estimate of $656.9 million. Monster topped analyst estimates in only one of the four quarters in 2015.Trading just above 155 early Friday, Monster remains in a buy range from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also expanded the number of outlets in which Monster Energy drinks are available.IBD's markets team has noted that Monster's revenue increases of 7% and 9% in the past two quarters were subpar based on CAN SLIM criteria. But Wall Street sees full-year sales picking up 14% in 2016. Also, Monster achieved a sharp bump up in after-tax margin to 24.4%, the highest in at least 19 quarters.Facebook (FB) was the fund's top holding as of April 30.The social media network titan's EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 16%, 33%, 46% and 83% in the past four frames. Revenue grew 39%, 41%, 52% and 52% the past four quarters.Trading around 113, Facebook is below its 50-day moving average and a 117.09 buy point. The stock gapped up over the buy point in late April on strong earnings, but hasn't made much progress since then.It could be forming a new flat base with a 121.18 entry, the markets team noted. Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a worst-possible E.The number of daily active Facebook users has topped 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform draws in the bulk of the company's ad revenue.Facebook is launching its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. On March 4, Facebook said shipments of some of its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headsets will be delayed due to parts shortages. The company is also looking for ways to monetize its WhatsApp mobile messaging service.Earlier this month, Facebook's executive board announced a plan that would prevent Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg from retaining majority control of the company if he exits from management. One key reason for the plan is to make it easier to attract a high quality successor to Zuckerberg.Vulcan Materials (VMC) is up 51% since its Jan. 20 low. It held its own during Friday's early broad market sell-off and actually gained ground.Vulcan supplies raw materials -- crushed stone, sand, gravel -- for road and highway construction.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It advanced 14%, 76%, 139% and 262% in the past four quarters. Revenues rose 13%, 19%, 14% and 20% in those periods.With profit growth like that, it's little wonder that 1,190 mutual funds owned the stock as of March 31, up from 1,011 as of June 30, 2015. Investors included top-notch funds like $107.8 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and $2.6 billion Invesco Mid Cap Growth (VGRAX).In April, MFS Growth added shares, tweaking its Vulcan weighting to 1.2%, up from 1.16% from March.Vulcan has bounced off support at its 50-day moving average. That sets up a follow-on entry.In its May 3 report, Vulcan said most of its businesses have rallied and that its customers are winning more construction projects lately. New federal funding for road and bridge projects is aiding the industry. Better weather than last year also helped. In Q2, profits are seen rising 138% to $1 a share.Broadcom (AVGO) is up 39% from its Feb. 11 low. Trading near 151, the stock has pulled back in mostly light volume and is now sitting below its 159.75 entry.Such declines so soon after a breakout are frustrating but also common in an uncertain market, IBD's markets team notes. The low of the pattern undercut the low of a prior shallow base, which served to reset the base count.Broadcom took over LSI Logic in 2014. That gave it access to the networking and storage chip space. In February, Avago completed its acquisition of Broadcom. The company uses Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker.During the fiscal second quarter, the company has been paying off debt by selling its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL) and its internet of things segment to Cypress Semiconductor (CY). Proceeds could help pay for future mergers and acquisitions. On June 13, Nomura raised its price target to 200 from 190. Nomura said the next iPhone benefits Broadcom because it has more components in the new model.Earnings per share popped up 26% in the fiscal second quarter. It gained 15% in the prior quarter. Second-quarter revenues jumped 119%. They grew 8% in the previous stanza.MFS Growth Fund's bets on its best ideas are fairly bold. Its top 10 accounted for nearly 31% of assets as of May 31.Technology was the fund's largest sector, with a 23% weighting. Retailing was second, at 15%. Health care was next, with just under 15%.Managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel had just shy of 97% of their shareholders' money at work in U.S. stocks. Most of the balance was in cash.

119,VMC,"Although one-third of First Trust Materials AlphaDEX ETF (FXZ) is in chemical companies, its most interesting stocks are smaller holdings in the building trades.It's in that batch that investors will find Masco (MAS), Watsco (WSO), Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and other building-supply companies that have become among the best performing in the market today.Masco broke out past a 30.71 buy point in March and is near new highs after finding support at the 50-day moving average. The cabinetry maker's earnings growth ramped up 26%, 61% and 78% the past three quarters. Sales gains have been in single digits, however.Martin Marietta, a provider of asphalt, concrete and other aggregates, has surged more than 75% from its Feb. 9 low. Vulcan, another supplier to the heavy-construction industry, is at multiyear highs after an impressive climb since January. The two are growing thanks to the rise in home construction (April new home sales were at an eight-year high) and new funding for roads and bridges.Watsco has pulled back from its April high, but is holding on to most of its 2016 advance. Valspar (VAL) is another top holding, although the paint maker is being acquired by rival Sherwin-Williams. The stock soared to record highs in March on news of the deal and has been flat since then.Fastenal (FAST), a construction supply retailer, is 3.1% of the total fund. Shares are consolidating but trading below the 50-day moving average.At its core, First Trust Materials is a cyclical-stock play. Its major holdings include Dow Chemical (DOW), Steel Dynamics (STLD), fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS) and paper producer Domtar (UFS). Although some major holdings are well off 52-week highs, it's not that they're all dogs. Dow and Steel Dynamics made big strides earlier in the year.One-third of the ETF is in chemical stocks, about 16% in mining and 15% in packaging. Building and construction companies make up a combined 18%, according to the fund's website.First Trust Materials tracks an enhanced index developed by NYSE Group that selects stocks from the Russell 1000 based on growth factors including three-, six- and 12-month price performance. Sales to price and one year sales growth are other selection factors, as well as certain valuation gauges.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

120,VMC,"Choppy markets can make for frustrating trades. You may buy a stock as it breaks out of a chart pattern, only to see it quickly stall or slip back below the buy point. Then you’re faced with a decision: Sell the stock and move on, or sit tight and give it time to (hopefully) gain traction and climb higher.Here are some guidelines to help answer that question -- and also minimize your chances of getting into that situation in the first place. Scroll down to see examples of how this scenario has played out recently for Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). Be Extra Picky With New Buys In A Choppy MarketVolatile, seesaw markets are much less forgiving than a strong uptrend. So it’s a time to tighten, not loosen, your buy rules. To avoid impulse buys and make sure you have sound reasons for the trade, make each stock pass a Buying Checklist before you invest. Avoid Buying A Stock Just Before EarningsOne of the quickest ways to get into trouble is to buy a stock that breaks out just before it reports its latest earnings. If that’s your initial position, you’re in a precarious situation since you don’t have enough time to establish a profit cushion to soften the blow if the stock heads south after reporting. Set A Defensive Sell Price When You BuyIt’s not unusual for a stock to break out, then pull back to or just below the buy point, especially in a choppy market.So first make sure the stock passes your investing criteria, then set a defensive sell price. If the stock triggers that price, sell. If the stock does not trigger your exit price, give it time to find its footing and climb higher.As a general rule, always sell if a stock drops 7% - 8% below what you paid for it. Depending on how the market and the stock is acting, you may set a tighter stop at, say, a 3% - 4% loss.Check Volume & Key Support LevelsWhen a stock pulls back, always see if the volume is above or below average. A mild, post-breakout pullback in light trading is one thing. A sharp drop in unusually heavy volume is quite another. Also look for signs of support at key benchmarks, such as the most recent buy point or the 10-day or 50-day moving averages. Here again, having patience is key. If you had sound reasons for making the purchase and the stock is finding support after a pullback in light volume, sit tight and give the stock time to climb. (Possible exception: If you bought just before a stock reports earnings -- which is risky -- and you don't have a profit cushion ahead of the report, you may want to reduce your exposure.)Checking the weekly chart can also help put the daily fluctuations in perspective and give a better view of longer term trends and support.

127,VMC,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

128,VMC,"A major theme of this year’s presidential campaign is how candidates plan to improve the nation's employment picture, and one idea espoused by almost everyone from Donald Trump to Sen. Bernie Sanders is to create jobs through a massive program to improve the nation’s infrastructure.Much of the work will go toward rebuilding and upgrading highways, bridges, tunnels and rail lines. On the federal level, a transportation bill has passed allocating $305 billion to repair and expand highways, bridges and mass transit over the next five years. Many states and municipalities have also passed or proposed legislation to improve infrastructure.This is all good news for Vulcan Materials (VMC), which supplies aggregates -- rocks, gravel and sand to the layman -- as well as asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete to the paving and construction industries.The company’s stock price has been trading near multiyear highs this month, in part because of anticipation over how infrastructure projects will impact demand for its products. Many analysts reckon Vulcan shares can keep pushing higher in coming months.“Increased highway construction awards and an expansion of state (transportation) budgets could act as a catalyst for the stock,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall wrote in a recent report to clients.Analyst Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson offers a similar view. ""It certainly doesn’t hurt that there’s federal support in terms of infrastructure projects. This creates enthusiasm for the stock,” Thielman told IBD.Vulcan has already gotten a lift from rebounding construction markets in the private sector, he says. With more spending on public works, the company stands to gain even more.“They’ve seen pretty solid growth on the volume side for their core aggregates product line, in conjunction with accelerating pricing throughout 2015,” Thielman said. “The main driver behind volume growth is strong construction industry fundamentals in the private sector, and now we’re seeing a little momentum developing on the public side.”On the private construction side, Vulcan and peers such as Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Eagle Materials (EXP) and U.S. Concrete (USCR) have gotten a lift from a rebounding housing market in the U.S.Housing starts last year reached their highest level since 2007, according to the Census Bureau.Meanwhile, commercial construction -- where Vulcan gets most of its business -- has also picked up steam over the last year or so. Nonresidential construction spending “greatly exceeded” expectations in 2015, according to a survey from the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and should continue to see healthy growth over the next couple of years.Overall nonresidential construction spending is expected to grow 8.3% year-over-year in 2016, the AIA said, led by double-digit gains in the hotel, office and industrial sectors. Spending is seen rising another 6.7% in 2017.“While rising interest rates could pose a challenge to the U.S. economy, lower energy prices, improved employment figures and an enacted federal budget for 2016 are all factoring into a very favorable outlook for the construction industry,” AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker said in a statement. “And after several years of challenging economic circumstances, the institutional project sector is finally on very solid footing.”These favorable trends are reflected in Vulcan’s recent financial performance. The company’s annual earnings in 2015 more than doubled from the prior year, and that was on top of an even bigger gain in 2014. Annual revenue grew 14% in 2015 -- the biggest increase in at least eight years.Vulcan earned 74 cents a share during the fourth quarter of 2015. That was up from 31 cents the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 60 cents. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by 830 basis points to 35.1%, led by increased profitability in the company’s aggregates segment.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Vulcan to grow full-year earnings by 51% in 2016 and by another 37% in 2017.“On the expense side, lower costs for diesel fuel and less spending on both repairs and maintenance and overtime labor contributed to a 3% year-over-year decline in aggregates unit costs,” Wetenhall noted. ""The combination of stronger volumes, higher selling prices and lower unit costs was the primary driver of strong incremental margin performance.”Fourth-quarter revenue grew 14% to $857.3 million, also above views, helped by higher prices. It was the fifth straight quarter of double-digit gains on the top line.Same-store shipments for the quarter climbed more than 8% in the company’s aggregates segment, 4% in its asphalt segment, and 2% in its concrete segment.For the full year, Vulcan shipped 178 million tons of aggregates, which was slightly above its mid-year forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% from 2014.“All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth,” Chief Executive Tom Hill said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. He expects even greater volume in coming years.“We are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal mid-cycle level of shipments,” Hill said on the call. “We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow.”

Net sales excluding shipping and delivery revenue jumped 41% to $850.2 million, below Wall Street's $924.2 million target.But gross profit margin rose 100 basis points to 23.5% on tight cost controls.Management noted that this last winter was the second wettest in more than 100 years, delaying some of its customers' construction projects and resulting in nearly $100 million deferred net sales.""As we look at the remainder of 2015 and into 2016,"" CEO Ward Nye said in a statement, ""contractor backlogs and other macro-economic indicators underscore the pent-up demand for our products, and that should allow us to capture delayed shipments in future quarters.""Because of the delays, the company now sees aggregates shipments rising 7%-10% in 2015 compared with 2014 levels, down from its earlier forecast for 10%-12% growth.Martin Marietta competes in the building material group with Vulcan and gypsum wallboard and cement product maker Eagle Materials (EXP).Martin Marietta's stock was trading near an eight-year high of 160.84 set on July 22, extended above its 50-day moving average and its 10-week line.

169,VMC,"All built up with a game-changing buy, Martin Marietta Materials has laid the groundwork for a healthy growth spurt amid upbeat prospects for its end markets in construction materials.
"
170,VMC,"Martin Marietta (MLM) is a major supplier of aggregates — crushed stone, sand and gravel — and heavy building materials for the construction industry, including infrastructure, nonresidential and residential applications.
"
171,VMC,"The company, which is highly rated by IBD, gave its business a nice jolt when it acquired Texas Industries in July. As a stand-alone entity, TXI, as it is called, was the largest producer of cement in Texas and a major cement producer in California. It was also a top supplier of construction aggregate, ready-mix concrete and concrete products.
"
172,VMC,"TXI's shareholders received 0.70 Martin Marietta share for each share of TXI common stock. The transaction is valued at about $2.7 billion, including the assumption of $0.7 billion of TXI debt.
"
173,VMC,"The deal created a leading supplier of aggregate products and heavy building materials and vaulted Martin Marietta's position in its markets in various ways, the company says.
"
174,VMC,"Martin Marietta became the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates and the largest producer of cement in Texas. The buy also increased Martin Marietta's presence in the Southwest, with cement production facilities concentrated primarily in Texas and California, two of the largest and fastest growing markets for construction materials in the U.S.
"
175,VMC,"'Transformational' Acquisition
"
176,VMC,"Stephens analyst Trey Grooms describes the the TXI buyout as ""transformational.""
"
177,VMC,"He says prior to the buy Martin Marietta was primarily an aggregate company in stone, gravel and sand.
"
178,VMC,"""The TXI acquisition got them into more downstream integration in concrete and asphalt, and it also got them into cement in a big way,"" he told IBD.
"
179,VMC,"Martin Marietta is now the No. 1 producer of cement in Texas, Grooms adds, and the TXI acquisition got the company into that leading position.
"
180,VMC,"With TXI in the mix, Texas is Martin Marietta's largest market, Grooms says. He estimates it now represents about 35% of the company's annual sales vs. about 20% prior to the buy.
"
181,VMC,"The buy has given Martin Marietta a lift in revenue and profit as well as generating cost synergies.
"
182,VMC,"Martin Marietta showed just how beneficial the TXI buy has been when it posted impressive fourth-quarter results on Feb. 10.
"
183,VMC,"The company's adjusted Q4 earnings rose 27% to 99 cents a share, handily topping analyst views for 82 cents in a poll by Thomson Reuters. Total revenue leapt 57% to $856.3 million.
"
184,VMC,"Consolidated net sales increased 59% to $779.5 million, well ahead of forecasts for $772.78 million.
"
185,VMC,"""Our strong foundation, bolstered by the acquisition of (TXI), has us well-positioned to continue delivering increased shareholder value as we serve the rising demand for building materials,"" said CEO Ward Nye in a statement.
"
186,VMC,"TXI-related realized synergies accelerated in the fourth quarter, making the transaction accretive for the year, said Nye. The company expects to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016 resulting from the TXI buy, more than 40% greater than its previous guidance.
"
187,VMC,"For the second half of 2014, the company achieved synergies of $27 million, 50% higher than original expectations.
"
188,VMC,"""They reported a beat across the board, primarily driven by higher aggregates gross margins and better synergies from the TXI deal,"" Grooms said.
"
189,VMC,"He says the growth in the quarter was driven by an increase in Martin Marietta's heritage, or legacy, aggregates volume of 7.6% vs. a year earlier. Legacy aggregates' pricing was up 6%. He says cement pricing increased by 16%, primarily driven by price increases put in place in Texas.
"
190,VMC,"""In the fourth quarter, they showed they are delivering on some of the promises they made (about the TXI acquisition),"" D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Brent Thielman told IBD. ""To the extent they said it's going to be accretive in the first year, they achieved it in the (fourth) quarter.""
"
191,VMC,"Share Buybacks
"
192,VMC,"In reporting results, the company announced it has authorized a new share repurchase program under which it may acquire up to 20 million shares of its outstanding common stock. The authorization includes the 5 million shares authorized under the company's previous repurchase program.
"
193,VMC,"Investors cheered Martin Marietta's strong Feb. 10 report. Its stock price closed up 15.17% that day. Its stock has vaulted close to 30% so far this year.
"
194,VMC,"Why the enthusiasm?
"
195,VMC,"""The stock had gotten beaten up, going from 130 at the end of November to close to 100 by mid-December on fears that the pullback in oil prices would put the brakes on Texas demand,"" Grooms said.
"
196,VMC,"Its shares hovered around 105 in January. Then came the strong Feb. 10 report.
"
197,VMC,"""Their bullishness around pricing, their optimistic outlook for demand in Texas, and good guidance (in the fourth-quarter report) is what drove the stock up. The announced stock repurchase is another primary driver for the stock-price recovery.""
"
198,VMC,"Thielman adds that one of the concerns heading into the quarter was the decline in oil prices, which ""raised some fears"" about what would happen to the company in the Texas market.
"
199,VMC,"""They showed in the quarter that they see fairly good visibility in that market,"" he said. ""That doesn't eliminate the risk down the road if oil prices stay low.""
"
200,VMC,"Also in the fourth quarter, the company showed that the TXI integration process is going well, he adds, and ""there seems to be opportunities in front of them.""
"
201,VMC,"Analysts expect 2015 earnings to jump 39% to $5.20 a share. They see a 36% gain in 2016 and a 40% increase in 2017.
"
202,VMC,"Construction Tailwinds
"
203,VMC,"""We're starting to see some more volume momentum in the aggregates business, and there are some construction market tailwinds within the company that are helping drive better profitability,"" Thielman said.
"
204,VMC,"The tailwinds, he adds, include the start of more nonresidential construction activity such as building roads and highways, which is a ""significant driver of heavy-materials demand.""
"
205,VMC,"In giving its 2015 outlook, Martin Marietta management noted positive trends in its business and markets: Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors, the company said, noting the Dodge Momentum Index is at its highest level since 2009 and ""signals continued growth.""
"
206,VMC,"""Residential construction is expected to continue to grow, driven by historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, employment gains, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption, higher multifamily rental rates and rising housing prices,"" the company said.

The Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing Group is approaching a new high after rebounding off its 10-week line. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which makes chips for mobile devices, leads the 43-stock group with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. It's well extended from a buy range. Investors should wait for…
"
209,VMC,"After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.
"
210,VMC,"Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction. Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.
"
211,VMC,"Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.
"
212,VMC,"The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way. Earnings have climbed by at least double-digit percentages in all but one of the past 11 quarters.
"
213,VMC,"Foray Into Fracking Sand
"
214,VMC,"Newly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.
"
215,VMC,"Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.
"
216,VMC,"Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.
"
217,VMC,"With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.
"
218,VMC,"D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman is upbeat about Eagle's prospects in oil and gas proppants, which Eagle started to report as a separate operating segment beginning in fiscal 2015.
"
219,VMC,"""They've talked about this business being as large as their cement or wallboard business,"" he said. ""It will take a few years to get there, but over time, it will be a third leg to the stool. That's the key message. They truly believe it will be a meaningful platform for them. The growth opportunity is pretty significant.""
"
220,VMC,"On the first-quarter conference call, Eagle CEO Steven Rowley said that the new Oil and Gas Proppants segment ""will be increasing in importance in coming years.""
"
221,VMC,"He also noted that he expects the frac-sand business to ""become a material contributor to Eagle's cash flow by the end of this fiscal year.""
"
222,VMC,"Adds Thielman: ""For the immediate (second) quarter, I don't expect tremendous momentum for the proppants business. In the second half, it will become a more meaningful contributor.""
"
223,VMC,"Drillers Spur Demand
"
224,VMC,"The nation's shale boom has caused a surge in demand for frac sand. In addition to Eagle, other frac sand producers include U.S. Silica (SLCA) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP).
"
225,VMC,"Thielman says the demand for frac sand is strong and the growth profiles of the companies that produce it are ""pretty significant.""
"
226,VMC,"Meanwhile, Eagle continues to enjoy a nice lift from an uptick in homebuilding demand.
"
227,VMC,"The company is the fifth largest by market cap of nine in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, after Cemex (CX), CRH (CRH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). The group ranks No. 134 of 197 tracked, and Eagle stock is up 34% so far this year.
"
228,VMC,"Eagle's first-quarter earnings rose 25% from a year earlier to 75 cents a share. Revenue increased 17% to $266.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year fiscal 2015 earnings rising 49% to $3.72 a share. They expect a 45% increase in fiscal 2016.
"
229,VMC,"Improved prices in all businesses helped first-quarter sales.
"
230,VMC,"The results ""reflect improving, early-cycle construction fundamentals in the U.S.,"" the company said in a press release.
"
231,VMC,"""Their building-products business looks pretty brisk, and they feel pretty optimistic heading into the second half of the calendar year,"" Thielman said.
"
232,VMC,"Eagle's wallboard business has done well year-to-date with good volume growth, he adds. He says that business is benefiting from being concentrated in some relatively strong housing markets, citing Texas and Colorado in particular.
"
233,VMC,"""The primary drivers"" of the first-quarter earnings gain were increased wallboard and paperboard sales volumes, the company said.
"
234,VMC,"The wallboard and paperboard segment's operating earnings climbed 27% from a year earlier to $45 million in the first quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $136.1 million, helped by an 11% rise in gypsum wallboard prices.

235,VMC,"Operating earnings from Eagle's cement business were up 8% to $20.5 million. Average sales prices rose 5% from a year earlier, though they were partially offset by $5.2 million in costs related to a shift to the first quarter of the annual maintenance outages at its Kansas City, Mo. and Tulsa, Okla., facilities.

238,VMC,"Homebuilding Outlook Mixed
"
239,VMC,"While homebuilding has rebounded from its slump after the U.S. housing market crashed, it hasn't reached anywhere near the high levels of the housing boom.
"
240,VMC,"Single-family starts peaked in 2005, reaching 1.7 million that year, according to the NAHB. In the wake of harsh weather patterns in the first quarter of 2014 that slowed construction demand, the NAHB expects this year to end with 649,000 single-family housing starts, up just 4.5% from a year earlier. But it forecasts that single-family housing starts will rise 34.8% to 875,000 in 2015. It sees a 34% gain in 2016 to 1.173 million.
"
241,VMC,"Melman says demand is strong for Eagle's gypsum wallboard and should stay there, though its margins could possibly get ""squeezed a little if it can't get price increases.""
"
242,VMC,"One gauge of the homebuilding outlook is the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.
"
243,VMC,"Builder confidence in the market for newly built, single-family homes rose two points to 55 on the index for August. This third consecutive monthly gain brings the index to its highest level since January.
"
244,VMC,"""Each of the three components of the index registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a statement. ""Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand.""After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction. Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way. Earnings have climbed by at least double-digit percentages in all but one of the past 11 quarters.Foray Into Fracking SandNewly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman is upbeat about Eagle's prospects in oil and gas proppants, which Eagle started to report as a separate operating segment beginning in fiscal 2015.""They've talked about this business being as large as their cement or wallboard business,"" he said. ""It will take a few years to get there, but over time, it will be a third leg to the stool. That's the key message. They truly believe it will be a meaningful platform for them. The growth opportunity is pretty significant.""On the first-quarter conference call, Eagle CEO Steven Rowley said that the new Oil and Gas Proppants segment ""will be increasing in importance in coming years.""He also noted that he expects the frac-sand business to ""become a material contributor to Eagle's cash flow by the end of this fiscal year.""Adds Thielman: ""For the immediate (second) quarter, I don't expect tremendous momentum for the proppants business. In the second half, it will become a more meaningful contributor.""Drillers Spur DemandThe nation's shale boom has caused a surge in demand for frac sand. In addition to Eagle, other frac sand producers include U.S. Silica (SLCA) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP).Thielman says the demand for frac sand is strong and the growth profiles of the companies that produce it are ""pretty significant.""Meanwhile, Eagle continues to enjoy a nice lift from an uptick in homebuilding demand.The company is the fifth largest by market cap of nine in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, after Cemex (CX), CRH (CRH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). The group ranks No. 134 of 197 tracked, and Eagle stock is up 34% so far this year.Eagle's first-quarter earnings rose 25% from a year earlier to 75 cents a share. Revenue increased 17% to $266.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year fiscal 2015 earnings rising 49% to $3.72 a share. They expect a 45% increase in fiscal 2016.Improved prices in all businesses helped first-quarter sales.The results ""reflect improving, early-cycle construction fundamentals in the U.S.,"" the company said in a press release.""Their building-products business looks pretty brisk, and they feel pretty optimistic heading into the second half of the calendar year,"" Thielman said.Eagle's wallboard business has done well year-to-date with good volume growth, he adds. He says that business is benefiting from being concentrated in some relatively strong housing markets, citing Texas and Colorado in particular.""The primary drivers"" of the first-quarter earnings gain were increased wallboard and paperboard sales volumes, the company said.The wallboard and paperboard segment's operating earnings climbed 27% from a year earlier to $45 million in the first quarter.

264,VMC,"Don't mistake $1.2 billion Fidelity Trend's approach as a growth-at-a-reasonable-price fund.Manager Dan Kelley prefers to describe his fund as looking for companies whose growth is underestimated by Wall Street analysts.Kelley favors three types of growth stocks:Stable earnings growers.Companies on a hot streak, with high sustainable growth for many years.Opportunistic growers, which have low valuations but are near a point when a catalyst sparks a growth spurt.Google (GOOG), Monsanto (MON) and Visa (V) are examples of stable growers. Michael Kors (KORS) is in his high sustainable growth bucket, as he puts it.  Manitowoc (MTW), new to the fund as of its latest disclosure, and United Technologies (UTX) are opportunistic growers.Those latter two stocks benefit from the rally in nonresidential construction, Kelley says. Manitowoc sells cranes and lifting equipment. United sells elevators and heating systems.Other holdings also sell into the construction space.  Ingersoll-Rand (IR) makes climate control systems. Wesco (WCC) distributes industrial and electrical construction, maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Vulcan Materials (VMC) makes construction aggregates.""Nonresidential construction tends to lag residential by 12 to 18 months, so this space is right in a sweet spot,"" Kelley said.The ongoing rebound in residential housing benefits materials and tools sellers. The fund held Lowes (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) as of its latest disclosure.""As home sales improve, people feel more comfortable adding or refurbishing rooms or taking care of deferred repairs in existing homes too,"" Kelley said.Kelley's CredentialsThose areas are familiar to Kelley. Before taking the reins of Trend in January last year, at various times he has served as research analyst covering REITs and homebuilder stocks as well as manager of Select Construction & Housing along with other duties. He now runs four portfolios in all.Another trend Kelley has played is refurbished auto parts. He owned LKQ (LKQ) as of his latest disclosure.""Insurers are looking to lower auto claims expenses, so they're utilizing more refurbished parts. LKQ owns junk and scrap yards, where they get parts refurbished and recertified,"" Kelley said.Barriers To EntryThe field has grown fast and has barriers to entry. ""They have a distribution network of hubs across the U.S. that can get parts to mechanics and repair shops,"" he said.The fund was up 6.86% this year going into Tuesday. Its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged 7.63%. The S&P 500 was up 10.24%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual return is 11.33% vs. 9.19% for its peers and 11.29% for the big-cap bogey.The fund's first-quarter relative performance trailed the S&P 500 as many investors shifted into defensive names and stronger yield payers. Rather than make such moves, Kelley continued to pursue growth. ""I stuck to my philosophy and process,"" he said.Kelley trimmed Apple (AAPL) in recent months.

One that put in a nice gain was cement and concrete producers. That middle-of-the-pack group was boosted by a 15% surge by Vulcan Materials (VMC), a stock with poor earnings and sales records.Big caps proved no haven from the broad selling. Names like  Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C), Halliburton (HAL), Bank of America (BAC) and Apache (APA) all lost 4% to 7%, although volume for each came in below average.One active issue, Intel (INTC), fell 4% in fast trade.

269,VMC,"Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.87%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, which more than offset the earnings misses. This resulted in an average earnings beat of 0.41%.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise  Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise | Vulcan Materials Company Quote Vulcan is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located in the open. Inclement weather conditions affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute products as well as demand.Aggregates shipments declined 2% in the first six months of 2017 owing to adverse weather conditions. The recent hurricanes will likely cause shipment delays in the third quarter. Nevertheless, increased demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties will likely offset the initial concerns regarding business delays.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for aggregates shipments is pegged at 50, 776 tons for the third quarter, up 1% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Vulcan this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is -7.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vulcan has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Earnings estimates for the third quarter have moved down 15.4% over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concerns. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a decline of 7.7% year over year.Nonetheless, the company’s aggressive cost-control initiatives, strong aggregate reserve position and pricing power are likely to drive results in the third quarter. Also, sustained growth in private construction activity is expected to bode well for demand of both the aggregates and non-aggregates business lines. For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.06 billion, up 4.7% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few construction stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to beat earnings.Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.36% and a Zacks Rank #1.

270,VMC,"Investors with an interest in Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates stocks have likely encountered both Pacasmayo (CPAC  -  Free Report) and Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Pacasmayo and Vulcan Materials are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CPAC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.CPAC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.34, while VMC has a forward P/E of 29.19. We also note that CPAC has a PEG ratio of 0.71. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. VMC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39.Another notable valuation metric for CPAC is its P/B ratio of 2.10. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, VMC has a P/B of 3.50.These metrics, and several others, help CPAC earn a Value grade of B, while VMC has been given a Value grade of D.CPAC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CPAC is likely the superior value option right now.

This Miami-based homebuilder surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 7.1%.Notably, Lennar’s diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, and positive housing market fundamentals prove favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States.Factors at PlayAlthough higher prices, mortgage rates and supply shortages are taking a toll on the housing industry of late, Lennar has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 89.3% of total revenues) of $4.7 billion are likely to increase from $2.9 billion in the year-ago period and $2.7 billion recorded in the prior reported quarter. This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog. The company’s new order trend (in units) also remained solid, growing 30% in the last reported quarter and 11% in fiscal 2017.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovation of new products such as recently announced creative student-loan program. The company expects the segment’s second-quarter profit to be between $45 million and $48 million for the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $288 million, reflecting 68.4% sequential growth.While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under considerable pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. While labor shortages are resulting in higher wages, land prices are increasing due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales expanded 50 basis points (bps) in the fiscal first quarter but decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. For the second quarter, the company expects gross margin to be in the 21.0-21.6% range compared with 21.1% in the year-ago period. Gross margins are expected to be impacted by 750-800 bps in the second quarter related to the CalAtlantic acquisition.Overall, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve operating efficiency via digital-marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder. In this regard, the company is working hard to improve its SG&A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted 60 bps to 9.7% in the fiscal first quarter, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries. However, the impact of purchase accounting related to CalAtlantic acquisition is expected to hurt margins and thereby the bottom line of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents, reflecting a decrease of 50.6% year over year. That said, the same for revenues is pegged at $5.23 billion, implying 60.4% growth.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Lennar does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

272,VMC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates sector might want to consider either Pacasmayo (CPAC  -  Free Report) or Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Pacasmayo has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Vulcan Materials has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that CPAC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CPAC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.59, while VMC has a forward P/E of 29.21. We also note that CPAC has a PEG ratio of 0.72. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. VMC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39.Another notable valuation metric for CPAC is its P/B ratio of 2.13. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, VMC has a P/B of 3.49.These metrics, and several others, help CPAC earn a Value grade of B, while VMC has been given a Value grade of D.CPAC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than VMC, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CPAC is the superior option right now.

273,VMC,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing, with 54% of the S&P 500 members having reported their results. Per the Earnings Preview  dated Oct 27, approximately 75.7% surpassed earnings, while 66.2% beat revenues. Notably, earnings for these companies have risen 8.7% from the same period last year, with 6.7% revenue growth.For the third quarter, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to grow 5.4% year over year on 5.5% rise in revenues.A Look at the Construction SectorThe overall outlook for the construction market is positive. Factors like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer sentiments raise optimism over the sector’s performance. Total third-quarter earnings for the construction sector are projected to increase 9% year over year on 10.1% growth in revenues.Historically, the building product industry within the construction sector has been facing the brunt of abnormally wet weather conditions, which have jeopardized shipments, production and profits. The recent hurricanes are also likely to cause shipment delays in the short term. Nevertheless, demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties is expected to somewhat offset the initial concerns regarding business delays, boosting the top line for these companies.Again, the U.S. construction market in 2017 is expected to get a boost if, as announced, the Trump administration invests heavily in infrastructure. Particularly, Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure by rebuilding highways along with bridges, tunnels, airports, schools and hospitals have brought building product stocks under the limelight.Building Product Stocks Reporting on Nov 2Two building product companies — Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) and Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) — are set to report third-quarter results on Nov 1, before market opens. Let's see how things are shaping up for their announcements.Martin Marietta’s prospects have been getting marred by weak volumes since 2016 due to labor constraints and delays in large projects. Weather-related risks have been affecting the company’s performance due to the exterior nature of its business despite improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency. Meanwhile, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to weigh on its second-half 2017 results as Martin Marietta generates 39% of its sales from Texas and Florida. The impact of the hurricanes is likely to lead to weak volumes, negative price/mix along with higher operating costs.Nonetheless, the company’s string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private and public construction activity are encouraging. Sustained growth in construction activity drives demand for the aggregates and cement businesses of the company. This is expected to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.47, reflecting a 0.8% year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.06 billion, reflecting 2.3% growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as Martin Marietta does not have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3, combined with a positive Earnings ESP, have higher chances of beating earnings estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -1.62%. Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

Inclement weather conditions affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute products as well as demand.Aggregates shipments declined 2% in the first six months of 2017 owing to adverse weather conditions. The recent hurricanes will likely cause shipment delays in the third quarter. Nevertheless, increased demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties will likely offset the initial concerns regarding business delays.

274,VMC,"Acquisitions have been integral to Vulcan Materials’ (VMC  -  Free Report) growth strategy. The company strengthened its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures that are expected to facilitate the company in driving profitability.The company’s shares have gained 12.7% in the past three months, comparing favorably with the industry’s 3.8% increase. Again, earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 2.8% north over the past 60 days. This upside reflects analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential. The company’s strong aggregate reserve position and bolt-on acquisitions should also drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Expansion via AcquisitionsSince becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan Materials followed a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that had contributed significantly to its growth. Vulcan Materials closed acquisitions totaling $226 million in 2017.During the first quarter of 2018, the company closed three acquisitions, including aggregates and asphalt operations, complementing its existing positions in Alabama and Texas.   Importantly, the company made an important integration of Aggregates USA, LLC for $900 million into its portfolio in early 2018. With this addition, Vulcan will serve high-growth markets across the Southeastern United States comprising states of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia.The company will largely benefit from the state highway funding programs in these areas and also from consistent private-sector growth in the region. Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of Aggregates USA operations, is envisioned in the range of $1.15-$1.25 billion. Aggregates shipments from Aggregates USA operations are expected to be roughly 7 million tons.These buyouts boost Vulcan's ability to serve customers well, and draw in operational and commercial synergies.Meanwhile, the company divested its Georgia ready-mix concrete operations in March.Efforts to Boost Aggregate Reserve PositionVulcan Materials invested $64.4 million in internal growth projects in the first quarter to secure new aggregates reserves, develop new production sites, enhance distribution capabilities, and support the targeted growth of asphalt and concrete operations.The company also has plans to spend $350 million through 2018 for internal growth, including the development of strategic aggregates sites in California and Texas.Trump’s Infrastructure Plan Will Act as CatalystPrivate demand, both residential and non-residential, continues to recover across the Vulcan-served markets, and highway demand is again on the surge after 2017 had been disappointing.Importantly, Trump unveiled the long-awaited $1.5 trillion plan to fix America’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. The plan is primarily centered around using the $200 billion in federal funds to spur massive infrastructure investments in roads, highways, ports and airports.The comprehensive bill will also address issues related to drinking and waste-water system, energy and rural infrastructure, as well as veterans’ hospitals, to name a few. This will further propel demand for products sold by companies like Vulcan Materials.Overall, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects adjusted earnings to grow 30-50% for 2018. Also, it will remain focused on building aggregates’ unit margins and executing internal-growth projects.HeadwindsVulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. The company’s production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products. It also has a negative impact on demand, as construction work can be hampered by weather. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Construction sector are M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Earnings improved considerably by 65.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 38 cents. The upside can be attributed to higher oriented strand board (OSB) prices and the strong performances in engineered wood products and South American operations.

282,VMC,"Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.87%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average earnings beat being 5.23%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayVulcan Material’s systematic inorganic strategy for expansion looks encouraging. The company has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that contributed significantly to its growth. In the first nine months of 2017, it closed acquisitions worth $212.4 million. These include ready-mixed concrete facilities, an aggregates marine distribution yard and building materials yards from California, two aggregates facilities from Illinois, an aggregates facility from New Mexico as well as two aggregates facilities, asphalt mix operations and a construction-paving business from Tennessee. These buyouts are expected to drive growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Coming to the segments, Aggregates segment sales (accounting for more than 78% of total revenues) will rise 6.8% in the quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Last quarter, segment sales increased 4.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for aggregates shipments is pegged at 44.3 billion tons, showing an improvement of 2.8% year over year.In the previous quarter, Asphalt Mix segment revenues improved 20.6% year over year . In the fourth quarter, revenues are expected to grow 6.5% year over year, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Concrete segment revenues are projected to rise 16.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Revenues increased 26.8% in the last quarter. Also, Calcium segment revenues are likely to be down 3.4% in the to-be-reported quarter. Revenues declined 14.7% in the prior quarter.Moreover, an improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well. As a result, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products is likely to rise, which will drive revenues.However, seasonal influences on construction activity can weigh on the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Vulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $936.5 million, up 7.3% year over year. Earnings are estimated at 72 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of 4.4% year.Quantitative Model PredictionPer our proven model, Vulcan Materials is likely to deliver an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.

287,VMC,"Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report) is a construction sector stock I've been talking and writing about -- and trading -- for many years since I grew up in a rural county that was rich in gravel and they were the primary excavator of aggregate for roads and cement.Growing up in Crystal Lake, Illinois, we swam and fished in the ""gravel pits"" that other states might call a quarry.While shares have soared 10% in the past 7 trading sessions -- even surging on the first day of 2018 to a new 6-month high -- analysts continue to lower earnings estimates, keeping VMC in the cellar of the Zacks Rank.To give you an idea of the EPS slide, over two months ago the consensus for 2018 earnings slipped from $4.72 to $4.19.While that estimate drop was clearly absorbed in a strong economy expecting government infrastructure stimulus at some point, in the past 30 days, the Zacks consensus dropped again from $4.08 to $3.99, pushing VMC back down to a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell.Clearly, the analysts see something that is less optimistic about the business and they continue to grow softer on the outlook.And trading over 32 times that forward EPS estimate -- as if it were a Tech stock -- shares may have trouble getting over the big weekly resistance level around $135.Digging for the Aggregate PictureOne of the best ways to see the ""aggregate"" views of Wall Street for Vulcan over time is the proprietary Zacks Price & Consensus chart.What you see below are the changes in the annual EPS estimate consensus...Vulcan may have an earnings turn-around in 2018, but right now we have no evidence of that coming down the pike. Estimates seem to always start out overly optimistic and then get lowered as the quarters pass and reality sets in.And maybe a federal infrastructure bill is already priced-in. We have no reason to believe otherwise given analyst sentiment.Until we have more evidence, best to stay on the side of the road with Vulcan.The Zacks Rank will let you know when the potholes are getting repaired in the VMC outlook.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

288,VMC,"Vulcan Materials Company’s (VMC  -  Free Report) bolt-on acquisitions, strong aggregate reserve position and improvement in private construction activities are encouraging.The company follows a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions. The company has closed acquisitions totaling $212 million so far this year.In the first quarter of 2017, the company took over facilities, a marine aggregates distribution yard and building materials yards in California. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, it acquired an aggregates facility, asphalt mix operations, an asphalt paving business and a rail-served aggregates operation. In the second quarter of 2017, the company signed an agreement with SPO Partners to buy the latter’s aggregates business — Aggregates USA LLC. These buyouts expand its ability to serve customers well and bring in operational and commercial synergies. In 2016, Vulcan expanded its aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas.Moreover, an improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well as sustained growth in private construction activity drives demand for aggregates as well as non-aggregates businesses of Vulcan Materials.     Positives like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector’s performance. As such, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products should rise as well, thereby driving revenues.Also, a strong aggregates business is a major positive for Vulcan Materials. The company is the largest producer of construction aggregates in the United States, possessing the largest proven and probable reserve base in the country. Importantly, the aggregates industry is characterized by high barriers to entry as there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates, thus placing Vulcan Materials favorably.Inclement Weather HurtsSeasonal influences on construction activity weigh heavily on the company’s performance. Inclement weather conditions affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute products as its production and distribution facilities are located outdoors.In the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results. Operations in key Southeastern markets, particularly Florida and Georgia, as well as coastal markets in Texas and along the central Gulf Coast were disrupted.  Aggregates shipments were lowered by at least 1.5 million tons during the quarter. Apart from the immediate impact of the storms, labor market disruptions, haul truck shortages and other logistical challenges continue to trouble. Overall, aggregates shipments declined 1% in the first nine months of 2017.Bad weather conditions and below-trend shipment growth led to a 4.9% decline in Vulcan Materials’ shares this year, wider than the industry’s fall of 2.4%. Nevertheless, we expect rebuilding efforts owing to the hurricanes along with a rise in private construction activities to boost demand for Vulcan Materials’ products in 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings calls for an improvement of 6.9% in 2017 and 33.4% in 2018.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderVulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc (AWI  -  Free Report). All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

290,VMC,"Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.8%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average earnings beat being 10.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Vulcan’s results in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to shipment delays. Vulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products. It also has a negative impact on demand as construction work can be hampered by weather. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Weak Top-Line GrowthThough adverse weather conditions is expected to mar growth  prospects in the quarter, Vulcan’s various bolt-on acquisitions can be expected to provide some cushion to revenues. Moreover, improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well. As a result, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products is likely to rise, which will drive revenues.Coming to the segments, Aggregates segment sales (accounting for more than 78% of total revenues) will fall 1.5% in the quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nevertheless, in the first quarter, revenues are expected to grow 26% year over year in the asphalt segment, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Concrete segment revenues are projected to rise 10% in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, Calcium segment revenues are likely to be up 5.8% in the to-be-reported quarter.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $798.6 million, up  1.4% year over year.Earnings to DeclineIncreased cost that includes freight distribution costs, rise in the unit cost of diesel fuel and storm-related costs is anticipated to hurt margins. The tepid sales growth along with increased costs is likely to dent earnings. Earnings are estimated at 22 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 34.3%.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteQuantitative Model PredictionPer our proven model, Vulcan Materials will not beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is +2.68%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vulcan has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

291,VMC,"Acquisitions have been integral to Vulcan Materials’ (VMC  -  Free Report) growth strategy. After its conversion into a public company in 1957, the company has ever since wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions, which contributed significantly to its growth.In 2017, Vulcan closed a series of acquisitions totaling $226 million. These buyouts include ready-mixed concrete facilities, an aggregates marine distribution yard and building materials yards in California, an aggregates rail distribution yard in Florida and another in South Carolina, three aggregates facilities and 14 aggregates rail distribution yards in Georgia and an asphalt mix operations as well as a construction paving business in Tennessee.In the beginning of 2018, the company made an important integration of Aggregates USA, LLC for $900 million into its portfolio. With this addition, Vulcan will serve high-growth markets across the Southeastern United States comprising states of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia.The company will largely benefit from state highway funding programs in these areas and also from consistent private sector growth in the region. Adjusted EBITDA including the impact of Aggregates USA operations, is envisioned in the range of $1.15-$1.25 billion. Aggregates shipments from Aggregates USA operations are expected to be roughly 7 million tons.These buyouts boost Vulcan's ability to serve customers well and draw in operational and commercial synergies.Meanwhile, the company also resorts to divesting its assets from time to time. In 2017, Vulcan swapped ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona for an asphalt mix operation in the same place, thus resulting in a pretax gain of $8.02 million. Also, as required by the Department of Justice, the company immediately divested certain assets obtained in the Aggregates USA acquisition. It sold 17 Aggregates USA quarries and other facilities in Tennessee and Virginia to Blue Water Industries LLC for $290 million. Vulcan also sold 13 active quarries and yards plus four inactive quarries.The company’s plans for the rest of 2018 will be to completely capture the synergies derived from the recent consolidations and continue with its disciplined strategy of pursuing bolt-on acquisitions. Also, it will remain focused on building Aggregates’ units margins and executing internal growth projects. Notably, Vulcan expects earnings from continuing operations between $4 and $4.65 per share, a growth of 40% over 2017’s adjusted EPS.Share Price MovementVulcan Materials’ shares have gained 1.8% in the past year, comparing favorably with the industry’s loss of 4.9%. Also, earnings estimates for the current year and the next have moved 9.9% and 10.3% north, respectively, over the last two months. This upside in turn reflects analysts’ optimism on the stock’s prospects. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderVulcan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 17.3% in Q2 compared with 9% in the earlier quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 9.6% (6.8% growth in Q1).Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the sector’s performance in 2017. As such, demand for companies’ products should also increase, thereby driving revenues.So far, some of the leading companies in the housing industry have reported their Q2 results. PulteGroup Inc.’s (PHM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. Also, quarterly earnings reflected a solid 27% year over year jump. PulteGroup’s total revenues of $2.02 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a meager 0.5%.

This resulted in an average earnings beat of 4.24%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.24.Also, Vulcan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.

294,VMC,"Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers before the opening bell on Aug 2.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.87%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, which more than offset the three earnings misses. This resulted in an average earnings beat of 4.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySustained growth in private construction activity is expected to bode well for demand of both the aggregates and non-aggregates business lines. Further, prospects for higher funding levels and easy regulatory environment might prove beneficial for the company with respect to idled projects. Overall, key Vulcan states that make up 77% of its total revenue have significantly increased their highway funding. Again, Texas, Florida and Georgia have made major increases to their funding programs in recent years, raising their highway programs to record levels. This will help the company to boost its revenue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, any slowdown in activity related to weather on some parts of the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic region might impact Vulcan's results.The company’s aggressive cost-control initiatives, strong aggregate reserve position, and pricing power are likely to contribute in the second quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.24 per share, reflecting an increase of 37.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $1.08 billion, implying a 12.8% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vulcan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.

296,VMC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Vulcan Materials is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VMC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 73 cents per share for VMC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VMC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.17% heading into earnings season.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that VMC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Vulcan Materials, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

297,VMC,"Leading producer of construction aggregates in the United States, Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) has been expanding its footprint in the best markets in America via acquisitions. In line with this expansion strategy, Vulcan has acquired Aggregates USA, LLC for $900 million.With this addition, Vulcan will serve high-growth markets throughout the southeastern United States comprising Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia. The company will benefit the most from state highway funding programs in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and on the continued private sector growth across the region.Notably, Vulcan will be able to serve Georgia with three granite quarries, two of which have rail capabilities, thereby expanding its reach in important markets. It will also have 16 rail distribution yards in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.Meanwhile, according to the planned agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Vulcan sold 17 Aggregates USA quarries and other facilities in Tennessee and Virginia to Blue Water Industries LLC for $290 million. The company divested 13 active quarries and yards and four inactive quarries in the Knoxville and Tri-Cities, TN, and Abingdon, VA, areas.Inorganic Drive StrongVulcan has followed a systematic inorganic strategy since becoming a public company in 1956 for expansion. The company has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that had contributed significantly to its growth.In the first nine months of 2017, Vulcan closed acquisitions totaling $212.4 million. These include ready-mixed concrete facilities, an aggregates marine distribution yard and building materials yards from California, two aggregates facilities from Illinois, an aggregates facility from New Mexico, and two aggregates facilities, asphalt mix operations and a construction-paving business from Tennessee.These buyouts boost Vulcan's ability to serve customers and bring in operational and commercial synergies.However, the company is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Inclement weather affects both the company’s ability to produce and distribute products and also the demand, as construction work can be hampered by weather. In the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results.
