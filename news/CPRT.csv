1,CPRT,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has more than doubled the performance of the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 so far this year, going into Thursday. The $3.9 billion fund is up 6.88% vs. 2.56% for the big-cap bogey, according to Morningstar Inc., thanks to leading stocks like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Red Hat (RHT) and GoDaddy (GDDY).Those three stocks happen to be in the technology sector, whose 31% weighting made it the fund's largest sector as of March 31 and the sector with the second biggest overweight vs. the fund's Russell Midcap Growth Index bench mark.Still, the fund has five sectors with weightings of at least 10%. That reflects the midcap fund's diversification. The fund also aims for companies with leading competitive positions, durable business models and an ability to sustain their growth.But the fund's outsize bet on technology has limits. Fund managers Timothy Parton and Felise Agranoff told shareholders in their Q1 commentary, ""Our overweight position in technology narrowed during the quarter as we pared back our semiconductor positions. Our technology overweight is driven by exposure in software and video games."" In addition to their overweight in tech, they are finding attractive investment opportunities in financials.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRed Hat is a software provider. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) are video game holdings. Financial advisor and brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is a financial services holding.Palo Alto is in the network security business. The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's security software industry group. In turn, that group ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups. So the stock is top dog in a top-performing group. It got that way in part by earning IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. The stock also has a three-year earnings per share growth rate of 78%.Red Hat is the leading provider of open source software based on the Linux operating system. The company has been ramping up revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for cloud computing.Earnings per share grew 20% and 49% in the past two quarters.

Still, the stock pulled back about 6% on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.Website host and security tools provider GoDaddy had EPS growth of 150% and 100% for the past two quarters after a 120% EPS pullback in the prior stanza.

2,CPRT,"Share-price gains by a combination of stocks with promise and stocks with solid earnings records have helped put $2.2 billion AB Discovery Growth Fund (CHCLX) among the top mutual funds.Big share-price gainers include Beigene (BGNE) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO) — both yet to post annual profits. More seasoned holdings with solid earnings include Arista Networks (ANET), Align Technology (ALGN), Grubhub (GRUB) and Copart (CPRT).Discovery Growth has joined the ranks of top mutual funds by outperforming 93% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500 in 2017. The fund has also topped 94% of its direct rivals as well as the big-cap bogey this year going into Wednesday and 90% of them along with the benchmark over the past three years.Bruce Aronow, the management team's chief investment officer, says the secret sauce for AB Discovery Growth Fund's recent outperformance has two ingredients. One is ""getting fundamentals right,"" he said. ""That means identifying faster growing companies. The other is identifying companies that can outgrow consensus expectations, that can enjoy positive earnings revisions and surprises.""This top mutual fund uses fundamental research and quantitative modeling to find the companies it wants. ""That quant model triggers off such factors as earnings revisions, momentum, earnings surprises."" The fund wants companies whose growth potential is underappreciated and that post earnings surprises that lure more investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArista makes cloud networking software and hardware. One thing that Aronow likes about Arista is that it does not have to try to make old technology solve new customer challenges. ""Our thesis is that Arista has better solutions to go after the data center market,"" Aronow said. ""It was designed from the ground up to target that, whereas legacy companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have to live with legacy code and technology, which makes it tougher for them to be as nimble as Arista.""Not having to adapt old technology has many benefits, Aronow says. ""Arista's solutions are more scalable,"" he added. ""It offers orders of magnitude better economies. It's been built to focus on what the market needs. That takes some bells and whistles out of the equation. But they provide solutions that the market values.""Arista's three-year earnings per share growth rate is 49%. Annual EPS has grown for five years in a row.IBD'S TAKE: Want to see why Arista is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Computer-Networking industry group? Check out IBD's easy-to-read Stock Checkup page to see how Arista's traits compare to its rivals'. Align Technology is another disruptive holding. In its case, the market it has upset is the one producing orthodontic braces. ""They make Invisalign, which is different from the traditional wire and bracket (orthodontic) solution. Invisalign holds big appeal for adults, who don't want to march around with metal braces as badges of honor. So there's a growing demand from adults.""Align has strengthened its growth by learning to provide aligners for increasingly complex cases, Aronow says. It is also expanding its market by developing products for older teenagers, not just adults.About 20% of North Americans needing orthodontic devices use clear aligners, Aronow says. Invisalign has about an 85% share of that market, he adds.Aronow thinks that clear aligners' market share can at least double. And with just a roughly 10% penetration internationally, ""there's an even better runway there,"" he said.EPS went from negative 2% five quarters ago to gains of 18%, 37%, 60% and 100% in the four most recent stanzas.Takeout food ordering platform Grubhub is an example of a company that benefits from being a first mover. ""This is a classic network effect model,"" Aronow said. He added, ""The model that has the most restaurants and diners continues to grow as a competitive leader because restaurants want broad reach (to the greatest number of prospective customers) and diners want variety.""Grubhub's acquisitions and alliances reinforce its network effect. Among those announced or completed in 2017 were its purchase of Eat24 from Yelp, OrderUp and food-ordering firm Foodler and its Dash delivery service. Grubhub also entered a partnership with Groupon to bring food delivery to Groupon customers across the U.S.Grubhub also agreed to integrate online ordering from all of its restaurants onto Yelp's platform and to make Grubhub the exclusive food-delivery provider for Yelp visitors in exchange for a referral transaction fee.And in February of this year, Yum! Brands said it would buy a 3% stake in Grubhub. Grubhub also said it would provide KFC and Taco Bell with online ordering, pickup and delivery services at their U.S. restaurants.Copart auctions off vehicles that have been declared total losses by insurers. Their inventory is up because more drivers are distracted by smartphones and because repair costs have soared. ""As vehicles have more sophisticated content in the form of sensors and electronics, the cost to repair more vehicles gets increasingly hard to justify,"" Aronow said.Copart share prices have not been hurt badly in the broad market's recent sell-off. Its shares are up about 68% in the past 12 months.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery GrowthYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

24,CPRT,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

31,CPRT,"Fidelity Investments' plan is that shareholders of Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) will find their usual satisfaction in the first five or so months of the year. In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

42,CPRT,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Profit-taking hit some high-profile financial names in the Dow such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), but Wednesday's new-high screen delivered a bunch of new highs in the financial sector from under-the-radar small-cap names.

The S&P 500 also climbed 0.3%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 thrust 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Payment processors were doing well despite mediocre stock ratings. Visa (V) touched a new high in above average volume and then retreated. The stock clung to a 0.1% gain after being up almost 1%.American Express (AXP) popped 1% to 66 in below-average volume.

61,CPRT,"The stock market remained higher in afternoon trading Tuesday as Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other major U.S. banks bounced and some income stocks continued to find favor.The Nasdaq surged 1.8% and the S&P 500 rose 1.3% as it tried to jump back above its 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.1%.Volume was tracking below Monday's levels -- an indication that institutional investors weren't buying with as much enthusiasm as they sold on Monday and Friday. Winners led losers by nearly 6 to 1 on the NYSE and by nearly 5 to 1 on the Nasdaq.Energy, biotech and banking stocks were among the leaders. Citigroup climbed 3% while Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan added 2%, all in heavy trading. But the gains were minor compared to the losses of the previous two days.A number of top-rated stocks found support at the 50-day moving average. While it would be risky to purchase stocks in these new buy areas until the market shows more strength, the support was at least a tentatively good sign.IBD 50 members MarketAxess (MKTX), Copart (CPRT) and Primerica (PRI) were bouncing from the 50-day lines in active trading. Several other IBD 50 stocks also were finding support, but volume was tracking below normal levels.Some real estate investment trusts have climbed past buy points, and those included IBD 50 component Sun Communities (SUI). The stock followed through on a breakout past a 73.47 buy point, adding nearly 3% in above-average volume.Retail Opportunities (ROIC) broke out of a flat base, climbing above the 21.20 buy point in active trading.

Retail Opportunities pays a dividend that works out to an annualized yield of 3.5%.Kimco Realty (KIM) raced past the 30.07 buy point of a lopsided flat base, but volume was unimpressive. The REIT, which owns 550 shopping centers, has a solid 94 Composite Rating from IBD, and its industry group has climbed into the top 30 of 197 groups.

63,CPRT,"Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred within the sector?The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are Medivation (MDVN) and Emergent BioSolutions (EBS).Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) .Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- Alibaba (BABA) and Starbucks (SBUX).Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are Five Below (FIVE), Copart (CPRT) and Dollar General (DG).Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.

65,CPRT,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.

85,CPRT,"When it comes to accelerating profit, O'Reilly Automotive operates in high gear. O'Reilly (ORLY), highly rated by IBD, has logged 16 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth.
"
86,CPRT,"Analysts see it staying in the fast lane as the specialty retailer of aftermarket auto parts continues to rev up its business by luring commercial and do-it-yourself customers with top-flight service, a deep and broad-based inventory and far-flung distribution capabilities.
"
87,CPRT,"Lower gas prices should prompt people to drive more and put more stress on their cars, fueling demand for parts and services from O'Reilly and its large auto parts retail peers, including AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), analysts say.
"
88,CPRT,"Last year, O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers got a nice jolt from the extremely cold winter, which increased wear and tear on cars, driving up demand for auto parts.
"
89,CPRT,"DIY Does Well
"
90,CPRT,"O'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.
"
91,CPRT,"At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.
"
92,CPRT,"O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.
"
93,CPRT,"Why the investor enthusiasm?
"
94,CPRT,"""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""
"
95,CPRT,"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.
"
96,CPRT,"""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""
"
97,CPRT,"O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.
"
98,CPRT,"Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.

"
103,CPRT,"""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.
"
104,CPRT,"""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.
"
105,CPRT,"What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.
"
106,CPRT,"He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.
"
107,CPRT,"""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""
"
108,CPRT,"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.
"
109,CPRT,"""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.
"
110,CPRT,"Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.

113,CPRT,"Low Gas Prices Drive Business
"
114,CPRT,"Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.
"
115,CPRT,"""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.
"
116,CPRT,"They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.
"
117,CPRT,"Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.
"
118,CPRT,"""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said. ""At some point the deferment catches up.
"
119,CPRT,"""Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.""

120,CPRT,"O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail-Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which also includes Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Copart (CPRT), Pep Boys (PBY) and a handful of others. O'Reilly gets the highest IBD Composite Rating of those companies, a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.When it comes to accelerating profit, O'Reilly Automotive operates in high gear. O'Reilly (ORLY), highly rated by IBD, has logged 16 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth.Analysts see it staying in the fast lane as the specialty retailer of aftermarket auto parts continues to rev up its business by luring commercial and do-it-yourself customers with top-flight service, a deep and broad-based inventory and far-flung distribution capabilities.Lower gas prices should prompt people to drive more and put more stress on their cars, fueling demand for parts and services from O'Reilly and its large auto parts retail peers, including AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), analysts say.Last year, O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers got a nice jolt from the extremely cold winter, which increased wear and tear on cars, driving up demand for auto parts.DIY Does WellO'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.Why the investor enthusiasm?""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a ""wonderful"" company.""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share.

379,CPRT,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) debuted on 04/20/2016, and offers broad exposure to the Consumer Discretionary ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $319.21 M, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Consumer Discretionary ETFs. IBUY is managed by Amplify Etfs. IBUY, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the EQM Online Retail Index.The EQM Online Retail Index utilizes a rules based methodology to select a globally diverse group of companies with 70% or more of revenue from online and virtual sales.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for IBUY are 0.65%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Tripadvisor Inc accounts for about 4.24% of the fund's total assets, followed by Iac Interactivecorp (IAC  -  Free Report) and Copart Inc (CPRT  -  Free Report).IBUY's top 10 holdings account for about 36.11% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has gained about 15.68%, and is up about 42.06% in the last one year (as of 06/01/2018). IBUY has traded between $33.55 and $47.70 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.70 and standard deviation of 16.30% for the trailing three-year period. With about 40 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

382,CPRT,"Smart investors always opt for a plan that is likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance. Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rankstocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 18.Here are four stocks from the 18 that made it through the screen:Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) provides sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis.

384,CPRT,"The United States and its allies have launched target missiles on Syria, dragging the benchmarks down in the final hours of trading on Apr 13. Such escalating tensions, however, shouldn’t dampen investors’ spirits for long.After all, mounting military tensions, historically, has had no effect on markets but on humans. In fact, markets in crisis have usually recovered quickly. Keeping this in mind, investing in solid growth stocks doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Syria Air StrikesWestern powers had carried out missile attacks at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons facilities. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 cruise missiles on three chemical weapon facilities, including a development center in Damascus’ Barzeh region and two installations near Homs. The strike was carried out after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sanctioned a chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus.This retaliation was the biggest by any Western force against Assad and his superpower ally Russia. However, the Western countries did mention that the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapon facilities and not aimed at Assad. Nevertheless, such targeted military strikes against the Syrian government have dented investors’ sentiment of late.Investors Shouldn’t PanicInvestors should not fear a missile strike on Syria as such attacks have limited impact on the stock market, especially over the long run. Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co, said that immediately after a military strike, markets tend to lose around 0.3%, but there is nothing earth-shattering about it. Such movements happen during every normal trading session almost.In fact, post-crisis lows open up good buying opportunities, per an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. After major geopolitical crisis in the past century, they have found that the market rebound has been so solid that within six months it stands higher than where it was before the catastrophe.Ned Davis Research analyzed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average on average fell 3.2% after any crisis, yet by six months, the blue-chip index manages to recover from the lows. In fact, it scales higher in 12 months’ time. If the Sep 11, 2011 attack is to be considered, the index tanked 17.5% five trading sessions later. But, it bounced back in less than two months and was higher than where it had been on Sep 10.Trump has tweeted that attacks on Syria were “mission accomplished.” This also suggests that the President won’t be carrying out attacks that may raise risks of a broader conflict, involving Russia.Time for Traders to Cheer UpThe American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), in the meantime, showed that bearish sentiments in the market jumped 6.1 percentage points to 42.8%. The Syrian crisis and China’s trade surplus with the U.S. improving, thereby, adding fuel to the ongoing trade conflict added to the bearish sentiments.However, the AAII survey is always used as a contrarian indicator, boosting traders’ confidence when the readings get scary. And why not? As investor sentiments are now decidedly bearish, the market has neared a bottom, which means it has only one way to go, that’s upward.5 Top WinnersWith the markets expected to scale north after a crisis, investing in sound growth stocks seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Style Score of A or B.

385,CPRT,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report), a firm in the Auction and Valuation Services industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, CPRT has beaten estimates by at least 20% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, CPRT was expected to post earnings of 26 cents per share, while it actually produced 33 cents per share, a beat of 26.9%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 38 cents per share, when it actually saw 47 cents per share instead, representing a 23.7% positive surprise.Copart, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Copart, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Copart, Inc. QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Copart. In fact, the Earnings ESP for CPRT is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for CPRT, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.81%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that CPRT has a great Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that CPRT could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

388,CPRT,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February. A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U.S. sales. A robust economy, product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans’ new-found liking for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago.Also, during the week, just prior to the March sales release, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reportedly said that it will do away with the age-old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short-term volatility, therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated. It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry.Also, the electric vehicles (EVs) maker, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) published its production figures for first-quarter 2018, which totaled 34,494 vehicles, up 40% sequentially. This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla. Out of the total vehicles produced, 24,728 were Model S and Model X, and 9,766 were Model 3. The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis. However, the company missed its target of producing 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of first-quarter 2018. Actually, it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days. Despite the production target miss, the first-quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 29, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Fox Business, Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123,000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components.The Palo Alto, CA-based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions. The company explained that it has detected “excessive corrosion” in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles. This glitch might result in reduced power steering.The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component. The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions.However, the recent recall has further added to Tesla’s woes, which is already grappling with several challenges, particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan, the low-cost EV targeting the mass market. (Read more: Vehicles Recall Continues Unabated: Tesla, No Exception)Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).2.    In a pioneering move, General Motors has reportedly taken the decision to abandon its usual practice of reporting sales on a monthly basis in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company’s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry, as it includes short-term fluctuations. However, per management, quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same.Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors. It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30-day period. This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures. According to the automaker, incentive campaigns, abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down.However, the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile, longer-term metric to evaluate its performance. Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect. This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil, General Motors’ U.S. vice president for sales operations, “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market.” McNeil further said, “Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business, and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing.” (Read more: General Motors to Drop Monthly Sales Report, Enticing Others)General Motors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

391,CPRT,"Favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance.  Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.However, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) — to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    Zacks Rank better than or equal to #2(Only Zacks Rank #1 and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 20.

401,CPRT,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health. Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 21.Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen:Copart, Inc.

402,CPRT,"The economic backdrop exhibits signs of improvement with the rise in GDP, a better employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum gained by oil prices.  The outlook for business services sector moves in line with the broader economy. Significantly, the business-friendly orientation of the current administration is widely expected to give the U.S. economy a nudge of growth.  The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market. Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies, helping them benefit from operating efficiencies. Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies -- for example, payroll processing, staffing, marketing/advertising and information technology, to name some of the major areas. Gradual improvement in interest rate environment points toward improving economic conditions. The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.The Fed also provided an optimistic employment outlook. Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to be 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019 and 4% in 2020.President Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35%. This move is likely to act as an impetus. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters. GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2.4% in 2018 and 2019, better than 2.3% in 2017. This favorable outlook for the U.S. economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well. No doubt the Zacks Business Services sector has been a strong performer, gaining 20.9% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 18.2% gain. The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability. Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, as well as improving competitive positioning. Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks. Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. Per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the sector’s total revenue. Stand-Alone Zacks Sector: Favorable Given the group’s unique nature, Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P’s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the ‘Industrials’ sector). Notably, with about 3.8% of total market capitalization, the sector generated 3.1% of the total S&P 500 income in 2017. This industry offers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry. Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium (M-level) and 265 industries at the expanded (X-level). We rank all 265 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page. We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.) Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks – the core of our Industry Rank – has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have eight X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services. Staffing at #59, Business Information Services at #65, Auction/Valuation Services at #68, Waste Removal at #88 and Outsourcing at #108 all fall in the top half.Financial Transaction Services at #148, Business Services at #171 and Consulting at #234 are the industries that fall in the bottom half.Our top picks from the Outsourcing industries are ExlService Holdings, Inc. (EXLS  -  Free Report) and The Brink's Co. (BCO  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (HSII  -  Free Report), On Assignment, Inc. (ASGN  -  Free Report)  and Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are our top picks from the Staffing industry. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Black Knight, Inc. (BKI  -  Free Report), IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO  -  Free Report) and S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, are our favorites from the Business Information Services. A Zacks #1 Ranked player, Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) is our top pick from Auction/Valuation Services. US Ecology, Inc. (ECOL  -  Free Report) and Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) are #2 Ranked player and our favorite from the Waste Removal industry.Valuation of the SectorThe valuation of the business service sector seems attractive relative to its own history as well as the broader S&P 500 index.The Zacks Business Service sector is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.2X. Over the last five years, the sector has traded as low as 9.2X and as high as 11.2X with a median of 10X. In other words, the sector is currently trading at the high end of its five-year range and higher than median on a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. On a forward 12-month EPS basis, the sector trades at 21.8X, comparing with the five-year range of 19.1X and 21.8X and a median of 20.3X. In other words, the sector is trading toward the high end of its five-year forward 12-month P/E range as well as its median. The sector is trading at a discount to the S&P 500 index on the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. The sector modestly underperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. While the sector has gained 21.3%, the index has rallied 23.2%.  Earnings Outlook Companies have already started reporting fourth-quarter earnings. While earnings are expected to be improving 5.4%, revenues will grow 4.8%. Both compare unfavorably with the S&P 500 index. For 2017, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 9.4% on 3.7% revenue growth compared with the S&P 500 index’s earnings growth of 7.5% on back of 5.2% top-line growth.   For 2018, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 12% on 6.4% revenue growth. This compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s expected earnings increase of 13.7% but favorably with 5.1% higher revenues from 2017.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500. The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500 index. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

408,CPRT,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (RBA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in RBA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 94 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 87 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 19 cents a share from 24 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 12.6% in the past month.Ritchie Bros.

409,CPRT,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Copart (CPRT  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Copart is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CPRT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 27 cents per share for CPRT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CPRT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.14% heading into earnings season.Copart, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Copart, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Copart, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

413,CPRT,"Last week saw usual readiness on the part of several automakers to move toward electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) announced that it has collaborated with Mahindra Group, an Indian automotive manufacturing company, to work on areas such as mobility programs, electrifications, connected vehicle projects and product development, among other aspects.Even Autoliv, Inc.’s (ALV  -  Free Report) plans of splitting into two separate publicly traded companies — Passive Safety and Electronics — gives an indication that auto companies are seriously mulling over producing electric vehicles (EVs).Amid this, a couple of companies came up with their earnings results. Both AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) and Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results.In this otherwise normal week, a few automakers were once again embroiled in recall issues. The cases of recalls in China, the largest car market in the world, can prove to be serious for these automakers. At a time when these automakers are investing huge money on electric vehicles, these recalls are further putting strains on their exchequers.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Sep 14, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Autoliv recently announced that it is mulling over splitting into two separate publicly traded companies. The decision to split is currently under strategic review. The plans of separating its two business segments — Passive Safety and Electronics — sent its share price soaring.However, there is no certainty that the review would fructify into a separation or listing of the businesses. If the separation at all happens, it would take around a year.While one entity would focus on passive safety, which includes equipment such as airbags and seatbelts, the other would concentrate on automotive radars and cameras with driver-assist systems, which are used in autonomous-driving technology (read more: Autoliv Stock Soars on Electronics Segment Split-Off Plan).Currently, Autoliv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2.    AutoZone reported 6.1% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share to $15.18 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Aug 26, 2017). Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.11. Net income increased 1.7% to $433.9 million.For fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings per share increased year over year from $40.70 to $43.04.Quarterly revenues improved 3.3% year over year to $3.51 billion. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion.Domestic same-store sales (sales for stores open at least for one year) increased 1% year over year.Fiscal 2017 sales rose to $10.89 from $10.64 billion a year ago.Gross profit increased to $1.85 billion from $1.79 billion in the prior-year quarter. Operating profit rose to $707.6 million from $703.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 32.6% from 32.1% a year ago (read more: AutoZone Q4 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Up Y/Y).3.    Ford has agreed to collaborate with Mahindra Group, an Indian automotive manufacturing company. This strategic alliance aims at using the skill and global reach of the former with the latter’s presence in India.In an age of unparalleled changes in the global auto industry, strengths will be exploited mutually to drive profitable growth in India and other emerging markets.For a period of three years, teams from both companies will synergize on areas that include mobility programs, electrifications, connected vehicle projects, product development and many more aspects.Ford believes that this coalition will enable it to deliver the best batch of vehicles and services to customers as well as grow profitably in the world’s fifth largest vehicle market. Further, in conjunction with India’s ambition to convert into electric vehicles, this cooperation will help both parties to tap the growing potential of the utility market and the emerging usage of battery-powered electric vehicles (read more: Ford Partners Mahindra to Power Electric Vehicles in India).4.    The problem of recalls is far from over for global automakers. The last few days saw auto giants General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford and Volkswagen AG facing recalls again.Reportedly, General Motors will be recalling more than 2.5 million vehicles in China. The issue stemmed from concerns over faulty airbags manufactured by Takata. This is indeed a serious blow to the U.S. automaker, which will start withdrawing faulty vehicles from next month. Ford has reportedly come closer to recalling SUV models in the United States. Reports of leakage in exhaust fumes were responsible for this development.Last week, German automaker Volkswagen announced that along with Chinese joint-venture partners, it will recall 4.86 million vehicles in China. Once again, the reason was faulty air bags supplied by Takata.The instances of recalls in China, the largest car market in the world, can be damaging for these automakers. At a time when these automakers are investing open-handedly on electric vehicles, these recalls are doing no good to them (read more: Recalls Plague Automakers: General Motors, Ford in Focus).5.    Copart reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. The figure shows a steep rise of 20.7% from 29 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Net income was $70.3 million, reflecting a decrease of 16.4% or $13.8 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Copart’s revenues rose 13.8% to $378.6 million from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $355.5 million.
