1,DGX,"Several major health care companies are exploring the use of blockchain technology to improve the way health care provider data are shared and managed.The partnership follows a separate effort announced in January by Amazon (AMZN), Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) ""to address health care for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.""This time, Humana (HUM), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Multiplan, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) Optum and UnitedHeathcare units are embarking on a pilot program to use blockchain to ""improve data quality and reduce administrative costs associated with changes to health care provider demographic data,"" per a press release Monday.The cost of various health care organizations each managing their own health care provider data — and having to resolve issues with each other when differences crop up — amounts to $2.1 billion annually, said the companies.It's ""such a large issue that it's really affecting access to care for many patients,"" Optum engineer Mike Jacobs told CNBC.The joint effort, which will study how blockchain can help them to tackle these issues and improve access to health care, is the latest in non-cryptocurrency companies exploring use of the ledger. While blockchain was thrust into the spotlight by its association with Bitcoin, there are a multitude of other applications for blockchain.Microsoft (MSFT) and JPMorgan have teamed up to develop blockchain-driven financial services tools, for example.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

2,DGX,"Just as it stepped on the accelerator in the race to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, Zenuity hit a traffic jam of sorts.XThe data-storage technology used by the joint venture to make autonomous vehicles couldn't pump out visual data fast enough to let its new Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processors work at anything approaching top speed.Enter Pure Storage (PSTG) and its FlashBlade technology. As one of 10 vendors brought in to clear the bottleneck, Pure Storage left the competition in the dust and a partnership was born, according to the website Next Platform.""The partnership with Nvidia started in the field, which I think is generally, at least in my experience, where the best partnerships begin,"" Pure Storage President David Hatfield said on a recent company earnings call.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePure Storage is still a relatively small player in a slow-growing industry. Yet it's competing in fast-growing areas and taking market share from legacy providers.Its relationship with Nvidia serves as a prime example. Joint marketing activities between Pure Storage and Nvidia have been ongoing for several quarters. The wins have been piling up, helping push Pure Storage to profitability in the latest quarter. Following its first product launch in 2012 and initial public offering in 2015, Pure Storage eclipsed $1 billion in annual revenue for fiscal 2018.On March 27, Pure Storage announced its AI-Ready Infrastructure, which combines its FlashBlade and Nvidia's DGX-1 high-performance workstation as a fully integrated hardware and software system. The aim is to enable scientists to jump-start their artificial intelligence initiatives ""in hours, not weeks or months.""Pure Storage and Nvidia share other traits. Both stocks broke out of consolidations into buy zones on May 7. Nvidia cleared a double-bottom base ahead of its earnings report. Pure Storage broke above a cup-with-handle pattern.Pure Storage shares climbed more than 2% Wednesday morning and were near 23.50. Nvidia was up 1% near 248.10.IBD'S TAKE: Pure Storage cleared a 21.43 buy point on Monday, May 7. A buy point is the point at which a stock has the greatest likelihood of further near-term gains, especially when the stock is a leader in a leading industry group. Pure Storage qualifies as the No. 3 stock, according to IBD Stock Checkup, in the Computer-Data Storage industry group that's ranked No. 7 of 197 groups based on price performance and momentum. Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a recent note to clients, initiating coverage on Pure Storage, that FlashBlade accounted for roughly $80 million, or 10%, of product sales in the past year.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski expects FlashBlade to emerge as Pure Storage's top revenue producer ""over the next 2-3 years, as more Big Data and Artificial Intelligence workloads are deployed.""In a recent note to clients, Nowinski said the unstructured data that dominates artificial intelligence historically is stored on disk-based, networked devices from the likes of NetApp (NTAP) and Dell Technologies (DVMT). He says they ""cannot meet the performance requirements of next-generation analytics.""Nowinski sees Pure Storage's system that relies on flash memory rather than spinning hard-disk drives, as ""uniquely positioned to capture market share in this segment.""FlashBlade's debut in the second half of 2016 opened a new market for Pure Storage. It also gave the company a full portfolio to serve the data-storage needs of enterprise customers.Supporting all of a customer's workloads has helped Pure Storage move upmarket. It sells to cloud-service providers and has gained more Fortune 500 customers looking to consolidate storage vendors used in their data centers, Nowinski says.About 50% of FlashBlade customers were already Pure Storage customers, he notes. The company said it signed up about 500 new customers in the latest quarter. That raised the total to more than 4,500 organizations.The company puts its total addressable market opportunity at $35 billion. Meanwhile, the market for external storage systems stands at $23 billion a year and dropped slightly in 2017, William Blair analyst Jason Ader said. He expects it to be flat over the next several years. Yet the areas that Pure Storage plays in grew 35% last year, he says.Tech research firm IDC expects all-flash arrays to comprise 44% of external storage sales by 2021. That's up from the current figure of 28%. Scribner thinks that projection could prove conservative.""Current infrastructures are based on old, slow, scale-out architectures which demand many data copies and silos, fragmenting the potential of data and increasing its cost and complexity,"" Pure Storage Chief Executive Charles Giancarlo said on a recent earnings call.Giancarlo came aboard as CEO last August, having previously served as chief technology officer at Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is a key partner for Pure Storage and seen as a potential acquirer. Pure Storage markets its FlashArray and FlashBlade storage system with Cisco networking gear in an optimized package called FlashStack.Ader adds that roughly 30% of Pure's revenue in the latest quarter came from public cloud customers, such as software-as-a-service providers Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Management has noted that this vertical has been growing faster than the overall business and that it now has over 500 cloud customers to date,"" he wrote.But getting business from the big public cloud providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is considered out of reach.Still, Pure Storage said last August that FlashStack was seeing triple-digit growth. It reported thousands of deployments in more than 30 countries.The company is widely credited as being the technology leader in its field. Industry research firm Gartner placed Pure Storage as being furthest along on its ""completeness of vision"" axis for solid state arrays.Ader says Pure Storage designed its software and systems architecture from the ground up to take advantage of flash media. In contrast, rivals for the most part designed their products for hard disk ""and only later retrofitted for flash.""The market appears to be recognizing that leadership as evidenced in customer win rates. Those are ""ticking up quarter-by-quarter,"" Giancarlo says. Further, Ader notes, Pure Storage was able to carve out 66.4% product gross margins in calendar 2017 vs. 50.2% for NetApp.With so much going for it, what could slow Pure Storage's momentum?""The biggest risk is the competition,"" Ader told Investor's Business Daily.Dell EMC has acknowledged its market-share struggles in storage and pledged to spend $2 billion to turn it around. Dell last week unveiled new storage products aimed at negating Pure Storage's technology lead.But Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wasn't impressed. He compared Dell's updated product line with that of what he considers the more up-to-date Pure Storage.His assessment: It ""did very little to narrow the gap.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Pure Storage, 58.com Are Breakouts; These 3 Top Stocks Are In Same Bullish PatternCloud Software Stock Splunk Breaks Out Of Base Ahead Of Quarterly ResultsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch console demand and virtual-reality headsets also are likely to drive Nvidia chip sales, Steves said.In his bull-case scenario, Steves believes Nvidia could hit 300 if it continues to see high growth in gaming and data center chip sales and gets a material boost from automotive chip sets for self-driving cars.RELATED:Nvidia Impresses Analysts At Supercomputing Conference

He estimates 8%-10% cuts for Quest and LabCorp, above his initial views for 4%-6%.Under the proposal, Genomic Health, Veracyte, CareDx, Biodesix and Vermillion will grab increases of 12%-35% for some of their tests. But, on the other side, 58% of tests will undergo phased-in reductions from 2018-20.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Quest dove 7.4% to 94.57, as LabCorp shares toppled 3.1% to finish at 150.32.RELATED:Quest Gets Price-Target Hike On Safeway Tie; Ancestry.com OpportunityQuest 'Turnaround' Follows Management Shake-Up, Flat 2015 Sales

Consumer goods funds also did well, growing 2.00%.""The technology sector did well because of across-the-board interest in cell phones, mobile devices and software,"" said Bernie Horn, a manager of $431.8 million Polaris Global Value Fund (PGVFX), an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, having outperformed the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years that ended Dec. 31.Some cloud computing leaders also added to tech's showing. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) posted gains. ""They are growing their cloud services dramatically,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has a solid 97 Composite Rating. It posted a 32.1% earnings surprise last quarter. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Defensive sectors also did well as investors sought safety amid doubts about the strength of economic growth. ""The market was having a debate,"" Chalupnik said. ""Investors aren't sure which way the economy is headed. The economic numbers that (came out) in May were mixed. The employment number was OK, but retail sales were a little light. The CPI (inflation rate) number was low for the second month in a row."" That last item is a sign that the U.S. economy is not heating up very fast.Precious metals funds, a defensive group, inched up 0.34% due to investor jitters over Washington, D.C., Horn said. ""The weekly hysteria over Trump comments regarding Russia tends to make some people think that the Federal Reserve may not be able to increase rates as expected,"" he said. ""That puts monetary policy into flux, which usually drives money into precious metals.""Large-cap growth funds gained 2.87%, leading U.S. diversified stock mutual fund categories.World equity funds easily topped U.S. stock funds with a 2.92% gain.Taxable bond funds inched up 0.64% on average. Tax-exempt funds tacked on 1.20%.Going forward, Horn expects stock markets to benefit from improving economic growth and diminished political drama. ""Notwithstanding political volatility around the world, underlying economic growth is slowly increasing,"" Horn said. ""And there's less of the uncertainty that was holding back individual and corporate spending. The U.S. elections, Brexit (the initial decision), the French election — all are in the past. The U.S. market has seen valuations rise. But outside the U.S., there are lots of great values.""Magna International (MGA), a Canada-based maker of car and truck parts, is one such name he likes. ""In an environment where competition among parts suppliers has been reduced, surviving companies like this are well-positioned to provide components whether the world goes electric or not,"" he said.And he still sees U.S. stocks that he likes. ""Quest Diagnostic (DGX) is the largest provider of medical tests in the country,"" Horn said. ""They're doing a better job of creating efficiencies in their operations, keeping costs in line.""He also likes NextEra Energy (NEE). ""It's one of the best-run utilities in the country if not the world, with a strong presence in clean fuels like natural gas and wind and solar to a lesser extent. It's not the cheapest stock, but management makes continuous improvements in their cost structure.""Horn also expects health insurers and managed care providers Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to benefit from the reduction of regulatory burdens of any arrangement that replaces or reforms ObamaCare.Chalupnik sees potential for better growth from key foreign markets than the U.S. Europe, China, Japan and emerging markets are growing at decent rates, he says. ""The whole global economy is growing together,"" he said. ""It's the first time since 2010 that you could say that.""His team has overweights in materials and industrials relative to the S&P 500, although it has trimmed its overweights. It has held its energy weighting steady.Detroit Edison (DTE) illustrates his appetite for energy. ""People and businesses still need electricity,"" he said. ""It is a very well run utility. It has good management, a good regulatory environment. It delivers quarter-in, quarter-out."" In addition, the stock has a 3% dividend yield.He also likes Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). ""It's a very stable company, probably the next big growth company out there. It's one of the few retailers that's growing same-store sales. And its e-commerce business is tremendous. And it's trading at an attractive multiple.""Share price is up 15% so far this year, including a 5% gain in May. But the stock has a weak 59 Composite Rating from IBD, on a scale from 1 to 99.Douglas Burtnick, a manager of $1.8 billion Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXIX), an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for topping the S&P 500 over one, three, five and 10 years, likes Ellie Mae (ELLI). ""They sell software and services to banks, which help them create more efficiency around the mortgage origination process,"" he said.Ellie Mae's systems are helping to transform what has been a paper-oriented industry into a digitally focused one. ""That makes the process faster and easier,"" Burtnick said. ""Banks are willing to pay for that efficiency.""And Chalupnick likes the outlook for Lamb Weston (LW), a producer and distributor of frozen foods that was spun out of ConAgra (CAG) late last year. ""It is a relatively new company, and it is under-followed,"" he said. ""They are one of the few packaged-goods food companies that is growing its unit volume. General Mills unit volume is down (in its North American retail segment).""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Look For Winners In Industrials, Materials, Tech, BanksThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

11,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) partnerships with Optum and Safeway (SWY), as well as opportunities it is pursuing with IBM (IBM) Watson and Ancestry.com, garnered the stock a price-target boost Tuesday.In the stock market today, Quest stock rose 0.6% to 92.45, after earlier rising as much as 1.6%. Shares have traded above their 50-day moving average for seven weeks. Quest stock closed 2016 up 29%.UBS analyst A.J. Rice kept his buy rating on Quest stock and upped his price target to 102 from 90.Rice expects Quest's partnership with Optum will help the firm curb its bad-debt expense and its uncompensated care. Optum agreed to manage Quest's revenue services, including billing, in a pact announced in September.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech-companies like Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences are seeing rivalries heat up as companies lay down their cards for 2017.Quest inked major deals with HCA in Denver and with RWJ Barnabas Health in New Jersey in late 2015 and 2016, respectively. Quest has also made inroads with its partnership with grocery chain Safeway, and now aims to put more than 200 patient service centers (PSCs) in Safeway stores by the end of 2017.Beyond those specific opportunities, Quest is looking to work with IBM's Watson supercomputer unit on a project related to tumor sequencing, and with Ancestry.com to improve health care decision-making based on family medical histories, Rice wrote in a research report.Rice estimates 3% sales growth in 2017, just below the midpoint of Quest's guidance for 3%-5% growth this year. RELATED:Quest 'Turnaround' Follows Management Shake-up, Flat 2015 SalesMyriad Genetics Stock Craters As Competition Surprises Wall Street

13,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) ""turnaround"" is well underway following a management shake-up in 2014 and flat 2015 sales, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said Monday as he reiterated his buy rating on the stock.Massaro's assessment followed Quest's investor day Friday, when Quest bumped the low end of its 2017-2020 sales view to 3%-5% growth and kept its high-single-digit earnings growth view. Key markets include advanced diagnostics and professional lab services.These growth markets will help offset low-single-digit growth in its core diagnostics business, Massaro wrote in a research note. Professional lab services target the inpatient portion of hospital labs and marks an ""organic business win, not an acquisition,"" he noted.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs and drugmakers are poised for a rally following the election of Donald Trump, analysts say. Could Quest come along for the ride? Get the scoop at IBD's Industry Themes.Quest has survived thus far by ""blocking and tackling,"" he wrote. It consolidated 20 regional call centers into two, consolidated various labs, increased credit-card capture to 63%, and reduced its sales force turnover to 9% from 30%.Now, Quest is positioned for growth from increasing lab-services agreements with hospitals and acquiring outreach businesses targeting hospitals, which, respectively, represent $12 billion and $17 billion addressable markets.Massaro added that he would be surprised if Quest made any larger acquisition of a specialized lab business anytime soon.The company is expanding its retail footprint to 200 stores within Safeway (SWY) grocery stores in 2017, up from 50.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Quest stock jumped 4.5% to 85.10.

14,DGX,"Shares of Myriad Genetics (MYGN) fell off a cliff to a four-year low Wednesday as the gene-testing firm was downgraded by several analysts after its guidance fell short late Tuesday.Myriad's fiscal Q4 earnings and guidance were a hair short of analysts' consensus, but its 2017 guidance was off by a large margin. Its revenue range of $740 million to $760 million was at least $30 million below Wall Street's number and on the low end would represent a drop from last year. Its EPS guidance range of $1 to $1.10 was some 40% below consensus.The impact of the 2013 Supreme Court decision invalidating some of the patents on Myriad's breast-cancer gene test is still working its way through the market, writes Mizuho analyst Eric Criscuolo in a research note. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) and Bio-Reference Labs (now part of Opko Health (OPK)) came out with rival tests right away, and new competitors continue to emerge.""Myriad had largely kept competition at bay since the Supreme Court patent decision, but it has apparently has accelerated in the quarter,"" Criscuolo wrote in a note lowering his price target on Myriad stock to 22 from 34. ""There have been new players emerging in the hereditary cancer space, both established companies and private, startup types.""IBD'S TAKE: While such a huge drop couldn't have been predicted, Myriad's stock has been giving off warning signs lately, such as a falling Accumulation/Distribution Rating. This is a letter grade IBD assigns to stocks based on institutional buying and selling.Wells Fargo analyst Tim Evans said Myriad's guidance surprised him.""Our Outperform thesis on Myriad was predicated on modest erosion in price but with more share stability than bears believed in the core hereditary franchise,"" Evans wrote, as he downgraded the stock to market perform. ""The company's fiscal Q4 2016 report and fiscal 2017 guidance makes clear we were wrong about share stability.""Piper Jaffray, Barclays and Gabelli also downgraded the stock to neutral or the equivalent thereof. Mizuho's Criscuolo was already neutral, but he declined to downgrade it further, saying that ""upside drivers could realistically emerge as the year progresses.""By the closing bell, Myriad stock plummeted more than 33% to 19.70 on the stock market today, crashing below 20 for the first time since January 2012.

"
16,DGX,"Techies often quip that the internet is made of cats. And whether you love or hate the proliferation of cat videos traveling around social media, they reflect an important underlying trend: Americans take videos of cats partly because they have more of them.In times of robust consumer spending -- like now -- people are more willing to adopt pets and commit to the long-term care of those animals. That includes their health care, which unlike most human health care, is paid out of pocket by the patient's doting family.This has worked to the benefit of VCA (WOOF), America's leading chain of animal hospitals. The company benefits from the amusing ticker symbol of ""WOOF,"" but the interest in the sector is serious.""Big money is flowing into defensive areas such as food, beverage, tobacco and utility stocks,"" ETF manager Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Tactical Management said in an email. ""Pet-care stocks fit that mold and have caught a strong bid recently as consumers now consider pets as part of their family. Even if the economy slows down, or enters a recession, consumers will continue to spend on their pets.""To be fair, the big recession of 2007-09 was deep enough to hit the veterinary business, including VCA. But over the last 20 years, spending on pets has grown an average of 7% per year, according to Morningstar.And since the third quarter of 2011, VCA's profit and sales growth has been almost continuous, driven by unceasing increases in pet ownership.""According to Pethealth, Inc., a leading provider of management software to animal welfare organizations in North America, year-over-year growth in pet adoptions across 1,226 animal shelters rose 5.5% in December, with average growth of 6.0% over the trailing three-month period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wilson wrote in her Feb. 3 initiation report on VCA. ""Pet euthanasia, inversely correlated to pet demand, dropped 15% in December, consistent with recent monthly trends, which was a positive for overall pet ownership.""These trends continued in the first quarter, according to VCA Chief Executive Robert Antin, noting that growth went beyond just hospitals.""The numbers that I see are contradictory on the new pets, but I don't think there's any question, there's a lot more pets that are out there,"" Antin said on the conference call discussing first-quarter results with analysts on April 27.""We have a great vantage point through Camp Bow Wow,"" Antin went on to say. ""The most disposable (spending) level that you have is doggy day care, and it's rising at around 10% same-store growth.""Camp Bow Wow, with around 120 sites, is one of several non-hospital services that VCA offers that currently provide about 20% of revenue. The most significant is Antech Diagnostics, its chain of 60 reference laboratories -- that is, labs performing specialty tests referred to it by hospitals and clinics. VCA and Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) hold a virtual duopoly in this market, and it is considered a lucrative trade.""We find the hefty lab operating margins -- often north of 40% -- extremely appealing and far better than Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) human diagnostic operating margins of 15%,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang in an April 27 report.The margins also are higher than those of VCA's hospital business -- so even though Antech provides 18% of revenue, it provides 42% of operating profit. Still, the company has continued to enlarge its hospital network because it sees the industry as ripe for consolidation.VCA, North America's largest free-standing chain -- privately held rival Banfield has around 900 locations, but mostly inside PetSmart retail stores -- owns 762 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. But that's out of some 26,000 total hospitals north of the Rio Grande, according to Credit Suisse.Some of these are smaller chains, which VCA sees as acquisition targets. Most recently, on May 3 it acquired an 80% interest in Companion Animal Practices, North America, a Las Vegas-based chain of 56 animal hospitals.But it also likes to buy up single-site practices, provided that they have annual revenue of at least $1.2 million and employ at least two full-time veterinarians. To that end, it has a permanent ""Selling Your Hospital"" section on its website that says it can complete a transaction in 60 to 120 days.VCA also has been willing to buy to fill out its reference lab business. Last year it acquired the reference lab business of Abaxis (ABAX) for $21 million, helping build out its moat against competitors.""It would be difficult for a startup to replicate VCA's reference lab infrastructure,"" analyst Wang wrote in her report. ""Labs compete on the basis of high levels of service, access to veterinary specialists for consultations, accuracy, and timeliness. (VCA) has established a sizable footprint in the most densely populated metropolitan areas where both density of pet ownership and relatively high household income support VCA's efficient lab operations.""All this buyout activity leads Phil Davis, CEO of PSW Investments, to call VCA a ""roll-up play."" However, in recent quarters it has also shown some organic growth. In the first quarter, same-store sales grew 7.6% at outlets on the hospital side that were open for more than a year, while internal growth in the lab business was 9.1%.Overall, VCA's earnings in the quarter rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 66 cents a share, while revenue climbed 13% to $563 million. That beat Wall Street's expectations, which had fallen after it issued a weak fourth-quarter report and guidance in January, and broke the stock out of a nine-month consolidation. On June 9, shares touched an all-time high of 66.26.Shares were down a little more than 1% on Friday but staked out new gains on Monday and hit an all-time high intraday of 66.98. The same happened on Tuesday, as shares hit a new intraday high of 67.78 before settling back to 67.35, a new closing high. With an overall Composite Rating of 97, VCA is No. 22 on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.It can be tough to forecast the growth of an acquisition-loving company, but analysts expect earnings to grow 21% this year to $2.87 a share, representing a slight deceleration from last year's 26% increase. Revenue is forecast to rise 16% to $2.47 billion, the highest growth rate since 2007.Analyst Wilson estimated on May 3 that the single-digit organic growth should continue, though not quite as robustly as in the first quarter. She forecasts 3% to 5% full-year growth on the hospital side and 6% to 8% growth on the lab side.

17,DGX,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose fractionally Monday morning after announcing that it is cutting ties with troubled blood-testing firm Theranos.Walgreens, in a late Sunday statement, said it is ending their three-year partnership and will shut all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers in Walgreens locations. Walgreens halted using Theranos lab testing services at its Palo Alto, Calif., location in January amid growing allegations that Theranos' claims did not hold up.“In light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has rejected Theranos’ plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers’ best interests to terminate our partnership,” said Brad Fluegel, Walgreens Senior Vice President and Chief Health Care Commercial Market Development Officer.Walgreens stock climbed 2.3% to 84.36 by the closing bell on the stock market today.Multiple regulatory and health agencies are investigating Theranos over the accuracy of its blood tests. Theranos has claimed it could run a battery of tests with just a few drops of blood, making it cheaper and less-painful than tests from Quest Diagnostics (DGX) and Laboratory Corp. of America (LH).The Theranos Wellness Centers were the largest source of revenue for the company.Theranos released the following statement Monday morning:""Quality and safety are our top priorities and we are working closely with government officials to ensure that we not only comply with all federal regulations but exceed them. We are disappointed that Walgreens has chosen to terminate our relationship and remain fully committed to our mission to provide patients access to affordable health information and look forward to continuing to serve customers in Arizona and California through our independent retail locations.""

18,DGX,"Analysts expect another solid quarter from INC Research Holdings (INCR) when it reports first-quarter results next week, but much of Wall Street’s focus is on how much longer the contract research organization will remain an independent company.INC’s future came under scrutiny earlier this month when Bloomberg reported the company has been in talks with Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH) about a possible merger.The Bloomberg story, citing unidentified sources, said INC and LabCorp have been in ""preliminary"" talks about a deal, but that the two companies “may choose not to proceed with a transaction.”
"
19,DGX,"No further details were provided, and neither company has commented on the matter.Even so, investors perked up when the news hit on April 18. INC’s stock price rose as much as 15% to a record high of 57.11 that day, on heavy volume. Shares later settled down to close at 49.68 -- near where they had been trading before word of a possible merger -- and still are hovering at that level.A deal between INC and LabCorp would make strategic sense for a few reasons, analysts say. For one, both are headquartered in North Carolina: INC in Raleigh, and LabCorp in nearby Burlington.Both companies also operate in the same type of business. INC provides contract research organization services that focus exclusively on Phase I through IV clinical development for the biopharma and medical device industries. LabCorp provides clinical lab tests and procedures through two segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.LabCorp is much the larger of the two, with a market cap of around $9.3 billion vs. about $2.7 billion for INC. LabCorp has been on the lookout for acquisition opportunities as a way of solidifying its position as the nation’s No. 1 diagnostics company, industry watchers say.In an April 21 research report, JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill quoted LabCorp Chief Executive Dave King as saying that ""M&A opportunities are going to be excellent in the next year,"" with targets in both the diagnostics and contract research segments. Last year his company acquired Covance for around $6 billion.""(King) said the priority for Covance is growing the clinical business (which INCR would do),""  said Gill, who covers LabCorp but not INC. ""Management has left open the possibility of doing another significant deal following last year’s Covance acquisition, saying its plan to deleverage further and resume share repurchases in the second half of this year is contingent on M&A opportunities.""Adding more scale in the late-stage contract research business ""would make strategic sense"" for LabCorp and provide needed revenue and cost synergies for the Covance business, Gill added.""We also note INCR has a lot of biotech exposure, which would complement Covance’s heavier focus on pharma,"" he said.At the same time, INC would make a valuable target for any company looking to rapidly expand its business, noted fellow JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson, who covers INC.""We expect INC to outgrow industry peers, aided by a diversified global footprint and therapeutic expertise in high-growth segments within clinical development, including (central nervous system), oncology and complex diseases,"" Peterson wrote.Regardless of whether LabCorp or some other industry heavyweight, like Quest Diagnostics (DGX), end up making a bid for INC, the recent rumors only underscore its value as an acquisition target.That value is partly due to INC’s strong financial performance. The company went public in November 2014. Since then, it has delivered four full quarters of double-digit or better earnings per share and revenue growth. That streak is expected to continue at least through 2016.INC is due to report first-quarter results before the open on May 2. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect year-over-year earnings to rise 26% to 53 cents a share and net service revenue to increase 12% to $237.8 million.During 2015's fourth quarter, INC reported earnings of 54 cents a share, topping consensus analyst views by 4 cents. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBITDA, climbed 40% to $56.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 23.4% from 18.9% the previous year.INC’s net service revenue for the quarter rose 13% to $241.4 million, also above expectations. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, net service revenue increased 17% year-over-year. The company also recognizes reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses as a separate revenue source.Meanwhile, INC continues to expand its operation. It has more than doubled its annual revenue over the past four years, and its employee count keeps growing. The company ended 2015 with a staff of 6,400, up from 5,600 at the end of 2014.""We have made significant announcements to our talent acquisition and training and development programs to support our continued growth in a competitive labor market,"" Chief Executive Jamie Macdonald said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect INC to report full-year 2016 earnings of $2.37 a share, up 19% from a year earlier. Earnings for 2017 are expected to rise another 17% to $2.77 a share.

21,DGX,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- As Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang stood gazing at the Martian surface -- a virtual reality simulation, of course -- he talked about a future for the company that investors should look forward to. Or so he says.At the company's annual GPU Technology Conference, which started here Tuesday, Huang said in his opening keynote address that Nvidia's focus will be even more centered around its core GPU (graphics processing unit) technology.GPUs provide graphics on computers, in video games and in various other applications. Nvidia competes mostly with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in this field, and No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is also among its rivals.Huang pitched several new hardware offerings -- based on the company's GPU technology -- which are positioned for the rapidly growing cloud computing sector that's currently dominated by Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), though Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is taking steps to grab market share.The workhorse unit will be the $129,000 DGx-1, a server-like device that's based around the company's next-generation GPU architecture, called Pascal. Huang said that DGx-1 was intended to further deep learning and artificial intelligence.""It's the world's first deep learning supercomputer,"" Huang said. Laughing repeatedly throughout the presentation, the Nvidia CEO compared his company's $129,000 product to other off-the-shelf options and said it would cost easily upward of $250,000 to replicate the new unit's performance.Companies such as Google and Microsoft won't get the first DGx-1 units, the CEO said. Instead, those will go to the ""pioneers of AI"" at schools such as Stanford University, New York University and the University of Toronto.""Deep learning is no longer just an app, not just a field,"" Huang said. ""We think this is so important, we think this is going to utterly change computing. We think it's a big deal.""The other cloud computing options the company revealed at the GTC conference included the new Tesla P100 GPU platform, which Huang touted as a ""miracle in five parts,"" referring to its design. Huang said that the company had succeeded in achieving a greater-than-10-fold increase in the P100's image processing capacity over its predecessor.Deep learning and artificial intelligence figured prominently in Huang's discussion of self-driving cars. Nvidia also announced that it had developed GPU-powered ""supercomputer"" hardware called the Drive PX2 that can be installed in any such vehicle.""If you have a supercomputer, you really ought to have a supercar,"" Huang said.The company's vision for self-driving vehicles is tied to having autonomous cars ""learn"" how to drive by using the data collected by the various on-board sensors and piping it to the cloud. Combined with the enormous amount of data from other vehicles, Huang told the audience that he believes DaveNet -- the company's name for its self-driving car AI -- will ultimately become a ""superhuman driver.""The Drive PX2 is based in part on a similar, though much larger, supercomputer developed by China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).Huang's far-reaching pitch to developers also included the announcement that Nvidia would stage a self-driving Formula One-style race, with 10 participants, sometime in the not-too-distant future.Nvidia stock, however, fell 5 cents on the stock market today, to 35.75. The company has the highest possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning it's performing among the top 1% of all stocks in such metrics as stock performance and sales and earnings growth. Nvidia stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at 33.16 on March 16 and is now up nearly 8%, so it's a bit extended.

51,DGX,"Genetic testing company Myriad Genetics (MYGN) hit a 52-week high on the stock market and got a couple of price-target increases Tuesday in the wake of its analyst day Monday.
"
52,DGX,"Myriad laid out a five-year plan to turn around its string of profit declines over the last five quarters. The business has been hit by two factors: the waning of publicity surrounding Angelina Jolie's use of Myriad's BRACAnalysis breast-cancer-gene test in 2013, and the Supreme Court decision invalidating some of its BRACAnalysis-related patents, which brought in low-priced competitors from Quest Diagnostics (DGX) and Bio-Reference Labs (recently acquired by Opko Health (OPK), among others.
"
53,DGX,"A big part of Myriad's five-year plan, then, is reducing its dependence on hereditary cancer testing. Management said that by 2020 that should account for less than half its business, due to growth in its tests for prostate cancer (for which it announced its first commercial customer), rheumatoid arthritis and melanoma, along with its companion-diagnostics business. Companion diagnostics involve partnering with drugmakers such as AstraZeneca (AZN) and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) to help identify patients who are genetically suitable to their drugs, both in clinical trials and in commercial treatment. Myriad is a partner in 37 such deals.
"
54,DGX,"Myriad said that this should lead to 10% compound annual revenue growth and 30% operating margin by 2020.

55,DGX,"The legacy hereditary cancer business also seems to be stabilizing, wrote Leerink analyst Dan Leonard in a research note Tuesday.
"
56,DGX,"""Myriad has been successful gaining long-term contracts from payers for its hereditary cancer testing business despite lower-priced competition,"" Leonard wrote. ""As of now, 45% of hereditary cancer revenue is derived from long-term (three-year) contract pricing, versus 25% at fiscal year 2014-end and 5% in fiscal year 2013-end, providing more pricing visibility from private payers... Hereditary cancer, in our view, remains the No. 1 investment debate on Myriad's stock.""
"

Mizuho Securities' Peter Lawson also stayed neutral but raised his price target to 38 from 32. Piper Jaffray's William Quirk raised his price target to 45 from 41 and affirmed his outperform rating, saying that the conversion of patients from the BRACAnalysis to the more complex MyRisk hereditary cancer test could bring upside to Myriad's forecast.

"
79,DGX,"Air Methods (AIRM) has seen that happen more than a few times — including twice in the past three months.
"
80,DGX,"The company provides air medical transport and other services via a fleet of owned and leased helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.
"
81,DGX,"At the end of 2013, its fleet consisted of 264 company-owned aircraft and 136 leased aircraft.
"
82,DGX,"Its Air Medical Services Division — the largest air medical transport provider in America — generates the lion's share of revenue. 
"
83,DGX,"Air Methods also has a Tourism Division that provides helicopter tours and charter flights in the Las Vegas/Grand Canyon region and in Hawaii. Another unit, United Rotorcraft, specializes in the design and manufacture of aeromedical and aerospace technology.
"
84,DGX,"But the air medical unit drives Air Methods' financial performance — and that business can be hard to predict.
"
85,DGX,"Planning For Emergencies
"
86,DGX,"Air Methods' medical business is divided into two basic service areas: hospital-based and community-based.
"
87,DGX,"Its hospital-based division provides medical helicopter and airplane services, primarily on fixed contracts paid by hospitals.
"
88,DGX,"With this business, Air Methods typically provides only the aircraft and the pilot.
"
89,DGX,"The main challenge with the hospital-based business is that foul weather can hamper Air Methods' ability to transport patients.
"
90,DGX,"""A lot depends on the weather — whether you can actually go in and respond,"" said Richard Close, analyst at Avondale Partners. ""Someone might call in for a helicopter, but if the visibility is really low you can't go out and get them. When it doesn't fly, it doesn't get paid.""
"
91,DGX,"The community-based service unit is designed to serve whole communities and operate independently of hospitals. Air Methods not only provides the aircraft and crew, but also critical-care medical staff trained in areas such as burns, cardiac, pediatrics, respiratory and trauma, and can help out with specialty-team transports.
"
92,DGX,"This side of the business carries higher margins than the hospital-based division. It's even more volatile because in addition to having to deal with the weather, Air Methods must handle issues with medical care and billing.
"
93,DGX,"As anyone in the health care business knows, billing for medical service doesn't necessarily mean getting the money.
"
94,DGX,"""There's a big variance in net revenue based on the payer mix — who has commercial insurance, who depends on Medicare, who has no insurance at all,"" Close told IBD. ""Not everyone pays on time, or even at all. That dynamic has a really big impact.""
"
95,DGX,"Air Methods saw the good and bad of it during the first two quarters of 2014.
"
96,DGX,"On Aug. 7, the company posted better-than-expected revenue and profit for the second quarter, and the next day its stock popped more than 12% to a record closing high of 59.81. Shares currently trade near 59.
"
97,DGX,"Less than three months earlier, on May 9, its stock price sank nearly 11%, a day after Air Methods fell short of Q1 earnings views.
"
98,DGX,"The results for both quarters weren't that surprising, Close says.
"
99,DGX,"""Traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are a little more challenging with respect to weather, so there's more volatility there,"" he said.
"
100,DGX,"Trends Lend A Lift
"
101,DGX,"The good news for Air Methods is that its second-quarter results reflected positive trends for the company, says CEO Aaron Todd.
"
102,DGX,"These include more hospitals outsourcing their transport services to a third party. ""We've seen an acceleration of that activity, and in a great majority of cases our hospital partners have chosen Air Methods to outsource,"" Todd told IBD. ""Second-quarter earnings reflect an underlying quality in that they were driven by positive trends and top-line expansion of more patients being transported.""
"
103,DGX,"Air Methods reported Q2 earnings of 73 cents a share, up 49% from the prior year and 7 cents above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue gained 14% to $258.5 million, also beating views.
"
104,DGX,"Revenue from the Air Medical Services Division rose 7% to $219.6 million, while tourism revenue nearly doubled to $31.4 million. Revenue from the United Rotorcraft unit climbed 51% to $7.4 million.
"
105,DGX,"Second-quarter total patient transports rose 7% to just less than 15,000, while net revenue per patient transport also improved 7% to $11,353.
"

"
112,DGX,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Air Methods to boost full-year earnings 75% in 2014 and an additional 20% in 2015.
"
113,DGX,"The firm is part of IBD's Medical Services industry group, which includes names such as Express Scripts (ESRX), a provider of pharmacy benefit management services; Laboratory Corp. of America (LH), which provides clinical testing services; and Quest Diagnostics (DGX), a testing services provider. Air Methods holds the top Composite Rating in the group —95 of a possible 99.When a big part of your business depends on unpredictable forces like the weather, how many emergencies happen and how medical bills get paid, you can expect a little earnings volatility.When you experience earnings volatility, you can expect to see your stock price bungee up or down from time to time.Air Methods (AIRM) has seen that happen more than a few times — including twice in the past three months.The company provides air medical transport and other services via a fleet of owned and leased helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.At the end of 2013, its fleet consisted of 264 company-owned aircraft and 136 leased aircraft.Its Air Medical Services Division — the largest air medical transport provider in America — generates the lion's share of revenue. Air Methods also has a Tourism Division that provides helicopter tours and charter flights in the Las Vegas/Grand Canyon region and in Hawaii. Another unit, United Rotorcraft, specializes in the design and manufacture of aeromedical and aerospace technology.But the air medical unit drives Air Methods' financial performance — and that business can be hard to predict.Planning For EmergenciesAir Methods' medical business is divided into two basic service areas: hospital-based and community-based.Its hospital-based division provides medical helicopter and airplane services, primarily on fixed contracts paid by hospitals.With this business, Air Methods typically provides only the aircraft and the pilot.The main challenge with the hospital-based business is that foul weather can hamper Air Methods' ability to transport patients.""A lot depends on the weather — whether you can actually go in and respond,"" said Richard Close, analyst at Avondale Partners. ""Someone might call in for a helicopter, but if the visibility is really low you can't go out and get them. When it doesn't fly, it doesn't get paid.""The community-based service unit is designed to serve whole communities and operate independently of hospitals. Air Methods not only provides the aircraft and crew, but also critical-care medical staff trained in areas such as burns, cardiac, pediatrics, respiratory and trauma, and can help out with specialty-team transports.This side of the business carries higher margins than the hospital-based division. It's even more volatile because in addition to having to deal with the weather, Air Methods must handle issues with medical care and billing.As anyone in the health care business knows, billing for medical service doesn't necessarily mean getting the money.""There's a big variance in net revenue based on the payer mix — who has commercial insurance, who depends on Medicare, who has no insurance at all,"" Close told IBD. ""Not everyone pays on time, or even at all. That dynamic has a really big impact.""Air Methods saw the good and bad of it during the first two quarters of 2014.On Aug. 7, the company posted better-than-expected revenue and profit for the second quarter, and the next day its stock popped more than 12% to a record closing high of 59.81. Shares currently trade near 59.Less than three months earlier, on May 9, its stock price sank nearly 11%, a day after Air Methods fell short of Q1 earnings views.The results for both quarters weren't that surprising, Close says.""Traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are a little more challenging with respect to weather, so there's more volatility there,"" he said.Trends Lend A LiftThe good news for Air Methods is that its second-quarter results reflected positive trends for the company, says CEO Aaron Todd.These include more hospitals outsourcing their transport services to a third party. ""We've seen an acceleration of that activity, and in a great majority of cases our hospital partners have chosen Air Methods to outsource,"" Todd told IBD. ""Second-quarter earnings reflect an underlying quality in that they were driven by positive trends and top-line expansion of more patients being transported.""Air Methods reported Q2 earnings of 73 cents a share, up 49% from the prior year and 7 cents above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue gained 14% to $258.5 million, also beating views.Revenue from the Air Medical Services Division rose 7% to $219.6 million, while tourism revenue nearly doubled to $31.4 million. Revenue from the United Rotorcraft unit climbed 51% to $7.4 million.Second-quarter total patient transports rose 7% to just less than 15,000, while net revenue per patient transport also improved 7% to $11,353.Much of the company's growth can be traced to the move by more hospitals to a community-based model to save costs, Close says.""Under a community-based contract, the costs for clinicians and other expenses get shifted to Air Methods, which has to hire the nurses and paramedics,"" he said.

132,DGX,"Gene-tester Myriad Genetics modestly beat fiscal Q4 estimates late Tuesday, but EPS guidance below consensus sent the stock falling 5% in after-hours trading.
"
133,DGX,"Revenue for the quarter that ended June 30 rose 8.4% over the year-earlier quarter to $188.8 million, less than $1 million above analysts' average estimate. Profit declined 9.5% to 48 cents a share, beating consensus by 2 cents.
"
134,DGX,"Myriad Genetics (MYGN) guided fiscal 2015 revenue at $800 million to $820 million, vs. last year's $778 million, with the midpoint shy of consensus of $815 million. Its EPS guidance range of $1.90 to $2 missed analysts' $2.12 and at the midpoint represents a 20% downturn from last year's $2.43.
"
135,DGX,"The shrinkage came from the decline in Myriad's BRACAnalysis test for genetic vulnerability to breast cancer, due to two factors. One was what Myriad's press release called ""a nonrecurring benefit from celebrity publicity in the fourth quarter of 2013 that resulted in increased testing volume for BRACAnalysis,"" referring to actress Angelina Jolie's public announcement in May 2013 that she'd had a preventive mastectomy after taking a BRACAnalysis.
"
136,DGX,"The company even quantified that benefit for the full fiscal 2013 at $55 million in revenue and 35-40 cents in earnings per share.
"
137,DGX,"The other factor was the Supreme Court's June ruling that invalidated some of Myriad's patents on BRACAnalysis on the grounds that the modified genes used in the test are ""products of nature"" and therefore unpatentable. Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Bio-Reference Laboratories (BRLI) and others quickly came out with their own versions of the tests, which induced the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to propose a drastic reimbursement cut. CMS later backed off of somewhat, but Myriad said that its reimbursement payments in the recent quarter were still 18% lower than a year earlier.
"
138,DGX,"Myriad's solution to this problem has been to try to convert people to its new MyRisk 25-gene panel, which evaluates the risk for multiple cancers at once and which the company says is more sensitive than older products.

278,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Jul 24.Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.41%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than the top line in the mid-to-high single digit range.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThe company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In first-quarter 2018, the company satisfied all five elements of the above-mentioned growth agenda and strongly expects to continue with the momentum going forward.Going by the first element of the growth strategy to inch up 1-2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, the company achieved this upside for the fifth consecutive year in 2017.In this regard, the recent buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. This transaction should further garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Accounting for the second element of the growth strategy — to expand relationships with hospital health systems — in April, Quest Diagnostics along with four other leading health care organizations, namely– Humana, MultiPlan and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum and UnitedHealthcare launched a pilot program applying blockchain technology to improve data quality and reduce administrative costs associated with changes to health care provider demographic data.In March, the company entered into a professional lab services agreement with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England.Considering the third element of the company’s growth strategy that offers the broadest access to diagnostic innovation, key growth drivers in the second quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening. We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build an esoteric testing business as well as boost profitability.About the fourth element of the growth strategy, which is to act as the provider of choice for consumers, the company’s relationship with Walmart has already started to add value with higher patient traffic and this positivity is expected to soon find reflections in its second-quarter earnings performance. The Walmart locations are helping Quest Diagnostics expand into different markets and the company expects to open many more locations throughout the ongoing year.The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics’ growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. According to the company, the inclusion of MedXM is allowing it to close gaps between patients and healthcare professionals.We expect these active growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.68 billion, slightly below the company’s projected band. Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected to be $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.61 falls within this guided range.On the flip side, after a persistently dull phasefor several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slim rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the unrelenting headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the effect of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get highlighted in the impending quarterly results.Overall, we believe that dearth of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously dent the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy recovers.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +1.33%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2.McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.95% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

279,DGX,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a roaring success in healthcare, taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm as well!These days, patients prefer bots for home-based medical services for easy, pocket friendly and faster recovery. Per a research report by the International Federation of Robotics, about 37,500 elderly-assistance medical robots will be sold worldwide by 2019 for home-based care.Apart from elderly care, AI has a role to play in United States’ fight against sexual offence, depression and cognitive-behavioral disorder. Such emergencies call for maintenance of privacy, anonymity and outpatient care.Further, the recent national epidemic of opioid abuse and President Trump’s fresh “tough on crime” policies are likely to drive the demand for outpatient rehab centers in the nation.Despite these factors, analysts apprehend that regulatory hurdles might slightly weigh on the global outpatient markets. Further, any slowdown in global economic growth, especially in the MedTech domain, might hurt demand for outpatient and home healthcare procedures.Industry Performance vs. S&P 500Despite the favorable socio-economic scenario, investors aren’t quite upbeat about the industry at the moment. Moreover, outpatient rehab centers do not provide assured cure for opioid abuse and drug overdose till now.This reflects in the underperformance of the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry, which is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, with respect to both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year.While stocks in this industry have collectively gained 3.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Medical Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 20.7%.One-Year Price Performance Outpatient and Home Healthcare Stocks Trading CheapGiven the industry’s underperformance so far this year, the valuation looks cheap now. Valuation is a tricky business for the Outpatient and Home Healthcare companies. Not to forget, these companies spend a lot on unplanned R&D and hence it is difficult to account for such high expenses.However, one might gain a fair idea of the industry’s relative valuation from its Price/Book ratio.The industry currently has a Price/Book TTM ratio of 2.14, which is toward the high end of the past year as well as the last five years. When compared to the high of 2.21 and median level of 1.95 over the past year, we believe investors should wait for a dip to enter the market.The space also looks inexpensive when compared to the Medical market at large, as the current Price/Book TTM ratio for the Medical sector is 2.56 and the median Price/Book TTM ratio is 2.39.Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Compared to the Zacks S&P 500 Composite, the space looks inexpensive. The current ratio for the S&P 500 of 3.92 and the median level is 3.75. So, both the figures are above the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Price Under Pressure Due to Bleak Earnings ViewThe ratio analysis shows that the industry has a solid value-oriented path ahead.The major factors driving this are mostly macroeconomic along with cost effectiveness. Middle-class Americans, i.e. more than 62% of the total population, generally avoid high service costs of expensive healthcare centers. They prefer treatments at home or at outpatient clinics to cut down on out-of-pocket expenses.One reliable metric that can give investors an idea of the industry’s future price performance is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, showing the earnings revision trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry Please note that the $3.08 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has been moving recently.This becomes clear by focusing on the aggregate EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see, the $3.08 EPS estimate for 2018 has remained steady since May, declining from $3.11 at April-end. Looking at the earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential. This could possibly be due to the regulatory hurdles in the outpatient industry.However, earnings estimates have risen sharply since last December.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #116, which places it within the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Moreover, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank was consistently in the top 50% for the past eight weeks.Outpatient And Home Healthcare Promises Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry indicate steady growth. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry of 13.4% appears promising. The corresponding figure for the Zacks S&P 500 composite is 9.8%.Though the group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has declined sharply from the high of 13.7% achieved in March and April 2018, it has been steady ever since and is above the low of 9.5% over a year.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be a steady increase in top line that the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry has seen since the end of 2016.  Bottom LineThe rapid adoption of outpatient services can be attributed to technological advancements, which have made procedures shorter and less complicated.A research report by the Transparency Market Research suggests that Americans are increasingly succumbing to drug addiction, which is affecting health and family life to a large extent. Outpatient rehabs have a major role to play since treatment is comparatively cheaper than inpatient and residential treatments. On the flip side, healthcare markets are facing innumerable regulations and interventions, which might mar the long-term prospects of the industry.However, keeping the long-term expectations in mind, investors could advantage from the cheap valuation and bet on a few outpatient and home healthcare stocks that have a strong earnings outlook.Here we pick two stocks from the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), out of which one has seen positive earnings estimate revision.DaVita Inc (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings inched down 0.2% in the last 60 days. DaVita has returned 13.2% in a year’s time.Price and Consensus: DVA Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report): Amedisys provides home health and hospice services throughout the United States to the growing chronic, co-morbid, and aging American population.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings moved up 1.7% in the last 60 days.

(CHE  -  Free Report): Chemed’s VITAS Healthcare segment provides hospice and palliative care services to patients with terminal illnesses.

280,DGX,"The price that the United States has to pay for being one of the most socially advanced nations is high-risk emergencies from sexual offence, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The country relentlessly puts up a fight against these medical issues that call for privacy, anonymity and home-based or Outpatient care. That’s not all. The recent national epidemic of Opioid abuse and President Trump’s fresh “tough on crime” policies to curb it are likely to increase the need for Outpatient rehab centers.Per Future Market Insights, the global Outpatient clinics market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.3% and reach $39,000 million by 2022, with America as a strong contributor.Here we discuss how Medical Outpatient and home healthcare have been creating opportunities for investors keen on parking their money in the healthcare space.What is Driving the Medical Outpatient Market?Growth of the global Outpatient clinics depends on various macroeconomic factors. A research report by Fierce Healthcare suggests that Outpatient care makes up at least 40% of the net U.S. health system spending.Cost Effectiveness of the Outpatient ServicesNotably, all the Outpatient and home-based care include immediate curative measures and do not require patients to stay for long hours at clinics or hospitals.The primary advantage of the Outpatient market is the huge service costs of the fancy healthcare organizations that are generally avoided by lower income groups. Middle-class Americans, i.e. more than 62% of the total population prefer visiting the Outpatient clinics to reduce out-of-pocket expenses.Technological AdvancementsThe rapid adoption of the Outpatient services can also be attributed to technological advances, which has made procedures quicker and less complicated.Outpatient Rehab & Treatment Centers A research report by the Transparency Market Research suggests that Americans are increasingly getting addicted to a variety of drugs, which are affecting health and family to a large extent. Outpatient rehabs have a major role to play, since treatment is comparatively cheaper than the inpatient and residential treatments.In this regard, MedTech behemoth DaVita Inc (DVA  -  Free Report) deserves a mention. In 2017, The Everett Clinic, a division of DaVita, received the Washington State Medical Association's (WSMA) highest award for patient safety in the category of excellence for their chronic opioid therapy work.DaVita’s internal efforts to curb unsafe opioid prescribing have been successful. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).So, here we take a look at three companies that are poised to gain from the rising influence of Outpatient services in healthcare.Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report)Chemed’s VITAS Healthcare segment provides hospice and palliative care services for patients with terminal illnesses. This type of care is aimed at making a terminally ill patient’s last days comfortable and painless.Hospice care is available for patients who have been initially certified or re-certified as terminally ill (a prognosis of six months or less) by their attending physician. VITAS offer all levels of hospice care in a given market, including routine home care, inpatient care and continuous care. More than 95% of the company’s revenues are derived through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.Chemed carries a Zacks Rank #3. Over the past three months, Chemed has been outperforming the industry. The stock has gained 16.9% compared with the industry’s 14.2% rise.  BioScrip, Inc (BIOS  -  Free Report)BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in the core Infusion Services business where it has a strong presence and enjoys competitive advantage. BioScrip witnessed consistent growth in this business primarily on account of strong organic growth particularly in chronic, nutrition and other therapies.To bolster the Infusion services business, BioScrip has taken a number of steps to focus on the core Infusion business.In the past three months, BioScrip has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have returned 14.3%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report)We are upbeat about the long-term growth prospects that are expected to deliver positive outcomes in the upcoming period. With baby boomers moving into Medicare and living longer, the company is benefiting from population growth and favorable demographics.Esoteric testing business is growing rapidly as physician medicine drives demand for advanced esoteric tests. Per an analysis by Research and Market, the global clinical laboratory testing market is expected to reach $198.5 billion by 2024.Year to date, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed the industry it belongs to, with 11.7% returns. Currently, it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

However, with the recently implemented PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rule, a persistent decline in healthcare utilization rate, softer volume, commercial pricing pressure and cutthroat competition in the niche space are denting the stock’s growth.Pressure on volume due to a difficult macro-economic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Nevertheless, we have observed some changes in the volume trend over the past couple of quarters. In the last reported quarter, volume measured by a number of requisitions increased 2.2% year over year, driven by acquisitions while organic growth remained essentially flat.Per the company, the impact of weather presented a headwind of approximately 60 basis points to volume in first-quarter 2018.We also expect a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives to continuously affect the company’s overall improvement until the economy rebounds.Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors responsible for continuously ailing Quest Diagnostics and also the brighter prospects indicating a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing Quest DiagnosticsComing back to PAMA, the year opened with the first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, accounting for approximately 12% of the company’s revenues last year. The company still expected the impact of the final rates under PAMA to cause an approximate 4% revenue reduction in 2018 while nearly 10% in both 2019 and 2020 as well.Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market compared with Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share.While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service including accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily on the basis of service quality.Why Should You Hold?We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to refocus on core diagnostic information services business and a disciplined capital deployment. The company’s latest acquisitions and collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers.We are also upbeat about the company entering into an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This extended pact will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the widened tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. Further, Quest Diagnostics’ merger and acquisition activity is being executed successfully. Recently, the company completed the acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services.In 2017, the company announced seven acquisition activities, which should help exceed Quest Diagnostics’ long-term M&A objective of 1-2% top-line growth for 2018. Among these buyouts, worth noting is the company’s recently-closed buyout of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic.Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry in a month's time. The stock has gained 9% compared with the industry's rise of 7.3%. Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical space is Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.3%.

282,DGX,"It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor. Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune? Let’s see what happened.On May 24, Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This expanded agreement will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the expanded tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. At the same time, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1. Meanwhile, LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) the next day. Per the expanded agreement, LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company’s members starting next year. The extended agreement will provide in-network access to LabCorp’s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members.According to CNBC, Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna’s members.Notably, both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts’ stocks have been trading higher than the S&P 500 index since May 24.Per Morgan Stanley’s analyst Ricky Goldwasser, these deals will result in the elimination of the long-time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term. He also commented ""... Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector.""Conforming to this idea, we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market. Let’s delve deeper.Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of $146.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2017 and 2022.Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this. Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, 8.5% of the global population is aged 65 years and above.Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market. According to an article published in Report Buyer, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022. Growing disposable income among the middle-class people along with increasing access to state-of-the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside.According to some analysts, technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year. Meanwhile, enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services.Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market.Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report): Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health develops and markets genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, enabling physicians and patients to make treatment-related decisions.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 226.4%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Secaucus, NJ, Quest Diagnostics is a leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the United States and globally.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings beat being 3.4%.DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or end stage renal disease. It also provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers.This Zacks Rank #3 company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 0.9%.PAMA: A DownerLike all other markets, the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with.Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations. In the last couple of years, several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues. Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS' (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories. As said by LabCorp earlier, the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement says, “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs.”However, per an article on GenomeWeb, companies like Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report), Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others, which have their own proprietary tests, will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

284,DGX,"Earnings reports for the second-quarter are pouring in. Results from 97 of the 500 S&P companies out already paint a strong earnings picture, which is likely to look rosier over the course of this reporting cycle.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for the S&P 500 members constituting 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization — reported so far are up 8.4% year over year on a 5.1% rise in revenues. Going by the scorecard, 78.4% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 72.2% surpassed revenue estimates.Healthcare falls within the Medical ambit, which is one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group. As of Jul 19, 3.6% of the total Medical sector reported second-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 100% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.The sector has been in the limelight since the change of power at the White House. President Donald Trump, who is eager to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act more popularly known as Obamacare, has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty. The stocks continue to be in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing to meet with much success and basically collapsing.In the meantime, the healthcare corner continues to benefit from patients gained under Obamacare. Players in the industry are also actively engaged in mergers and acquisitions to achieve fast-paced growth. New product launch, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses, and cost control measures will accrue to the top line.Nevertheless, high bad debt, increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions will put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a peek at these healthcare companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 25.HCA Healthcare, Inc.

287,DGX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Adjusted Earnings rose 6.8% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, debt redemption premium and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for foreign exchange tailwind of 2 cents, adjusted EPS was $1.44.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported net earnings of $1.07 per share, compared to 84 cents in the previous year.Full-year adjusted EPS came in at $4.77, a 4% improvement from the year-ago number. This also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 per share.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $8.14 billion, up 6.5% on an organic basis (up 2.9% on a reported basis). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion. Organic revenues in the quarter include adjustments for divestitures of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression) and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health and a $315 million positive impact from foreign currency.Fiscal 2018 worldwide revenues were $29.95 billion, up 4.6% on an organic basis (up 0.8% on a reported basis). This also remained ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.76 billion.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 5.3% after adjusting for the divestitures) to $4.19 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.72 billion (33% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.6% increase organically (up 10.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15% of total revenues) amounted to $1.24 billion, up 15.5% organically (up 16.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 5.4% at constant exchange rate or CER (up 10.1% as reported) to $3.14 billion, driven by strong, low-teens growth in CSH, mid-single digit growth in APV, and low-single digit growth in CRHF, all at CER.CRHF sales totaled $1.63 billion, up 1.5% year over year at CER (up 5.8% as reported). This came on the back of low-single digit growth in Arrhythmia Management. This apart, double digit growth in AF Solutions, Mechanical Circulatory Support, and TYRX in Infection Control also contributed to the growth.CSH revenues were up 12.8% at CER (up 18.7% as reported) to $81.01 billion on the back of low-20s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4.8% growth at CER (up 8.8% as reported) to $497 million, driven by low-single digit growth in both Aortic and Peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.24 billion, marking a 4.8% year-over-year increase at CER (down 14.1% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at comparable CER basis.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $2.13 billion were up 6.1% year over year at CER (up 9% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies and Pain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in the Spine business.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 21.3% at CER (26% as reported) to $645 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 136 basis points (bps) to 70.6% on a 4.9% rise in gross profit to $5.7 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 64 bps year over year to 29.7% owing to a 7.1% rise in research and development expenses (to $592 million) along with a 2.9% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.55 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $188 million as compared with $48 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceThe company has provided its fiscal 2019 earnings and revenues guidance. For the full year, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 4-4.5%. Currency fluctuation is expected to negatively impact the top line by $50 million- $150 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $31.05 billion.Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.15, a 10% growth from the year-ago number at the mid-point of the range. This assumes a 5 cent benefit from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 per share falls at the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth quarter performances. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report).

288,DGX,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after market close on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28.2%. Moreover, the company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.6%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsResMed is expected to gain from a strong performance on the domestic as well as international front like the previous quarter. In the past few earnings, the company’s domestic revenues were driven by solid growth in devices and masks as well as a continued double-digit software sales rise. Moreover, the sleep apnea patient volume consistently witnessed steady growth. We expect these trends to find reflection in the impending third-quarter results as well.Internationally, revenues across Europe, Asia and other markets are likely to register a solid increase, banking on a strong device and masks performance. Within devices, sleep apnea patient volume should continue to expand through the company’s marketing efforts and channel partners. In Canada and Latin America, a sturdy uptake of AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform should further add value to the company’s portfolio.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. Quote In France, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism in the stock. The company believes, this reimbursement grant will continue to drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company keeps investing and expanding its footprint in the high-growth markets of China, South Korea, India, Brazil and several countries in Eastern Europe.Within mask and accessories outside the United States, the company is expected to benefit from nasal and full face categories, namely AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20, respectively.Per ResMed, with more than 1.5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data, the company is successfully working on simplifying workflow and improving patient outcomes. This improvement should drive the company’s top-line performance in the quarter, yet to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $217 million for international revenues indicates a rise of 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.Domestically, ResMed is extremely upbeat about the latest tax reform, which sees a transformation into a territorial tax system. This  in fact allows the company to invest its global cash assets without any artificial constraints. Per ResMed, it is now free to invest in three new ways: firstly, growing upon its existing strong U.S. manufacturing footprint; secondly, expanding its existing U.S.-based research and development capability and finally, building upon its existing valuable U.S.-based intellectual property assets. Effective January, this is expected to remain accretive to the company’s operational result in the fiscal third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million for domestic revenues (including contributions from Brightree) reflects an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other Factors Likely to Influence ResMed's Q3ResMed continues to progress on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company diligently aims at growth in the adjacent product and geographic markets including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other respiratory disorders as well as the emerging markets of China, India and Brazil. ResMed still considers portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products.Moreover, since ResMed’s acquisition of Brightree in fiscal 2016, the former has strongly progressed with the latter’s software-as-a-service business’ latest offerings targeting the home health and hospice market. We expect this upside to further boost ResMed’s top line in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.7 million for Brightree revenues marks an increase of 13.4% from the year-ago quarter.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.ResMed has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of +0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Thus, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

290,DGX,"Healthcare diagnostic majors and arch-rivals Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp are on the same page regarding the much contentious topic of Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) on clinical lab fee schedule. Recently, both the companies as members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) have come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The lawsuit charged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under the purview of HHS, have failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Per the lawsuit claims, CMS ignored the Congress directives stated under PAMA and instituted a highly flawed data reporting process of setting market rates in advance.This prohibited the overwhelming majority of laboratories from reporting the private payer data used to determine Medicare rates for lab tests. The move has instead resulted in new Medicare lab rates, which are not market-specific. Hence, the entire process clearly demonstrates CMS’ failure to protect access to laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries.Per the press release from LabCorp, if the new rates are allowed to come into effect, it will affect the Medicare beneficiaries as well as disrupt the healthcare system. Per Quest diagnostics, “this flawed process could cause serious financial harm to potentially thousands of hospitals, independent and physician office laboratories and make it harder for Medicare beneficiaries to get access to medical testing, particularly in remote rural areas and in nursing homes that depend on laboratory testing services”. Earlier during the third quarter earnings release, both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics had issued certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by CMS on the proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by PAMA. Per the companies, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prevented from reporting their rates.The above-mentioned 1% of laboratories majorly denoted independent labs. To convey the severity of the situation in clear terms, Quest Diagnostics stated that based on data submitted through CMS, the company alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data that CMS collected.Among other possibly badly hit clinical laboratories, thanks to the latest CMS mandate on clinical lab fee schedule, two names emerge as DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). While Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp and PerkinElmer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), DaVita has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

291,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of Shiel Medical Laboratory from Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (FMS  -  Free Report) — a healthcare company working on renal and other chronic conditions. The Shiel lab specifically serves the New York-New Jersey area. The latest development is expected to drive Quest Diagnostics’ operational excellence in the quarters to come.The region will now be served by Quest Diagnostics’ flagship clinical laboratory in Teterboro, NJ. The takeover is expected to expand the company’s patient service center network in the area.Quest Diagnostics and Fresenius Medical will now work on identifying patients with early-stage chronic kidney diseases, leveraging on the former’s laboratory data analytics.  Focus on AcquisitionsQuest Diagnostics’ mergers and acquisitions are expected to be key growth drivers. The company has of late been focusing on driving growth and operational efficiency through acquisitions. We note that the company recently completed the buyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals — The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut.Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have been major growth drivers. We are also particularly upbeat about the company’s deal with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). The company is particularly positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to driive growth in 2017. Also, management is optimistic about the latest acquisitions of Med Fusion and ClearPoint to advance in the diagnostics space. We are also encouraged by the company’s plan to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of its M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnostics’ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Stock Performance & Estimate Revision TrendQuest Diagnostics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last year, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 6.6%, in contrast to the broader industry’s decline of 5.5%.The company’s recent earnings estimate revision has been encouraging.

292,DGX,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) presented encouraging data from two studies on its second-generation prognostic gene expression test for breast cancer — EndoPredict. The results were presented at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in Texas.Per the company, the data from these studies demonstrated the test’s ability to predict residual cancer burden to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to neuroendocrine therapy in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients from ABCSG34. The results also confirmed EndoPredict’s ability to effectively predict the distant recurrence in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) compared to those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We believe these findings will drive the uptake of EndoPredict.Developments in EndoPredict TestsMyriad Genetics has been gaining from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA, Prolaris and EndoPredict tests, all of which make up a major part of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.In March, the company has been receiving encouraging response since the launch of the EndoPredict test in the United States for early-stage breast cancer. In August, Myriad Genetics received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem, Inc., one of the largest private insurers in the United States. Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients.The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first-generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in patients determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index.Market PotentialPer a report by DPI Research on Medium, the breast cancer screening market in the United States is expected to reach a value of roughly $5.8 billion by 2022. Moreover, per an article by BreastCancer.Org, approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in women are likely to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. They also project 63,410 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer this year as well.We believe an ageing population, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the breast cancer screening market. However, this market is dominated by a number of well-established players, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Quest Diagnostics’ Quest Vantage services help in the discovery of genetic variants related to the hereditary risk of 15 types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and renal.Share Price PerformanceMyriad Genetics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry.

293,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 13.68%. It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 5.15%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPosing a threat to Quest Diagnostics’ revenue per requisition performance, the last reported first-quarter 2017 saw a 20-basis points (bps) decrease in the same. Moreover, we remain apprehensive, as the company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagement, WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.This apart, unit price headwinds had  less than 100 bps in the first quarter. While unit price headwinds stayed in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for 2017 too.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteAlso, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). However, while reimbursement pressure has likely acted as an overhang on performance in the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to beat the pressure through test and business mix.On a positive note, as observed in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to stimulate performance by adhering to its two-point growth strategy – Accelerate growth and Drive operational Excellence.We are also optimistic about the successful execution of the company’s strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Also, in the recent past, Quest Diagnostics witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the second quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues within the range of $7.64 billion to $7.72 billion (annualized growth of 2–3%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, close to the low end of the company’s guided range. In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted earnings per share have been forecasted between $5.45 and $5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.41 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

295,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) recently announced completion of the previously announced buyout of Cleveland HeartLab. This is in line with the company’s plan to establish a national center of excellence in diagnostic information services at Cleveland HeartLab's 25,000-square feet specialized laboratory in Cleveland, OH.Per the company, the national center of excellence will be focusing on heart disease diagnostics. Moreover, the combined firms will integrate Quest Diagnostics' Cardio IQ lipid particle analysis and genetic and metabolic testing expertise with Cleveland HeartLab's strength in personalized evaluation of heart disease risk based on inflammation and other markers.Focusing on heart disease diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics announced itself as the first national diagnostic services provider that enhances accuracy of heart disease screening along with customizing treatment with lipid-lowering medications like PCSK9 inhibitors and statins by utilizing LDL-cholesterol calculation.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further strengthened by data provided by GBI Research.Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019. Within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%. Thus, in view of the current market potential, we believe that the company’s efforts will help boost the top line.We are also optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services. Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers in the past. In this regard, we are encouraged by the company’s completion of thebuyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals — The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. The company has also completed the acquisition the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise. Moreover, the company’s agreement to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and plans to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare buoy optimism.We are also upbeat about Quest Diagnostics and Clinical Genomics, a major player in the field of colorectal cancer detection, jointly announcing the FDA clearance of the latter’s InSure ONE. Notably, with the FDA approval, Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians, organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States. InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018. This development is in line with Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to grow in cancer diagnostics.Quest Diagnostics’ relationship with PeaceHealth is well on track. This partnership entails the acquisition of the outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska. This relationship is fully operational and is contributing to Quest Diagnostics’ top line.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnostics’ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through accretive acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Share Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

Moreover, buoyed with the continued strong adoption of INTUITY Elite valve system, management expects INTUITY Elite valve system sales to remain on track to account for 25% of global aortic sales in fiscal 2018.Per management, in January 2018, the company had rolled out INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in the United States.

298,DGX,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the market opens on Apr 18. Last quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%. Moreover, Abbott has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory inthe Medical Devices business. The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Historically, the company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of contributions from FreeStyle Libre. This apart, investors are confident about Abbott’s developments in other businesses which form part of the Medical Devices segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical Devices revenues of $2.68 billion indicates a rise of 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.Similar to the prior quarter, Abbott is expected to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. Management expects high single-digit sales growth in the first quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.09 billion shows a rise of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteWe are also upbeat about the Diagnostics business which has been going strong on solid contributions from all sub-segments — Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care. Moreover, synergies from the Alere buyout, in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics, have been benefiting the company.Moreover, management expects Rapid Diagnostics to contribute around $5 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diagnostic revenues of $1.76 billion shows a rise of 51.7% from the year-ago quarter.We encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott’s fastest-growing business, courtesy of an aging population, increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets. Furthermore, Abbott’s pediatric nutrition business continues to be strong in the United States. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nutrition revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a rise of 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.Favorable currency translation also had a positive impact of 2% on total revenues in the last reported quarter. We encouragingly note that management expects foreign exchange to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter, driving the top line by 3.5%.Overall, first-quarter total revenues are projected at $7.26 billion, up 14.5% from the prior-year quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

299,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, delivering a positive surprise of 0.73%. Also, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.83%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its two-point growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than revenues in the mid-to-high single digit range.The company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In this regard, we take a note of two recent strategic M&As by Quest Diagnostics. First, the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab, which should help strengthen the company’s position in the New York metropolitan marketplace. Second, the buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM, which should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. These two transactions should garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business as well as boost profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results, having thus remained active throughout. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the first quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, ahead of the company’s projected range.Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected in the band of $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.10 falls below this guided range.On the flip side, after a phase of continual drag for several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the persistent headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the impact of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get reflected in the first-quarter results.Overall, we believe that lack of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously affect the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy turns around for better.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +3.19%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.

300,DGX,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3%. Also, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter average earnings miss is 16.5%.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported quarter’s revenues dropped 2.1% year over year. Apart from sluggishness at the U.S. & Canada segments, declining revenues at the Manufacturing/Wholesale segment led to this downside. In the absence of any growth catalyst, we expect a similar trend in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, GNC Holdings has a number of competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, supermarket firms and big U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we anticipate the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which in turn, might hurt margins.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. Quote However, on the bright side,GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key growth driver for the company in recent years. Revenues at this segment increased 14.1% on higher cross-border e-commerce sales in China last quarter.In March 2018, the company announced plans to expand its presence in India. The company operates in collaboration with the master franchise partner, Guardian Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd, in the country.Per the latest announcement, Guardian will add GNC Holdings’ products to 4000-plus stores across India by 2020. In this regard, 1000 new stores are expected to shelf GNC products in 2018 compared with approximately 50 retail locations at present. This apart, the company has been targeting other channels like retailing, e-commerce and distribution for expansion.Of late, the company has been experiencing solid growth in China. In this regard, last December, GNC Holdings announced plans of entering into a strategic partnership and joint-venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the company witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tension between United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports has raised concerns for  MedTech players as any adverse move may affect their sales performance in China in near term.Furthermore, the performance of One New GNC is improving gradually. Notably, in 2017, more than 11 million consumers joined the company's loyalty programs. PRO Access, the company’s premium loyalty offering, enrolled nearly 850,000 members since its launch in March 2017. Apart from this, management is working on product pricing and innovation. Meanwhile, new consumer enrolment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.GNC Holdings has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 20 cents reflects a 45.9% plunge on a year-over-year basis.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

302,DGX,"The first-quarter earnings season is in its nascent stage with a handful of S&P 500 participants having released results so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, a bullish run is expected for the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Apr 16, 56 S&P 500 members reported their financial numbers.Total earnings for the companies are expected to increase at a highly impressive 16.6% rate on a year-over-year basis, thereby marking an improvement from last quarter’s reported growth of 13.4%. However, total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%, a decline from an 8.6% year-over-year rise in the fourth quarter of 2017.With the current earnings season gradually picking up its pace, this week seems to roll out a busy roster. Per the Zacks report, 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will likely register a year-over-year bottom-line improvement this quarter.Healthcare at a GlanceOne of those mentioned above is the Medical sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the year 2018 has provided ample reasons for the entire U.S. healthcare spectrum to cheer from the standpoint of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was finally signed by President Donald Trump on Dec 22. Among many other changes, corporate tax rates were slashed to 21% from the earlier 35%. This apart, the new legislation has almost doubled the standard deduction.Why is the MedTech Fraternity Happy?While the broader healthcare sphere is content with these huge tax reductions, the scenario within the Medical Device space, which is integral to healthcare, appears equally bright, courtesy of the Senate’s decision to defer implementing an industry-wide excise tax for another couple of years, known as the Medical Device tax.Significantly, the tax will be effective Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022. The repealing of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investments among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, there instilling investors’ optimism in them.Against this backdrop, eager investors await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week.Let’s get a glimpse of the major Medical device stocks scheduled to release quarterly reports on Oct 26:Per the quantitative Zacks model, stocks with the desirable combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of beating estimates.

304,DGX,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) also known as LabCorp, is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.38%. It has an average trailing four-quarter beat of 2.87%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp is likely to repeat its success trend from the last quarter. The company is expected to gain from a strong LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the period to be reported, banking on a favorable price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume. Particularly, we are looking forward to the company’s partnership with Mount Sinai and the former owners of Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML), Providence and Catholic Health. Earlier, the company anticipated these three partnerships to benefit from a full-year ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million as incremental profitable revenues in 2018. We expect this likely upside to get reflected in first-quarter results itself.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Within Covance Drug Development, we note that after a dull show for several quarters, the segment has started to report revenue growth from third-quarter 2017 onward on the back of the Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and a favorable foreign currency translation. With its buyout, Chiltern proved accretive to LabCorp’s portfolio, adding highly complementary capabilities to the company’s offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific belt, a broader reach in the fast-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segments as well as expertise in the oncology drug development. All these factors should together continue to benefit the top line at LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.Significantly, the company is putting more emphasis on creating new growth opportunities in women's health, medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing apart from critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe. Within Covance Drug Development, LabCorp expects these efforts to help fortifying its book-to-bill and net orders, driving its 2018 revenue conversion in the process.Also, the multi-year project LaunchPad, a business process improvement initiativeof LabCorp looks promising. The company’s last-year savings already achieved $20 million from the platform and further projects an additional net savings of $130 million through the three-year period ending in 2020, thereby substantially expanding the Drug Development margins.However, downsides might surface from the ongoing reimbursement issue. As stated by the company, the new PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rates published by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement the market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement reads that “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs”.We are therefore quite apprehensive about the entire scenario amid this current uproar. If the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS finally gets enforced sans amendment in favor of the testing laboratories, the continuation of LaunchPad, the projected growth at Covance, benefits from the Chiltern purchase and that from PAML and Mount Sinai plus the Covance LaunchPad process will all be offset by reduced PAMA rates.Per LabCorp’s previously provided guidance for 2018, revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 9.5-11.5% from 2017 including a likely improvement of 60 bps from a positive foreign currency movement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.48 billion. Adjusted EPS outlook for 2018 has been projected in the $11.30-$11.70 range. The consensus mark of $11.55 for the metric falls within the company’s forecast.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

305,DGX,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the markets open.Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Zimmer Biomet missed the consensus mark in two of the preceding four quarters, the average being 0.29%. .Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsThe company is expected to report strong topline numbers within its S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm in the to-be-reported period. Last quarter, revenues at S.E.T. were driven by solid quarterly sales of the company’s surgical portfolio. Also, within upper extremities business, the company saw solid demand for a comprehensive shoulder line.In this regard, we note that since last November, the company has received several FDA clearances within S.E.T. and is particularly, excited about the approval of the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder system. We expect all these developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote On the flip side, the company’s business within S.E.T has been in the recent past, massively ailed by supply issues and a continued pricing pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $435 million for S.E.T. revenues reflects a decline of 4.2% from the last quarter.We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from a strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Also, we are looking forward to top-line contributions from the company’s recent launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States.However, we are apprehensive about the ongoing revenue dissynergies related to the company’s U.S. spine sales force integration. Although Zimmer Biomet is working to resolve the impact of these dissynergies, chances of any near-term resolution are bleak.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million for Spine revenues indicates a 4.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.Overall, first-quarter revenues are projected at $2.03 billion, up 0.9% sequentially.Other factors likely to influence Zimmer Biomet’s first-quarter results are:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. We are also enthusiastic about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September. The knee system marked the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $700 million for Knee revenues registers a 4.2% reduction from the last quarter.Within Hip business, we expect the company to once again demonstrate a sturdy performance in the Asia Pacific region. Notably, in the previous quarter, the company registered double digit sales growth within Hip in the aforementioned geography. The company is anticipated to produce improved quarterly sales from Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems. However, like all other segments, supply constraints should continue to limit Zimmer Biomet’s ability to meet demand of these high-growth brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478 million for Knee revenues represents a 4.2% dip from the last quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in the other emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) zones. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from EMEA of $477 million denotes an improvement of 0.8% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $300 million from APAC in the quarter to be reported translates into a 6.5% fall from the last quarter. We believe, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting the company’s sales for over the past few quarters. The company has also been burdened with pricing woes.As a result, Zimmer Biomet struggled with a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.5% in 2017. In absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might be mirrored in the company’s first-quarter results.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank #4, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Therefore, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

306,DGX,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.89%. Moreover, Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.08%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand. Particularly, the company’s acquisition of FEI has been largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio over the past year. The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study as well as facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly, $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Quote Following the completion of the deal, the company has launched a host of products and expanded its Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform within the scope of material science applications. This should also get reflected in first-quarter 2018 performance.Apart from FEI-related development, another notable unveiling in the company’s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors called the iQ Series. This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. This in turn is likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Waltham MA-based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the period to be reported, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as a robust volume expansion plus productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at $1.138 billion, higher than the year-ago figure of $1.05 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s first-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the first quarter.The company had spent $900 million on research and development in 2017 and the same trend is continuing through 2018. We expect all innovations and product introductions to substantially drive the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also leads to solid results. Recent standout contributors are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain a bullish momentum for 2018.Moreover, growth is estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher facing a foreign exchange headwind on 2018 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition consistently poses challenges to the stock’s value.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Thermo Fisher has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of -1.29%, which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. This is because a company needs positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus this combination does not suggest that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to outpace expectations this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

307,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) and Clinical Genomics, a major player in the field of colorectal cancer detection, jointly announced the FDA clearance of the latter’s InSure ONE.With the FDA approval, Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians, organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) across the United States. InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018. This development will remain a part of Quest Diagnostics’ consistent effort to successfully pave its way through the growing field of cancer diagnostics.As a useful at-home collection fecal immunochemical test (FIT), InSure ONE improves compliance for screening programs. Among other InSure FIT tests, InSure ONE detects human hemoglobin from blood in fecal samples to aid in the detection of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. While other FIT tests require two samples, InSure ONE needs just a single specimen to run the screening successfully.Given the fact that FIT has been accepted as the guideline recommended for screening programs for an early detection of adenomatous polyps, precursors to cancer and colorectal cancer (in individuals of average risk starting at age 50 years), the role of InSure FIT tests is gaining more importance by the day. Considering this situation, both the companies view that this uncomplicated procedure of InSure ONE may better fix the problem of patient non-participation for screening programs as well.The latest strategic development with Clinical Genomics is in sync with Quest Diagnostics’ goal to gain a leadership position in the high-potential global oncology diagnostic market. Notably, Quest Diagnostics has recently acquired Med Fusion and Clear Point forming a national precision oncology center of expertise. Per the data provided by American Cancer Society, nearly 1.7 million people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the United States by the end of 2017. Also, per Markets and Markets, the global cancer diagnostics market is expected to reach a level worth $13.1 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 12.9% during 2015-2020. Accordingly, we are upbeat about a promising customer adoption rate of InSure ONE down the line.Quest Diagnostics outperformed the broader industry with respect to share price movement over the past six months. As per the last share price movement, the company has lost 14.5% in this period, narrower than the 17.2% loss of the broader industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Myriad Genetics, Inc.

308,DGX,"The healthcare sector is fast catching up with the digital revolution. Some of the trending hashtags in the healthcare space are #3DPrinting #BigDataAnalytics #BioPrinting and #ArtificialIntelligence, with #Blockchain being one of the favorites.Now, let’s take a look at how blockchain technology has been opening up avenues for investors who are keen on betting on the healthcare space.Blockchain’s Claim to FameBlockchain came into the limelight as the underlying technology for the most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin.An article on Investor’s Business Daily has defined blockchain technology as a shared public ledger, also known as a distributed database, which tracks and records transactions in a transparent and tamper-proof way.The estimates for the uptake of this technology are mind-boggling. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report) expects blockchain systems to record transactions for about 10% of worldwide GDP by 2027. Furthermore, Gartner Group believes blockchains have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, with that likely to swell to $21 billion, $176 billion and $3.1 trillion by 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively (per the article on Investor’s Business Daily).Blockchain and HealthcareGiven the rising need for integrating data across plans and providers, the Healthcare sector is poised to gain the most from blockchain’s distributed ledger technology. This hi-end technology has the power to revive the healthcare industry by reorganizing operations, generating new business models and integrating patients’ medical records.On Apr 2, leading health care companies like Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), MultiPlan, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum and UnitedHealthcare formed an alliance to launch a pilot program on this revolutionary technology. This program will study how the technology can be applied to cut down costs related to data management along with enhancing data quality and accuracy.In February, a Medicalchain ICO project, leveraging on the blockchain technology to maintain health records, was launched. Medicalchain allows different organizations like doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers to seek permission for accessing a patient’s health record and store these transactions on the distributed ledger.3 Major Factors Driving the Blockchain & Healthcare IntegrationSystems for recording and managing medical data are slow, centralized and often extremely vulnerable. This in turn leads to a chain of issues that are adversely impacting overall healthcare services. Let’s discuss such problems in detail.Escalating Administrative CostsDoctors, hospitals and diagnostic information service providers, all have been shelling out roughly $2.1 billion every year to manage and hold records of healthcare provider data.We take a note that, recently a major alliance has been formed between Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). The corporate behemoths came together to put a check on spiraling medical treatment costs by forming an independent health care company for employees in the United States.Medical Error — Leading Cause of DeathU.K.-based publisher of medical journals and clinical research, BMJ stated in a 2016 podcast that around 250,000 deaths every year in the United States are caused by medical errors (per an article on Crypto Currency News). The blockchain technology gives providers instant and complete access to a patient’s medical records.Growing Need to Strengthen Data SecurityThere is a growing need for healthcare organizations to prevent data hacking and phishing while maintaining confidentiality of patient’s health information. In this regard, a Cognizant research report states that around 49% of respondents in a survey stated that the transparent and tamper-proof nature of the transactions stored using the blockchain technology platform helps enhance customer satisfaction.Challenges Impeding the TransitionSince blockchain is a relatively new technology, it indeed is a challenge for key decision makers to understand its functionality and applicability.One of the most common problems faced by adopters of this technology is to maintain and streamline operations between different blockchains. Complicating the situation is the availability of various networks, each with different market strategies and structures. These networks are continuously competing to become the TCP/IP standard for blockchain. Per a Cognizant report, 62% of the respondents have cited this issue as a major bottleneck.Legal and regulatory issues also make adoption of this technology tough. Per a Cognizant report, healthcare payers and providers need to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards for governing the privacy and availability of Protected Health Information which impedes the uptake of blockchain.  Wrapping UpBlockchain technology holds immense potential to completely alter the healthcare space by addressing the key issues plaguing it.  In the words of Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld, blockchain “is the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade.”Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

309,DGX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Quest Diagnostics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Quest Diagnostics’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Quest Diagnostics has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Quest Diagnostics stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Quest Diagnostics has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DGX is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Quest Diagnostics currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Quest Diagnostics a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Quest Diagnostics might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B. This gives DGX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 10.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has surged 9.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and Consensus  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and Consensus | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteNotably, the stock has a long term expected earnings growth of 8.4% and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). These mixed expectations indicate that while the stock’s growth story might be good over the long term, analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future. Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePremier is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Bottom Top 20% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Meanwhile, the Care Coordination segment saw an improvement of 32% (29% at cc).Fresenius Medical Care Corporation Price and Consensus  Fresenius Medical Care Corporation Price and Consensus | Fresenius Medical Care Corporation QuoteEMEA RevenuesRevenues in the region increased 6% on a year-over-year basis at cc. Health Care Services revenues from the EMEA segment increased 5% at cc on a year-over-year basis. Health Care Products revenues rose 7% at cc in the third quarter.The Health Care Services segment was primarily driven by growth in same-market treatments, partially offset by a decline in organic revenue per treatment.

Net Health Care Services Unit grew 21% at cc. Meanwhile, Health Care Products Business increased 9% at cc on a year-over-year basis.

We note that Health Care Services segment at the region decreased 1%, while Health Care Products increased 9% year over year.Despite a lackluster performance in the company’s renal pharmaceutical unit, higher sales of machines and disposables and Dialysis treatments drove revenues in Latin America. Precisely, Dialysis treatments increased 1% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter in this region.Major Q3 HighlightsFresenius Buys NxStage MedicalIn an initiative to boost its long-term ‘Growth-Strategy 2020,’ Fresenius signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage Medical (NXTM  -  Free Report) for $30 a share in August. The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018.Fresenius expects the acquisition to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure. Furthermore, the deal is expected to provide annual pretax cost savings of $80 million to $100 million over the next three to five years. Fresenius also expects integration costs of about $150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement. Per management, the takeover will boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment (read more: Fresenius Medical Inks $2B Deal to Take Over NxStage Medical).Divestment of Shiel Medical LaboratoryIn an initiative to optimize its portfolio, Fresenius announced the divestiture of its Shiel Medical unit to Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) in September. Notably, Shiel is a clinical laboratory provider primarily focusing on non-renal lab services. The lab specifically serves in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. Management at Fresinius expects the transaction to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.Post the deal closure, Quest Diagnostics and Fresenius will jointly work on identifying patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease, with potential to benefit from treatment to slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), based on the former’s laboratory data analytics (read more: Quest Diagnostics to Buy Shiel to Widen Footprint in NY-NJ).GuidanceFor full-year 2017, Fresenius reiterated its guidance. The company estimates revenue growth of 8-10% at cc. Net income attributable to shareholders is likely to increase around 7-9%.Our TakeFresenius ended the third quarter on a dismal note missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. However, the company reiterated its full-year guidance. We believe this is in tune with the ‘Growth Strategy 2020’, under which it aims to boost revenues to $28 billion by 2020, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of around 10%.A wide range of dialysis products, initiatives to gain market traction, strengthen international foothold, strategic acquisitions and divestments act as major catalysts for the company. However, a lackluster performance by the renal pharmaceutical unit is likely to dent Latin-American revenues. Having a strong international foothold, Fresenius faces a highly regulated environment in almost every country in which it operates.Furthermore, the company has to fulfill specific legal requirements that include tough antitrust regulations. Thus, regulatory hurdles and competition in the niche markets are major headwinds.Peer ReleasePetMed Express, Inc.’s (PETS  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were up 79.2% from the year-ago quarter. Also, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43.3%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

311,DGX,"On Mar 7, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report). Amid huge reimbursement concerns, the company focuses on potentially strong areas. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Quest Diagnostics have outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has gained 6.6% against the broader industry’s 2.2% decline. We are encouraged to note that in recent times, Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. The company lends attention to core diagnostic information services business as well as disciplined capital deployment.Its several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are looking forward to the company’s recently-closed buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service, a national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services. This apart, the 2018 guidance issued promises this bullish trend to continue.Later in 2016, Quest Diagnostics provided an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholder value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.This major commercial laboratory services provider expects 3-5% revenue growth for the period from 2017 to 2020. However, the bottom-line rise is expected to better the top line at a faster rate in mid-to-high single-digit range. Per the company, its increasing partnership strength with other health care leaders is creating ample opportunities for earnings and revenue boost while simultaneously, improving the patient experience as well as reducing the overall cost of care.After enduring several quarters of dull volumes, the company has finally noticed improvement in terms of both volume and pricing. However, sustainability of this progress is still doubted. Further, reimbursement woes remain.Also, Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act. In December 2017, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association supported a lawsuit slapped on the acting secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The complaint filed against CMS (operating under the HHS purview), charged it with its failure to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

313,DGX,"Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 47 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, up 47.6% year over year. However, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.Excluding adjustments, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, reflecting a 59.4% decline from the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter net service revenues grossed $378.8 million, up 5% year over year. The top line however missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $380.62 million.Quarter in DetailWithin the company's Home Health division, net service revenues totaled $273.7 million (down 0.7%) in the second quarter. Medicare revenues of $198.3 million declined 4.8% year over year, while non-Medicare revenues improved 12.4% year over year to $75.4 million.Within the Hospice division, net service revenues grossed $90.7 million (up 19.7% year over year), including Medicare revenues of $85.8 million (up 20.3%) and non-Medicare revenues of $4.9 million (up 8.9%).Recently, the company integrated two additional operating segments within its business – Personal Care and Corporate. At Personal Care, net service revenues totaled $14.4 million, reflecting a 53.2% increase from year-ago number of $9.4 million.Corporate, on the other hand, did not register any revenue till the end of the second quarter.Amedisys Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   Amedisys Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Amedisys Inc QuoteThe company’s gross margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 41.9% in the second quarter, while gross profit rose 3.1%. Expense on salaries and benefits declined 3.1% to $74.9 million. Other expenses also dropped 8.8% to $41.6 million. Adjusted operating income of $42.5 million in the reported quarter reflects an increase of 35.8% from the year-ago adjusted operating income of $31.3 million. Operating margin expanded 250 bps to 11.2% from the year-ago figure.Amedisys exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $59.2 million, compared with $48.3 million at the end of the preceding quarter.

Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $63.3 million, compared with $26.9 million in the year-ago period.Our TakeAmedisys ended the second quarter on a dismal note, with earnings and revenues both missing estimates. At the Home Health division, the company witnessed a decline in Medicare revenues while there was an improvement in non-Medicare revenues. At Hospice, the company registered strong growth across all segments. Amedisys is currently exploring opportunities in the Home Health and Hospice segments. The company’s favorable demographic trend and strategic acquisitions encourage us as well. Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions.Meanwhile, though we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition to boost operations, escalating operating expenses and a declining gross margin continue to raise concerns. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader medical sector include PetMed Express, Inc.

314,DGX,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents by a wide margin of 22.7%. Adjusted earnings also improved a stupendous 42.1% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the second quarter came in at $186.1 million or 86 cents per share, up 46.9% or 48.3% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ second-quarter sales improved 10.9% to $841.8 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. Underlying sales increased 15.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by the other two product lines across all regions.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteSegments DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $487.5 million, reflecting 16.5% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., THVT sales in the quarter were $316.3 million, up 28.4% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance results being delivered by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $207.1 million, up 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve.Critical Care sales were $147.2 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 3.7% from second-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by double-digit growth in the company's Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the U.S and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 74.9% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves. This was however partially offset by adverse foreign exchange.SG&A expenses rose 6.6% year over year to $243.8 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment.On the other hand, R&D expenditures increased 19.5% year over year to $134.4 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs, including expenditure on clinical trials. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 160 bps to 29.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.13 billion, compared with $918.9 million at the end of the first quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.02 billion, compared with $847.9 million reported previously.Cash flow from operating activities was $197.7 million in the second quarter, compared with $128.3 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $58.0 million, free cash flow was $139.7 million. During the quarter, management repurchased 0.8 million shares for $73.8 million to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation.Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance,Edwards Lifesciences has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2–$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.35 billion, near the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $3.65–$3.85 from $3.43–$3.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.52, within the company’s guided range.For the third quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (excluding the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $810 million and $850 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $816.1 million, within the projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 80 cents and 90 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 83 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong transcatheter valve sales were a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences’ raised revenue and earnings guidance hints at better days ahead. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges to the company.Nevertheless, management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) and Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report).

316,DGX,"Anthem Inc.’s (ANTM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of $3.37 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.25 by 3.7%. The bottom line also jumped 1.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.2 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. The top line, however, grew 4.3% year over year due to premium rate increases as well as higher enrollment in the Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group insured and self-funded businesses.Medical enrollment increased 1.6% year over year to 40.4 million members. The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 6% to $21.2 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 3% rise in total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and 2.3% higher interest expenses, on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 86.1% deteriorated 190 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and less favorable adjustments to the prior-year risk adjustment estimates. However, improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses was an offset.The SG&A expense ratio of 13.8% improved 20 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, the impact of operating expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company and fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement recorded during the quarter.Segment ResultsCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $10.3 billion in the second quarter, up 4.1% year over year.Operating gain totaled $967.9 million, down 10% year over year due to less favorable adjustments to the prior-year risk adjustment estimates, the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals. The decrease was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses.Operating margin was 9.4%, down 150 bps year over year.Government BusinessOperating revenues were $11.9 billion in the second quarter, up 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.Operating gain was $293.3 million, down 35% year over year.

The reported EPS came in at $1.37, in line with the year-ago figure.Reported revenues in the second quarter inched up 1.9% year over year to $1.94 billion. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95 billion. According to the company, the year-over-year improvement came on the back of extended tie-ups with hospital health systems and strength in several of the company’s advanced diagnostic offerings.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteVolume (measured by the number of requisitions) increased 1.8% year over year in the second quarter. Also, revenue per requisition increased 0.7%.

Adjusted operating margin showed an improvement of 50 bps to 17.3%.Quest Diagnostics exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $314 million, which marked a 14.4% fall from the preceding quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, compared with $464 million in the year-ago period.In the second quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares for $150 million. As of Jun 30, 2017, Quest Diagnostics was left with $1.1 billion of authorization under the previous share repurchase plan.OutlookQuest Diagnostics raised its full-year 2017 revenue guidance.

On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment. Also, the raised guidance for adjusted earnings, revenues and net cash from operating activities buoy optimism about the company’s performance.We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its new two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services.  In addition, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks were major growth drivers. In this regard, we are looking forward to the company’s deal with Walmart. Particularly, the company is positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to bolster growth in 2017. Also, management is upbeat about its latest acquisitions of Med Fusion and ClearPoint to advance in the diagnostics space.However, over the past several quarters, the overall soft industry trends, leading to a low volume environment, acted as a dampener for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

319,DGX,"On Feb 6, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report), a major commercial laboratory services provider. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Quest Diagnostics have outperformed the broader industry over the past year. The stock has gained 8.1% against the broader industry’s 2.6% decline.We are encouraged to note that both earnings and revenues increased year over year during the recently-reported fourth quarter. Also, the company’s bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Incidentally, Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are looking forward to the company’s recently-closed buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service, a national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services. This apart, the 2018 guidance looks promising with an indication for this bullish trend to continue.Later in 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholder value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.The company expects 3-5% revenue growth for the period from 2017 to 2020. Earnings for the same time frame are expected to better revenues at a faster rate in the mid-to-high single-digit range. Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders is creating ample opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while simultaneously improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.After suffering several quarters of dull volumes, the company has finally started to see improvement in terms of both volume and pricing. However, sustainability of this progress is still doubted. Further, reimbursement woes remain.Also, Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act. In December 2017, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association came forward to support a lawsuit against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

320,DGX,"Bond yields are scaling record highs on expectations of a hike in interest rate. A two-year budget deal declared by top senators should strengthen the economy giving the Federal Reserve enough reason to raise rates. A pick-up in wages sparked fears of inflation, bolstering expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates.Lest we forget, a soft Treasury auction on Feb 7 dragged bond prices down and helped yields move up. This rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a lot of gyrations. And why not? When bond yield rises, it increases the opportunity cost of investing in other asset classes such as equities, thus, making them less attractive.Given such uncertain times, investors should select the safest of stocks, particularly those that are sound enough to withstand the intensifying volatility in the market.US Stocks Finish Lower, Bond Yields SpikeThe stock market is on a roller-coaster this week. Major bourses largely finished in the red on Feb 7 and at current levels, they stand nearly 5% below last month’s record high. The Dow shed 19.42 points to 24,893.35, while the broader S&P 500 slid 13.48 points to 2,681.66. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, in the meantime, remained at 27.73. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.While stocks struggled for direction, marked by the comeback of once-dormant volatility, treasury yields continued to scale record highs. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 7.8 basis points to 2.843% following a decline of 2.648% earlier in the week. The two-year Treasury notes rose 4.3 basis points to 2.134%, registering its largest one-day gain since Oct 16. Similarly, the 30-year rate jumped 7.5 basis points to 3.118%, its highest level since March.  What’s Driving Treasurys?Treasury yields moved north after Congressional leaders struck a two-year bipartisan budget deal, boosting expectations of a stronger economy. This in turn bolstered possibility of an imminent rate hike eventually leading to higher bond yields. In fact, record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated.Bipartisan Budget DealU.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years. They have agreed to lift caps on defense funding and some domestic government outlays. Defense budget will be raised by $160 billion, while funding for domestic programs will be hiked by $128 billion.Congress has time and again voted to raise the budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was signed in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.Why Spike in Bond Yield Halted a Market Rally?Major selling point for equities since the financial crisis has been rise in bond yields. Investors always compare yield of equities with that of fixed income. In case of equities, earnings are largely considered the yield of a share of stock. Thus, the current rise in bond yields have made these more alluring, compelling investors to pull money out of stocks.Moreover, value of future earnings goes down as interest rates go up. Higher interest rate affects almost everything from mortgages to auto loans. Purchasing a house becomes expensive and credit card bite becomes harder. All these in turn could lead to recession, ending the nine-year-old bull market.Best Screening Parameters Amid Widespread UncertaintyAs the equity market frets over rising yields, make sure you pick safe investments. In general, you should look for companies that are unperturbed by wavering market conditions. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks also have a good position in the market and pay out part of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. After all, dividend payers boast solid financial structure and are immune to market vagaries. Further, they are positioned to grow in the near term and are economically priced.5 Top Safe Stocks to BuyWe have, thus, selected five stocks flaunting the aforesaid virtues along with a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

321,DGX,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results, after markets close on Apr 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.03% with the average earnings beat being 13% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong Product revenues. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues have been gaining from rising demand for sequencing consumables and instruments as well as the microarray range.Within consumables, the NovaSeq platform continues to see growth with close to 285 NovaSeq systems currently in customers’ hands since the launch last January. For 2018, NovaSeq shipments are projected in the range of 330 to 350.Management is hopeful that launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand in the near term.Given the transition in Illumina’s high-throughput portfolio related to the NovaSeq introduction, instrument revenues have also been rising. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $621 million reflects an increase of 26.5% from the year-ago quarter.Total Services and other revenues, which include genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenues from oncology agreements, have also been strong. The upside is being driven by strength in genotyping services due to sequencing instrument maintenance contracts and increased consumer demand.At NIPT, Illumina won Dutch National contract during the previous quarter along with some other encouraging developments. Per management, these factors will more than double sales from this business in 2018.  Moreover, the company is making progress with NIPT adoption, courtesy of continued uptake of VeriSeq NIPT Solution, which includes CE-IVD marked library prep and analysis software.With MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments accounting for roughly 60% of the new-to-sequencing customer demand and growing NextSeq adoption with commercial customers using the platform in production settings, Illumina’s benchtop portfolio has been encouraging.The bullish trend is expected to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $123 million shows a rise of 15% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s first-quarter results:In January 2018, Illumina announced the launch of the iSeq 100 Sequencing System. This next-generation sequencing system delivers excellent data accuracy, at a low capital cost, making Illumina technology available to virtually any lab. Since the company began shipping the product in January itself, investors will be watching out for the difference it will make to the top-line results in the quarter to be reported.Geographically, Illumina has been witnessing growing revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) led by sequencing instruments and consumables. Solid performance in Asia Pacific propelled by 12% shipment growth in Greater China also encourages us. Recently, management has noticed an uptick in demand from customers who are attempting to set up NIPT operations in China. We believe these developments will open channels for Illumina, thereby enhancing business growth.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move may mar sales in China in the near term.Total oncology testing was up 60% in the last reported quarter. Per management, the solid results were primarily led by continued growth in the translational liquid biopsy segment. Furthermore, Illumina continues to expect robust demand for oncology testing.Overall, first-quarter total revenues are projected at $743 million, up 24.2% from the prior-year quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment.We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy. The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers.On the flip side, in the last couple of years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues hurting its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act.Notably in December, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) has come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The lawsuit charged that the CMS, operating under the purview of HHS, has failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.The company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). It is currently requesting CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act).Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

324,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) recently announced a definitive agreement to buy a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services — Mobile Medical Examination Service (MedXM). The financial terms of the deal, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, have been kept under wraps.Based in Santa Ana, CA, MedXM has an extensive national network of more than 1,700 medical professionals. It provides enhanced member satisfaction for health plans, particularly Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid, and also enriched quality of care. Thus, the acquisition will strengthen Quest Diagnostics’ position in extended care and widen its scale and reach in the mobile/home segment as well.Going by data published in a report by Grand View Research, the deals seems to be lucrative as well as strategic. Per the report, the global home healthcare market is likely to see a CAGR of 7.8% between 2014 and 2025. Growth will mainly be driven by factors such as rising old-age demography across the globe, growing need of cost-effective healthcare, rising incidences of chronic diseases and technological advancements in devices.We are also optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services. Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers in the past. In this regard, we are encouraged by the company’s completion of thebuyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals — The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. The company has also completed the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise. Moreover, the company’s agreement to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and plans to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare buoy optimism.We are also upbeat about Quest Diagnostics and Clinical Genomics, a major player in the field of colorectal cancer detection, jointly announced FDA clearance of the latter’s InSure ONE. Notably, with the FDA approval, Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians, organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States. InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018. This development is in line with Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to grow in cancer diagnostics.The company’s relationship with PeaceHealth has also been fortified. The partnership entails the acquisition of an outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of the M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnostics’ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through accretive acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition in diagnostic testing laboratory space, primarily from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) and other commercial laboratories and hospitals.  Moreover, in the clinical laboratory market some of the major players are Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

QuoteQuarter DetailsAcadia Healthcare’s revenues for the third quarter declined 2.4% to $716.7 million from the prior-year quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. The decline could be attributed to higher provision for doubtful accounts.Same facility revenues increased 5.5%, with a 3.5% increase in patient days and a 1.9% increase in revenue per patient day.The same facility revenue growth can be attributed to the addition of more than 600 new beds to existing facilities in the 12 months ended Sep 30, 2017. To existing facilities, 179 new beds were added. The company anticipates to add 800 new beds to existing facilities and de novo facilities in 2017.U.S. same facility revenues were up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.

326,DGX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is pegged at -0.03%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWithin structural heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE, and IRIS product lines, expected to strongly contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Earlier, the company stated that in2018, it expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to gross approximately $400 million.We are optimistic about the gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, the company has of late, successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) products.The WATCHMAN platform is anticipated to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.This apart, new launches within IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO, are likely to strongly contribute to the top line in the upcoming quarter.We are also upbeat about the company’s ACURATE (TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) program, which has recently completed training of European sales and clinical teams.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of the company’s earnings release for the first quarter, we believe its IC business to be once again deeply impacted by the product recall issue within Europe. Notably, the company has recently announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall, last February.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.However, the company is expected to face some downsides within this business too in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. These headwinds may come in the form of year-over-year difficult pacer comparisons and more competitions in the drug eluting stent space with some new entrants.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $420 million, 8.5% above the prior-year quarter’s reported count of $387 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the consensus mark of $289 million remains 9.1% ahead of the year-earlier quarter’s reported tally of $265 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific have been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from the international markets, it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations. This apart, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States as well as China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the future.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Together, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.34% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.19% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

327,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc.'s (DGX  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9% and the year-ago number by 1.5%.Adjusted EPS in the reported quarter excluded charges related to restructuring and integration, retirement of debt, gain on disposition of business as well as amortization expenses. The reported EPS came in at $1.15, a 14.2% slip from the year-ago quarter figure.Reported revenues in the third quarter inched up 2.4% year over year to $1.93 billion. The quarter’s number however remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. According to the company, in spite of weather challenges, the year-over-year improvement came on the back of successful execution of its two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Volume (measured by the number of requisitions) increased 1.6% year over year in the third quarter. Also, revenue per requisition increased 1.2%. Diagnostic information services revenues in the quarter rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.85 billion.Cost of services during the reported quarter was $1.19 billion, up 2.9% year over year. Gross margin came in at 38.4%, reflecting a 25 basis points (bps) contraction year over year.Among the operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.4% to $423 million in the reported quarter. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin showed an contraction of 45 bps to 16.5%.Quest Diagnostics exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $350 million, which marked an 11.5% rise from the preceding quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $852 million, compared with $765 million in the year-ago period.In the third quarter, the company repurchased 0.6 million shares for $65 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Quest Diagnostics was left with $1 billion of authorization under the previous share repurchase plan.OutlookConsidering the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, especially on the company's operations in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, as well as recently closed acquisitions, Quest Diagnostics has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company now expects full-year reported revenues of approximately $7.71 billion (annualized growth of approximately 3%) as compared to the earlier stated range of $7.69 billion to $7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6–3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, lower than the company’s projected number.In addition, the upper-end of the company’s earlier-provided 2017 adjusted EPS range has been reduced. Currently Quest Diagnostics expects earnings for the full year to remain in the band of $5.62–$5.67 from earlier forecast of $5.62–$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.63 falls within but near to the lower-end of the projected band.Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected at around $1.2 billion, unchanged from the previous guidance. The current estimates for capital expenditure are pegged at $250–$300 million (unchanged).Our TakeQuest Diagnostics’ third-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues remained in line with the same. On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment. We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are currently looking forward to the company’s recently-announced strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic which includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab.On the flip side, Quest Diagnostics faced major sales disruption due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, where the company has a significant presence. Also hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the earthquake in Mexico affected Quest Diagnostics’ overall performance in the reported quarter. With this the company has to reduce the upper-end of its earlier provided full-year earnings guidance range, which is disappointing.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). It is currently requesting CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act).Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We have highlighted some of the key details from the just-released announcement below:Earnings: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is $1.35 per share, over the last 30 days. Quest Diagnostics’ third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share (up 1.5% year-over-year) has surpassed this estimate by 2.9%.Revenues: Quest Diagnostics posted revenues of $1.93 billion in the reported quarter, up 2.4% year-over-year and at par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues.Key Stats: Quest Diagnostics’ volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.6% versus the prior year’s volume. However, revenue per requisition also increased 1.2% on a year-over-year basis.Major Factors: The company delivered solid growth in the third quarter with gains in revenues and earnings per share despite severe weather challenges. Quest Diagnostics is successfully executing its two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.

329,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 9.9%. Also, Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAfter several quarters of sustained drag in the company’s revenue per requisition performance,last quarter saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this improvement is here to stay or not. The company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Overall, we believe that a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously impact the company’s volume (measured by the number of requisitions) environment till the economy turns around for better.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis apart, unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the previously reported second quarter. While unit price headwinds hovered in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too.Also, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics has faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe, reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company’s performance this soon-to-be-reported quarter too.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this leaves no impact on its yet-to-be-reported quarter’s revenue numbers.On a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to repeat its well-meaning efforts from second-quarter 2017 by stimulating the company’s performance via a two-point growth strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to grow esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the third quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues in the range of $7.69-$7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6-3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.7 billion, just above the lower-end of the guided range.In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains at $5.62-$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of -2.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Combined with a negative ESP, Quest Diagnostics’ chances of an earnings beat can not be conclusively predicted.We caution against the stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows them to comprise the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #2.

330,DGX,"Quest Diagnostics(DGX  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of the buyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals — The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. However, the financial terms of the transaction have been kept under wraps.Now on, the laboratory operations of the hospitals will be shifted to Quest Diagnostics’ advanced full-service clinical laboratory in Marlborough, MA, along with rapid response laboratories in Wallingford, Torrington, Stratford, Hartford and Norwich based in Connecticut. The buyouts, which have been approved by the state of Connecticut's Office of Health Care Access, will give care providers direct access to Quest Diagnostics’ broader menu of services along with a wider network of patient service centers.Per the company, this deal will strengthen its business relationship with Hartford HealthCare. In this context, Quest Diagnostics had acquired the outreach laboratory service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, in 2016.  We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services. Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers. In this regard, we are looking forward to the company’s deal with Walmart. Particularly, the company is positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to bolster growth in 2017. Also, management is upbeat about the latest acquisitions of Med Fusion and ClearPoint to advance in the diagnostics space. We are also encouraged by the company’s plan to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of M&A guidelines.

331,DGX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Quest Diagnostics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Quest Diagnostics’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having fallen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Quest Diagnostics has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 22.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Quest Diagnostics stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Quest Diagnostics has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DGX is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Quest Diagnostics currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Quest Diagnostics a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Quest Diagnostics might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives DGX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen thirteen up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and Consensus  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and Consensus | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineQuest Diagnostics is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 22% of more than 250 industries) instills investor confidence. However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the markets, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

332,DGX,"On an inorganic expansion spree, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has recently entered into yet another acquisition agreement. The company has decided to purchase Fresenius Medical Care’s medical laboratory business, Shiel.Although financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, Quest Diagnostics expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals.Notably, Shiel is a clinical laboratory provider of Fresenius Medical Care, a premier healthcare company particularly working on renal and other chronic conditions in patients.

335,DGX,"On Sep 4, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report), a major commercial laboratory services provider. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, Quest Diagnostics has been trading above the broader industry. As per the last share price movement, the stock has gained 9.9% in contrast to the 5.5% decline of the broader industry over the same time frame.The company’s earnings in the last reported second quarter exceeded estimates, while revenues lagged the same. The company has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment. Finally, the raised 2017 guidance indicates chances of continuation of this bullish trend. In addition, alliance with hospitals and integrated delivery networks are other growth drivers. The company is particularly positive about its PeaceHealth acquisition in the Pacific Northwest which is expected to bolster growth in the rest of 2017.We are also encouraged by the launch of QHerit by Quest Diagnostics in July. The QHerit Pan-Ethnic Expanded Carrier Screen is a panel of tests for the 22 heritable diseases mentioned under new screening guidelines issued in March 2017 by the American College of Gynecology (ACOG). Further, the company has completed its previously announced acquisition of laboratory businesses — Med Fusion and Clear Point.In late 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholders’ value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.However, we are concerned about the tough organic volume scenario. Also, in the last three months, a comparative study of Quest Diagnostic’s forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflects that the stock is quite overvalued. A tough competitive landscape and reimbursement headwinds are other concerns.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.
