0,AEP,"Dividend funds have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years after outperforming through the first seven years of the 10. They outperformed the more growth-oriented big-cap benchmark during the early part of the decade because they suffered smaller price setbacks during the years of the financial crisis, 2007-09. Then, during the bull market that began in early 2009,…
"
1,AEP,"It's been a rough start for the stock market in 2016, so it's not surprising to see defensive areas of the market like utilities and real estate investment trusts setting up for possible upside moves.Both groups are known for delivering solid yields, and with growth stocks generally out of favor for now, institutional money has been quietly flowing into each group.Bullish setups abound in the utility group from the likes of American Electric Power (AEP), Scana (SCG) and WEC Energy (WEC).But the REIT group is home to compelling setups as well. Digital Realty (DLR) has emerged as the leader in the REIT group and already has cleared a buy point, but plenty of other names are attracting interest.Institutional investors were accumulating shares of DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) late last year as it worked on the right side of a cup-shaped base. A handle area has been forming that shows a 33.72 buy point.Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the company operates 12 multi-tenant wholesale data centers in four major markets. Data centers remain in high demand as companies like Internet content providers, health care and financial firms outsource their data-management needs. Annual pretax margin (29.8%) and return on equity (8.9%) at DuPont hit multiyear highs in 2014. It currently yields around 6%.Elsewhere in the group, Realty Income (O) is holding its own as it sits just above a 52.70 buy point. Its specialty is triple-net leases, in which the tenant is responsible for paying a building's property taxes, building insurance and maintenance costs. Realty Income currently yields 4.4%.Finally, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) is trading tightly and still in a buy range from a 145.68 entry. The company operates retail and mixed-used properties in the Northwest, Mid-Atlantic and California.

2,AEP,"Investors threw utility stocks out the window Friday. The Labor Department's eye-popping employment report seemed to seal the deal that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon.

3,AEP,"The CME FedWatch tool registered a 70% chance the Fed will raise rates at its Dec. 16 meeting. The odds are calculated from action in the fed funds futures markets.

4,AEP,"The government reported that 271,000 jobs were created in October, well above the 185,000 that economists forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 5% from 5.1% in September, the lowest in 7-1/2 years.

5,AEP,"The SPDR Utilities (XLU) ETF gapped down and dropped nearly 4%.

6,AEP,"Southern (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED,), American Electric Power (AEP) and Great Plains Energy (GXP) were all among stocks that suffered stiff declines. Utility stocks don't do well in an environment of rising interest rates for a couple of reasons.

7,AEP,"Utilities tend to have heavy debt loads to upgrade and maintain their facilities. Rising rates make that more expensive.

8,AEP,"Also, dividend-paying utilities compete with interest-bearing securities, such as bonds, for investors' affections.

9,AEP,"As interest rates rise, dividend-paying stocks become less attractive.

10,AEP,"The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has been rising for several weeks and jumped sharply on Friday.

14,AEP,"Little Lies.....Fleetwood Mac - Tango in the Night - 1987 ""If I could turn the page, In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two, I couldn't find a way, So I'll settle for one day to believe in you........Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies...Oh no, no, you can't disguise....""
"
15,AEP,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
16,AEP,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
17,AEP,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
18,AEP,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
19,AEP,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
20,AEP,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
21,AEP,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
22,AEP,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
23,AEP,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......
"
24,AEP,"More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....
"
25,AEP,"European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
26,AEP,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

31,AEP,"So by the sounds of it, so many expected yesterday to be the day it all would change! A number of high profile 'tech' names reported earnings and the results were 'less than stellar' - not horrible, but just a bit disappointing......Commodities continued to weaken.........The chatter was all doom and gloom, THIS was going to be the catalyst for the market to correct. OMG! What would this all say about China? It's as if the whole world is dependent upon this one country.....It's the herd mentality playing out.....

Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities. And by the way - weaker oil and food prices NEVER hurt anybody....

You wouldn't - but at a discount you might....and if you are a seller you get more anxious as the buyers pull back.....and there it goes - that vicious circle.........But at some point investors realize that the global economy is doing just fine - and the action is not because of a global slowdown.....and then the markets re-adjust.....

Heating-related usage rises, but outages create restoration costs.On balance, however, weather was a winner for AEP in Q1, and other positives lined up.Earnings rose 44% in the first quarter, which represented acceleration from Q4's 20% gain and Q3's 8% pop. Revenue stepped up from flat in Q3 to 4% and 21% in the following quarters.The 21% revenue pop was the best in at least 19 quarters.After-tax margin was 12% vs. 10.1% in the year-ago quarter. Pretax margin in 2013 was 15.5%, the highest in at least nine years.In its Form 10-Q report, the company attributed the improvements to successful rate proceedings, weather-related usage increases and higher market prices.The good results had to overcome lost sales because of the closure of the Ormet aluminum smelter in Hannibal, Ohio. AEP's industrial sales fell 2.9% in Q1. Apart from Ormet, sales rose 2.2%.Ormet's impact, though, is short-term. Power sales to Ormet will now be diverted to wholesale markets, which generally have higher prices.American Electric Power pays a quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share. The annualized yield is 3.8%. While the dividend is up from 35 cents a share in 2005, several years involved no increase. In 2003, the dividend was slashed from 60 cents a share when wholesale electricity prices collapsed.The stock recently cleared a 50.99 buy point in a flat base. Shares remain in a buy zone despite a low-volume breakout.

50,AEP,"Electrical utilities have powered ahead more than 16% since the start of the year. The gain easily tops the S&P 500's 7% advance. It was also the group's best performance — by far — in at least 10 years.
"
51,AEP,"Consolidation and rationalization of industry capacity helped drive the stock price gains. Pepco Holdings (POM) led the advance, surging 31% in April after Chicago-based Exelon (EXC) agreed to buy the company for $6.9 billion. That brought the total for utility industry acquisitions over the past year to $14.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
"
52,AEP,"The prevailing pressure on the industry has been the federal initiative increasing regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants. As a result, older, lower-efficiency power plants have been shut down across much of the industry. In addition, strong supply and soft prices for natural gas have made gas-fired generators much more profitable. The combined result has been a vast reshuffling of the configuration and ownership of the U.S. power generation fleet.
"
53,AEP,"American Electric Power (AEP) is widely considered to have the largest coal-fired armada among power producers. The Columbus, Ohio-based operation has increased its capital spending program to $11.5 billion through 2016, working to place more emphasis on transmission facilities and on the regulated side of its business. The goal: more stable pricing and revenue growth.

58,AEP,"American Electric Power (AEP) can make a claim few companies can: It has paid a dividend for more than 400 straight quarters.That's more than a century of dividends. They've been rising in the past few years, but haven't been going straight up.Columbus, Ohio-based AEP sells electricity in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.It sells both retail and wholesale power, has 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity and more than 40,000 miles of transmission lines. It produces power using coal and lignite, natural gas, and nuclear and hydroelectric power.AEP was founded in 1906 as the American Gas and Electric Co., bringing together the utilities of a hodgepodge of small towns stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to Illinois. Over the years, it has bought and sold a number of operations.When the federal government broke up the public utility holding companies in 1935, AEP was forced to sell parts of its operation, but kept its core holdings.AEP paid out 60 cents a share in quarterly dividends in 2003, but dropped it to 35 cents in 2004. It's been rising since then, but has not yet gotten back to its previous level.Dividends have just hit 50 cents a share, which works out to a 4% annual yield. The company has a five-year dividend growth rate of 4%, not particularly impressive compared to some other utility stocks.It had three straight years of earnings decline from 2002 to 2004, where earnings dropped 15%, 12% and 8%. Since then, it has only had one significant down year, 2009, when earnings fell 7%. Since then, earnings have been growing, at best, in the low single digits. EPS shrank fractionally in 2012.It has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 on a 0 to 99 scale, where low numbers equate to steady earnings growth.It's been reducing its debt-to-equity ratio from 114% three years ago to 103% two years ago to 102% last year.

61,AEP,"Electricity consumption tied to Bitcoin and other digital currencies on computer networks could give a boost to some U.S. utilities and create partnership opportunities for renewable energy developers, says a Morgan Stanley report.""Though the overall impact from increased demand seems minimal at this time, the key utility beneficiaries we would highlight include: American Electric Power (AEP), Xcel Energy (XEL), and Entergy (ETR),"" Nicholas Ashworth, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a report to clients published Wednesday. ""These utilities serve the regions with the lowest cost of electricity, and American Electric Power and Xcel are taking advantage of low-cost wind (power) to drive rates even lower.""""There is also the potential for wind and solar developers, we would highlight NextEra Energy (NEE) and Pattern Energy (PEGI), to get involved in supplying 'firm' renewable power solutions to concentrated mining operations,"" Ashworth added.Digital currency transactions require energy-intensive computer networks. A public ledger, called a blockchain, provides a record of where every digital token was first ""mined"" using computing power. For Bitcoin, verifying a transaction and adding it to the blockchain earns a miner a specific number of bitcoins.By design, Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive — in terms of computing power and electricity — to add new blocks. Cryptocurrency power use is facing more scrutiny, particularly in China, where officials are concerned miners are taking advantage of low electricity prices.Some parts of the U.S. — such as the Midwest and Northwest — could also offer mining networks low power costs, Ashworth said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.""Electricity consumption from Bitcoin in 2018 could be as great as we forecast for global electric vehicles in 2025,"" Morgan Stanley added.""However in theory Bitcoin's energy usage should decline in the long run. The network is designed to produce one block every ten minutes, regardless of energy use. The Bitcoin reward for mining a block however halves every four years — the next time is in 2020. If it becomes unprofitable to mine, then in theory less mining will occur.""RELATED:Is Resistance In These 2 Stocks A Warning For Chip-Sector Investors?Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetJust How Many More 'Blockchain Pretenders' Could 2018 Bring?Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

92,AEP,"The third-quarter earnings season is fast approaching its peak. As of Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. By end of Oct 27, nearly 267 members of the index are expected to release their numbers.Total earnings for these 87 S&P 500 members are up 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating earnings per share estimates and 70.1% surpassing revenue estimates.Amid this positive performance so far let us focus on the Zacks Utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 4% this season. Notably, at present, nine out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve raised the rates twice in this year — in March and June. This will definitely hurt the sector’s stocks. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.Let us take a sneak peek at few utility stocks that are scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct 26.NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share, reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.NextEra Energy’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

Last quarter, this electric utility witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 8.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric is highly dependent on coal for production of electricity. Therefore, President Trump’s emphasis on improving the coal industry and relaxing the stringent environmental regulations in recent times are likely to boost the company’s prospects in the near term..Also, American Electric is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Markedly, Ohio and Texas represents more than one-half of utility revenues of the company. However, the power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment.

95,AEP,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Penn Power recently announced that it is currently concluding work on power line and substation projects worth $15 million to reduce the number and duration of power outages in the company's service area.The projects are part of Penn Power's 2016-2020 Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP) approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Notably, the company expects to invest $62 million through 2020 under this project, with an aim to improve infrastructure and distribution lines across the service area.Details of the LTIIP ProjectsNotably, LTIIP projects will involve building new substations as well as distribution lines near Jackson Center and New Castle, with investments worth $3.1 million and $2.6 million respectively. Another line will be constructed between Pymatuning Central and Jamestown for an investment worth $1.2 million. Once the substations are connected, these are anticipated to ensure redundancy across Penn Power’s service area along with providing additional options for routing power on the local system. It will also reduce the frequency and length of power outages.Additionally, an investment of $0.6 million is anticipated toward replacement of an underground conductor in Sewickley, to improve system reliability. Remote-controlled switches worth $0.5 million will be installed to enable faster power restoration.Our ViewPenn Power currently serves approximately 160,000 customers across its service area. As witnessed previously, FirstEnergy has been active in pursuing its “Energizing the Future” plan through subsidiaries. This plan was initiated to primarily upgrade and expand the company’s regulated transmission capabilities across its area of operations. Under the initiative, the company has mapped out plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2 to $5.8 billion over the 2017–2021 time period.Recently, the company’s Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) unit announced the completion of project equipment upgradation worth $3 million at a substation in Reading, PA.

Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure base is of utmost importance to ensure steady and uninterrupted supply of electricity and power for the customers. Consequently, other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also currently undertaking steps to strengthen their existing infrastructure while replacing older ones.

96,AEP,"With the Q3 earnings season kicking off, Utility companies are preparing to release their numbers in the next couple of weeks. Notably, the Zacks Utility sector gained 3% in the third quarter.Factors Boosting the UtilitiesA major factor which boosts the utility sector is that there exists no substitute for the energy-related services rendered by the utilities. The endless demand for electricity and utility services will never cease to exist, thereby conferring a consistent flow of revenue to these companies. Thus utilities are considered as a safe haven.Utilities generate more or less stable earnings unless any sudden event impacts their operations adversely. This regulated nature of operations provide them stability and in turn they reward their shareholders with steady dividend rates.Moreover, the predominant domestic focus shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues. Also the major utility providers make frequent modernizations of their grid system and distribution networks to offer seamless flow of electricity to customers. In fact, it is these modernization initiatives that saved the grid systems from getting severely damaged from the widespread hurricane rampage that hit the coastal U.S. in the last couple of months.Further, stringent emission regulations implemented by Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although it is a favorable development from the environmental point of view, utilities had to make huge investments to ease the transition to renewables.However, President Trump’s recent initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan on economic growth grounds is expected to give a temporary breather to utilities that produce major part of their electricity from coal.On the other hand, realizing the need for clean energy a number of major utility providers like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) have already taken initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources. Considering the fact that renewable energy is the ultimate future of energy resources, these initiatives will boost the growth of alternative-energy utilities, in the long run.We believe, over time, a constructive utility-rate environment and increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewable sources will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.Earnings Expectations for UtilitiesPer our Earnings Trend, as of Oct 11, Q3 earnings for the Utility sector is expected to be down 2.9%, while sales for the same is estimated to be up by 1.5%. Operations of major utilities like NextEra, Duke Energy and American Electric Power Corporation (AEP  -  Free Report) that have extensive business in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida were affected adversely. Although a minor section of their grid system got damaged severely, they were compelled to stall electricity distribution. These outages are expected to weigh on their Q3 earnings, which in turn may have dragged down this sector’s overall earnings expectation for the quarter.Nevertheless, going ahead, in 2017, this sector is expected to exhibit an earnings improvement of 2.1% and sales growth of 4.4%. This indicates an improvement in the results of these stocks ahead of Q3.How to Identify Potential Winners Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Moreover, investors constantly seek stocks that not only maintain stability but produce respectable returns for shareholders.

97,AEP,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) announced that it has successfully completed the upgradation of project equipment worth $3 million at a substation in Reading, PA. The equipment upgrade will enable the company to efficiently meet the increasing electrical demands of 2,500 customers in the Glenside area of the city going forward.Details of UpgradesPer the details, the upgradation primarily included the replacement of an old transformer and other equipment built back in 1940. The project upgradation was designed keeping in view the local electric system's capacity without expanding the substation's area or constructing additional power lines.Additionally, novel circuit breakers and relay devices that have been introduced following the revamp will protect equipment by interrupting the flow of electricity against tree-related outages and lightning strikes. Going ahead, the company's dispatchers will monitor conditions at the substation closely to help reduce the duration of outages, a feature that was absent during the time the substation was originally built.Other ProjectsFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has been boosting the company’s service reliability and leading to higher customer retention. To improve the service reliability for its customers in the Penelec and Met-Ed service territories, the company has planned to invest nearly $600 million in transmission projects through 2018.

The aforementioned upgradation project is a testament of the company’s focus to meet the growing electrical demands in the Glenside area of Reading.We believe that FirstEnergy’s step toward enhancing service reliability through electrical upgradation and renewing work will aid the company to position itself as a competitive utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth. Toward this, we anticipate the company and its subsidiaries alike to deliver safe and reliable electric services along with meeting the growing electrical needs of customers over the times to come.Utility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc.

100,AEP,"In one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years -- Hurricane Harvey -- the city of Houston was the worst hit. The storm ravaged through the city causing widespread damage to properties as well as human lives. Catastrophic flooding further added to the woes.Among the 16 sectors in our Zacks Coverage Universe, Energy and Insurance sectors have lost the most. In addition, Utility sector also suffered since catastrophic flooding affected transmission lines in many regions of the state, forcing thousands to deal with power cuts.Harvey’s Effect in TexasAccording to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the impact of Harvey was far greater than that of Hurricane Katrina, which affected New Orleans in 2005.The U.S. government requested Congress for an aid of $7.85 billion for rescue operations in Texas and Louisiana. However, Governor Abbott, in his latest interview to BBC News, claimed that Texas will need an assistance of $180 billion to recuperate from the loss. Notably this is higher than his earlier provided estimate of $125 billion worth aid.Harvey’s Impact on UtilitiesPer the latest report provided by the Electric Reliablity Council of Texas (ERCOT), as of Sep 1, certain areas in the state of Texas will continue to experience outages due to Harvey. This is because two major 345-kV transmission lines in the state are still out of service, including the one in Houston.Moreover, about 7,500 MW of generation resource capacity remains unavailable or is operating at reduced capacity.According to ERCOT’s report, none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to advanced infrastructural development. However, most of their customers suffered significant power outages, which in turn may impact their third-quarter bottom-line results.Although, utility providers are trying their best to restore the system, it is difficult to exactly forecast the time of full restoration as it depends on the extent of damage and location of the outage. Moreover, continued flooding is likely to delay restoration in many areas and lead to new outages.Naturally, electricty flow from utility providers that operate in Texas suffered extensively due to this category 4 hurricane, which had earlier been predicted to be a category 3 storm.Utilities Hit by HarveyConsidering the fact that Houston is the fourth most populous city of the United States, demand for electricity is also high. Coming to the state’s statistics, Texas is the second-largest economy among the U.S. states and is the largest electricity consumer, as per latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This made the state a well desired abode for utility players to expand their business.However, Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages and are expected to affect the growth of the following three utilities.American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report): AEP Texas, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers in west, central and southern Texas. It encompasses the AEP service territory in the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 0.8%, following the impact of Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report): Houston Electric, a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy,engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area including the city of Houston. It is also a member of the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 1% due to Harvey’s impact. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report): Entergy Texas, a subsidiary of Entergy Corp., engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas.The company’s shares have declined 1% owing to Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Bottom LineHarvey not only destroyed properties in Texas but also left an indelible mark on the lives of many. However, no one can deny the fact that the enormous investments which Utilities have been making in infrastructural developments to upgrade their transmission lines and grid system have paid well during this period of crisis. Thus it can be said that though Harvey had been one of the worst storms to affect America in the recent past, the damages that occurred to the grids and transmission lines were not equally extensive.However, owing to safety issues distributors snapped electricity in flooded areas resulting in prolonged outages. Though the operating profits of the utility providers are likely to be impacted by the move, the extent of the same would have been much higher had the grid system been affected. Nevertheless, with Hurricane Irma knocking on the doors, utility providers may need to brace themselves from yet another tropical storm and its aftermath.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

111,AEP,"The coal industry is faced with numerous challenges from domestic and international markets. In the U.S., strong competition from natural gas, stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from the commodity.Moreover, coal-producing countries like Australia and Indonesia — along with, importantly, a stronger greenback — are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.Also, in line with the policy laid down by the Paris Agreement, leading energy companies operating in Europe have announced that they will not invest in any new coal fired power plants post 2020. This will certainly dampen the prospects of coal in European countries.Even without the Clean Power Plan, utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE), Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) were already investing hugely to create a green energy generation portfolio and have enhanced their focus on electricity from clean fuel sources.The Clean Power Plan has been repealed by President Trump. Despite that, new investments are being directed toward natural gas and renewable-based power production due to the clean-burning nature of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more solar and wind power.Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables. U.S. coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016, at 739 million short tons (MMst) since 1978.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against:Natural Gas Substituting Coal: A major substitute for coal in energy generation is natural gas, another fossil fuel. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production, and a shale gas boom in onshore United States, is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.A recent U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) release projected that coal production in the United States will drop 3% year over year to 751 million short tons (MMst). The decline is attributable to a 4% drop in domestic consumption of coal and an expected 9% drop in coal exports. Coal production is expected to remain flat in 2019.The EIA release showed that natural gas contributed 32% to total energy generation in 2017. Its share is expected to go up to 33% in 2018 and further increase 100 basis points to 34% in 2019. On the other hand, the share of coal is expected to drop from 30% in 2017 to 28% in 2019.In addition to power generation, natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors.Environmental Legislation: Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry. Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone? The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry’s prospects.Duke Energy will invest $11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30% since 2005.American Electric Power Company (AEP  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has announced its plan to add 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in its portfolio by 2030 and lower its emission levels by 60% from 2000 levels by 2030. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Majority of the power plants retired over the last decade in the United States were based on fossil fuels and among them a major chunk used coal to produce electricity. So, the ongoing reduction in usage of coal will hurt its long-term prospects.Competition from Alternative Energy Sources: Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy. Usage of alternate energy is on the rise, with more utility-scale solar projects being commissioned across the country.The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising. Per the report, the 2014 to 2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. Out of the 32 GW new plants planned to be added in 2018, nearly 36% will come from renewable sources. The rising popularity of the alternate energy source is undeniable and may hurt the prospects of coal.Rising Competition: Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia. International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs, consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers. Per the EIA release, coal exports – that touched 97.0 million tons in 2017 – will drop to 88.1 million tons in 2018 and further decline to 84.6 million tons in 2019.Bankers Retreat: Capital-intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions. Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas-based power projects.To ConcludeEven though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry, it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused. Over the past year, new jobs were added in the coal industry, but questions remain on the sustainability of this revision over the long run.To overcome difficulties and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines. Despite these initiatives, coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down-cycle, as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term.Billions of dollars have already been invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals, so at this juncture going backward to dirty coal might not be a smart choice for our planet. Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet, according to a vast majority of climate scientists.

119,AEP,"American Electric Power Co., Inc.’s (AEP  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Southwestern Electric Power Co. (SWEPCO), recently announced that it has received the regulatory sanction from Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) to proceed with the Wind Catcher project. Notably the project involves a significant investment worth $4.5 billion.On completion, this project is likely to further expand the company’s renewable generation portfolio that comprised contracted projects worth 400 megawatts (MW) as of Mar 31, 2018. However, it remains subject to the approval of state commissions in Texas and Oklahoma.Details of the DealThe Wind Catcher project involves the acquisition of a 2,000 MW wind generation facility by American Electric. Currently, it is under constructionat Oklahoma Panhandle.The project also covers construction of an approximately 350-mile dedicated power line that will carry the wind energy to the Tulsa area, which will then be delivered through the company’s existing grid.  While, SWEPCO will own 70% of the project, another subsidiary of American Electric — Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) — will own 30% of the same. SWEPCO and PSO will purchase the facility once construction is over, in the fourth quarter of 2020.Benefits of the ProjectPer SWEPCO, the project will save its customers more than $4 billion over the 25-year life of the wind farm compared with the projected costs of buying power in the open market.Therefore, customers of American Electric should realize savings in their bills, primarily through a reduction in the fuel portion of bills, beginning in 2021.The 800 wind turbines to be installed in the farm will supplied by GE Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, GE Renewable Energy and manufactured in Louisiana. Thus, the construction of the Wind Catcher project will increase the manufacturing activity in Louisiana, thereby boosting the state’s economic growth.Why Wind Energy?A report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) shows that wind power generation will surpass hydroelectricity in the United States, in 2018. To this end, the EIA expects wind capacity to increase by 8.3 GW in 2018 and 8 GW in 2019.According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017,the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component that makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. Markedly, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half since 2010.This, in turn, has made the construction of wind power projects cheaper, thereby setting the stage for utility providers like American Electric to make valuable investments in wind projects like the Wind Catcher farm.Moreover, being the largest single-site wind project in the United States, Wind Catcher will surely offer American Electric a competitive advantage over other utility providers that are also trying to reap benefits of the expanding wind energy market.Other Utilities Following SuitAccording to the Renewable Energy: United States report, demand for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2% by 2021. This has prompted other utility providers to make notable investments in wind energy for expanding their clean energy portfolio. For instance, NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.With the Global Wind Energy Outlook expecting wind power to supply up to 12% of global electricity by 2020 (as per the Global Wind Energy Council) and the United States being one of the largest global wind markets, we may expect to witness more such wind project developments in the nation.Zacks Rank & Price MovementAmerican Electric currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In a year’s time, shares of American Electric have lost 8.5% compared with its industry’s decline of 6.2%.The underperformance may have been caused due to expenditures incurred by the company for meeting proposed environmental regulations.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

120,AEP,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Constellation, along with United Renewable Energy LLC have completed a 1.8 megawatt (MW) solar generation project located at Hunter Farms, in Jakin, GA.This solar project will consist of 5,305 photovoltaic panels fitted in a tracking solar array and operate under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with Constellation selling all energy and environmental attributes to Georgia Power.Constellation is focused on expanding its renewable energy generation in Georgia. It presently owns and operates nearly 17.8 MW solar projects in Georgia. Last year, the company along with United Renewable Energy completed a 1 MW solar project in Georgia, and its entire production had been sold to Georgia Power under a 30-year PPA.Rising Importance of RenewablesDespite efforts from the new administration to safeguard interest of the coal-fired unit, it is quite clear that demand for coal as an energy source is on the decline, and the void will be filled up by natural gas and renewable sources.The latest report from U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) indicates that energy consumption from renewable sources will increase 3.8% to 11.431 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 2.9% to 11.766 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Per the EIA report, production from solar power will also increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019.Focus on Storage FacilitiesUtility space in the United States is evolving and its emphasis on renewable generation is quite evident. Since the renewable sources like solar and wind were not able to produce electricity 24x7 like the conventional fossil or nuclear power plants, it has become essential to develop battery storage facilities.Battery storage facilities store power produced from renewable sources and supply them to the grid when there is high demand. Battery storage will increase reliability of the entire power distribution operation and lower dependence on fossil-fuel generation.Exelon has also invested in the new energy storage technology through Volta Energy Technologies. In addition, other large utilities like American Electric Power (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have also invested to develop energy storage facilities.Per an EIA release, the United States had 742 MWh of energy in operational large-scale battery capacity at the end of 2017.  Given the increasing production from renewables and decreasing cost to install storage facilities, we expect more such facilities to come up in the United States.  Price MovementIn a year’s time, Exelon has returned 10.8% against its industry’s decline of 9.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

126,AEP,"The Q1 earnings season is set to cross its half way mark by the end of this week. So far, earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are above historical levels.Total earnings for the 87 S&P members that have released results as of Apr 20, improved 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82.8%, while that for the top line was 67.8%.Notably, we expect total Q1 earnings for the index members to rise 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let’s see how the Zacks Utilities sector is poised for this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 12.4% in the first quarter. (For more details check out our latest Earnings Preview)A Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018. Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns. Currently, the sector is undergoing a transition, wherein the primary fuel source — coal — is being replaced by natural gas and renewables.However, utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are undertaking cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter.The quarter was also a witness to a colder-than-normal winter in most parts of the United States. Utilities are likely to benefit from this as it will drive heating expenditures for households, boosting the companies’ earnings.However, earnings projections for the sector hint at an unimpressive quarter, when compared to its Q4 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 12% on in-line year-over-year revenues. In the fourth quarter, earnings for this sector increased 13.3% on 4.2% sales growth.Utilities to Post Q1 Earnings on Apr 26American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.94% in the last quarter. However, the company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.25%.The company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Expecting this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion shows an annual decline of 4.9%.However, lower tax rates, courtesy of the latest tax reform, is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). American Electric does not possess this combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%.

Last quarter, this electric utility reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric filed several rate cases in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas in 2017, outcomes from which are expected by management in first half of 2018. Thus, we believe that the upcoming results are likely to be impacted by the developments of these rate cases.GDP growth in the company’s service territory exceeded that of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, courtesy of higher energy prices and the strong global economy. Moreover, rise in employment in its service territory hints at improved purchasing power and thus a notable residential sales growth for American Electric is expected in the near term.However, the company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Considering this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion, reflects an annual decline of 4.9%.On the other hand, lower tax rates courtesy of the latest tax reform is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings reflects 4.2% improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for American Electric this quarter.

137,AEP,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries recently completed inspection operations and maintenance services of its equipments, in a bid to ensure operational reliability in its service territory, before winter arrives next month in the United States.Currently the company operates in six states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and West Virginia — wherein FirstEnergy undertook these maintenance initiatives.Details of the Maintenance WorkMaintenance work was carried out by FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries — Ohio Edison (OE), Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Toledo Edison (TE), Penelec (PN), Met-Ed (ME), Penn Power (PP), West Penn Power (WP), Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), Monongahela Power Company (MP) and The Potomac Edison Company (PE).The company’s operations included the inspection of heating equipment for substation components. Additional inspection was carried out for batteries as well as motors of these equipments. An equipment survey was carried out to check overheating and malfunctioning in case the heaters get cranked up for higher usage.Company bucket trucks and other vehicles are also checked to ensure safe operation during the winter, while a thorough tree trimming across the year has been FirstEnergy’s custom for maintaining proper clearances around electrical systems. This in turn offers protection against tree-related outages.Notably, the company conducted helicopter patrols to lookout for damaged wire, broken cross arms, failed insulators and other hardware problems across the transmission lines located in its entire service area.FirstEnergy’s Reliability Measures - Not NewTo enhance service reliability, it has been a common practice for FirstEnergy to conduct maintenance work like the aforementioned one, each year before the winter season arrives. In fact, since 2014, FirstEnergy has been focusing on modernization efforts to upgrade or replace existing power lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid and substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently.This led to the company’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan for upgrading and expanding regulated transmission capabilities. FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.Our ViewColder weather conditions increase the demand for electricity. However, heavy snow and winds can cause damage to wires and substations as well as transmission lines, thereby causing disruptions in electricity supply. Therefore, conducting inspections and maintenance of equipment before the onset of winter helps to minimize infrastructural damage and ensures better service.Following this strategy, FirstEnergy is conducting maintenance work across its service territory. Additionally, FirstEnergy has plans to transform itself into a complete regulated utility by mid-2018. The aforementioned efforts and investments to prepare for winters in its regulated operations are anticipated to aid this transformation.In line with this, we may expect other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) to undertake similar steps to carry out maintenance and reliability operations.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 7.2% outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.0% in the last three months.This was been driven by the company’s strong focus on upgrading its transmission lines and moderninzing its distribution network, through solid investments.Zacks RankFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
