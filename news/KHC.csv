0,KHC,"Shares of General Mills (GIS) sank Wednesday after the Cheerios and Yoplait maker delivered mixed results and lowered its growth outlook citing significant cost headwinds.General Mills' dive spread contagion through the packaged food sector, taking down shares of Kellogg (K), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Campbell Soup (CPB), J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years. General Mills is by far the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.They have tumbled since their Jan. 25 high of 60.69. Kellogg crashed 4%. Kraft Heinz lost 1.9%, hitting its worst levels since August 2015, while Campbell Soup sank 2.2%, reaching a 4-year low. Mondelez slid 0.8% and J.M. Smucker retreated 4.2%.Kellogg, J.M. Smucker, Campbell Soup and ConAgra all were among the S&P 500 index's worst-performers.The Minneapolis-based company reported adjusted quarterly profit grew 10% to 79 cents per share, meeting the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate. Revenue ticked up 2% to $3.88 billion, just short of views for $3.89 billion. Organic net sales — stripping out the effect of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures — were up 1%.Cost pressures are impacting the full-year outlook, said General Mills Chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening. General Mills cut its adjusted earnings growth forecast to flat to up 1% from up 3% to 4% earlier.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities,"" Harmening added. ""Because of our improved volume performance, we're also incurring higher operational costs.""Net sales for the North America retail segment rose 1% to $2.52 billion, thanks in large part to Canada. Yogurt and cereal sales fell in the U.S.Sales in the convenience stores and food service segment rose 3% to $460 million, driven by growth in frozen meals, cereal, and snacks.Europe and Australia sales grew 11% to $470 million, benefiting from favorable currency moves. Organic net sales slipped 1%.Asia and Latin America sales increased 3% to $435 million, also helped by foreign currency exchange. Organic net sales matched year-ago levels.  Asia markets saw higher sales, offsetting lower net sales across Latin America.General Mills said Wednesday its previously announced $8 billion acquisition of natural pet food brand Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) is expected to close before the end of fiscal 2018. Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam. Kraft Heinz's latest results show the cost-cutting strategy is running out of steam.Blue Buffalo shares edged 0.3% lower Wednesday. Walmart rose 0.3%, Amazon dipped 0.3%. and Kroger added 0.2%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Forget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish; S&P 500, Dow Jones Futures Await Fed Rate HikeThe Big Picture: Stock Bounce Leaves Much To Be DesiredNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out MondayThese 3 China Nets Are Flashing This Bullish Signal; This 1 Has Earnings Due'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

1,KHC,"Stocks opened to narrow losses Friday, then reversed into tight gains as the major indexes fought to add a sixth day to their rebound rally before heading into the holiday weekend.X The Dow Jones industrial average backed out of a fractional loss and gained 0.1%. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, then battled to a fractional gain. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2%, then pulled up to rise 0.1%, as Apple (AAPL) reversed its early loss and as Alphabet (GOOGL) led gains among three of the four among FANG stocks.The action across global stock markets was positive. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 ended the week on an affirmative note, climbing 1.2% Friday and rebounding 1.5% for the week. China's markets are closed for the country's Lunar New Year holiday.In Europe, the leading benchmarks continued hammering out solid gains in afternoon trade. The CAC-40 in Paris led the advance with a 0.9% gain.Housing starts jumped in January to their highest level in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported, reaching an annualized rate of 1.326 million. That was up from a rate of 1.21 million starts in December, easily outstripping consensus expectations for a rate of 1.232 million starts. Building permits, which provide a gauge of upcoming activity, were issued at a pace of 1.396 million, up from December's 1.3 million rate, and beating forecasts for a steady 1.3 million pace.U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Monday for the Washington's Birthday holiday.On the Dow, blue chips balanced out pretty quickly between decliners and gainers. Coca-Cola (KO) popped 1% to take an early lead after its fourth-quarter results cleared estimates and full-year guidance topped expectations. Coke's shares recovered nearly 4% this week, seeking to regain support and trading about 8% below their Jan. 26 high.Apple opened down 0.3%, but quickly reversed to a 0.4% gain. Five sessions of mostly strong-volume gains have hoisted the stock back above its 50-day moving average, and turned its Relative Strength line from a negative to a positive indicator. Friday will be a test to see whether Apple can hold support at its 50-day line.The four FANG stock tech leaders posted mild gains and losses. Google parent Alphabet led the group with a 0.6% gain. Swiss-based drugmaker Roche Holding (RHBBY) said it would pay $1.9 billion to acquire Flatiron, a New York-based developer of software for cancer records-keeping and research. Alphabet's Google Ventures had reportedly taken a stake in Flatiron, along with Roche and First Round Capital.Earnings news was having some impact on premarket action. In addition to Coca-Cola, big names reporting early included Deere & Co. (DE), up 0.7%, Campbell Soup (CPB), down 3.2%, and Kraft Heinz (KHC), down 6.4%.IPO Mulesoft (MULE) kicked up an early 11% gain after reporting late Thursday a loss of 12 cents a share and a 60% revenue gain, meeting analyst estimates for its fourth quarter. Full-year guidance topped views. The stock gained 9% for the week through Thursday, trading 11% below a May high and up 54% from their March 2017 IPO price.Investors continued to penalize earnings misses harshly, sending chip-equipment maker Cohu (COHU) down 14% after fourth-quarter earnings and first-quarter guidance fell short of targets.Arista Networks (ANET) tumbled 15%. The IBD 50 leader reported late Thursday its earnings were stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, but revenue only narrowly topped targets and the company's first-quarter outlook disappointed investors. The stock had punched 13% higher for the week through Thursday. The opening pullback stopped just short of the stock's 10-week moving average.Other stocks taking hard premarket hits following earnings included Cognex (CGNX), down 5%, Yamana Gold (AUY), down 8% and LogMeIn (LOGM), down 7%.RELATED:Auto Parts: Road To Recovery Lined With Ice, Aging Cars and AmazonApple's Stock Chart Improves, These 2 Tech Names Tumble LateThe Big Picture: Stocks Charge AheadWednesday's The Big Picture: The Market Outlook Has Changed AgainSolar Power Firm, Bermuda Bank Among Stocks Topping Buy PointsUsing The 50-Day Line For New Buying OpportunitiesLeading China Names Begin Year Of The Dog In Race To Form Bases

2,KHC,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

3,KHC,"Unilever (UN) shares tumbled early Thursday as the consumer goods giant reported sales in the third quarter were weaker than expected, while rival Nestle (NSRGY) warned restructuring costs would weigh on profit margins.Unilever, the owner of iconic brands such as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said sales grew 2.6% in Q3 from a year ago. Analysts had projected a sales gains of 3.9%. The Anglo-Dutch company cited competition from smaller and more nimble players, as well as natural disasters in global markets, for weakening sales.Shares dived 6.1% to close at 57.65 on the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day moving average. Unilever technically is back in buy range from a July breakout of 57.83, but the high-volume move through the 50-day should make investors wary.While Swiss rival Nestle grew sales in Q3, it cautioned Thursday that restructuring charges of 400 million to 500 million Swiss francs ($410 million to $512 million) would eat into profit margins in 2017, reports said.Unilever rejected a $143 billion bid by packaged foods giant Kraft Heinz (KHC) earlier this year, and an analyst told Reuters that lower ad and promotional spending since then may have hurt its sales.Meanwhile, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG) reports Friday and investors are bracing for tepid results.The analyst consensus view is for EPS of $1.07, up 4% vs a year ago, on revenue of $16.64 billion, up less than 1%, according to Zacks Investment Research.P&G narrowly won a proxy fight last week vs. Nelson Peltz, who is challenging the results. Peltz, who runs Trian Fund Management, wanted the Dow component to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy, core products.Nestle shares dipped 0.3% to 86.03 within a flat base with an 89.50 buy point Thursday. Procter & Gamble shed 0.5% to 91.59, undercutting a 92.10 buy point. Kraft Heinz lost 0.8%, hitting its lowest levels since early 2016.The consumer goods sector has cooled this year as tastes swing away from the largest players and toward niche and alternative brands. Grocery stores are adopting more-upscale private-label goods, putting a squeeze on branded food and consumer products.RELATED:Honeywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy FightRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

4,KHC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) on Tuesday announced that it will take a minority stake in Pilot Flying J, a large truck-stop and travel-center chain, that will eventually grow to 80%, deploying some of the holding company's massive cash stockpile.XBerkshire in August reported that it had accumulated roughly $100 billion in cash, raising questions about how the company would use it. But the company's recent acquisition attempts have been stymied.Berkshire was outbid by Sempra Energy (SRE) for Oncor Electric Delivery, a large electric utility in Texas. And earlier in the year, Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz (KHC) dropped its plans to buy Unilever.Under the terms of Tuesday's deal, Berkshire will take a 38.6% in Pilot Flying J. The Haslam family will continue to hold a 50.1% ownership in the company until 2023. FJ Management will keep an 11.3% stake until that time.In 2023, Berkshire will snap up an extra 41.4% stake in Flying Pilot J, giving him 80% total. The Haslam family will keep 20% ownership. Other details of the deal were not disclosed.""Jimmy Haslam and his team have created an industry leader and a key enabler of the nation's economy,"" Buffett said in a statement. Haslam is also the owner of the Cleveland Browns NFL team.""The company has a smart growth strategy in place and we look forward to a partnership that supports the trucking industry for years to come,"" Buffett continued.Berkshire's class-B shares dipped 0.2% to 185.41 on the stock market today. TravelCenters of America (TA), which also operates roadside stops for truckers and motorists, jumped 8.4% to 4.50.IBD'S TAKE: Berkshire, a hot growth stock on the IBD 50 list, has racked strong profits and is showing favorable technical traits. Will recent hurricanes damage its performance?Flying Pilot J, which has more than 750 locations in the U.S. and Canada and serves truckers and interstate travelers, would add to Buffett's transportation-related holdings, which include names like American Airlines (AAL) and General Motors (GM). Buffett also owns a large chunk of oil refining giant Philipps 66 (PSX).RELATED:Warren Buffett: Hurricane Harvey Was Worse Than Irma For Car Insurer GeicoThis Berkshire Hathaway Executive May Replace Warren BuffettInsurance Stocks Tumble As Hurricane Harvey Impact MountsBerkshire Hathaway Outbid By Sempra For Oncor Electric Delivery

5,KHC,"Investors will look to quarterly filings from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), George Soros' Soros Fund Management, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and other closely followed hedge funds — days after Warren Buffett's conglomerate reported results.XBerkshire's operating profits plunged 10.6% to $4.12 billion in the second quarter as lower investment gains and insurance underwriting losses offset improvements in its railroad business, it reported Friday.Over the past quarter, Berkshire Hathaway and its units made several key strategic moves to diversify its business and seize promising opportunities. Those initiatives included an agreement to buy Dallas-based power transmitter Oncor Electric Delivery for $9 billion; a 10% stake in Store Capital Group (STOR), a real estate investment trust or REIT that has rallied since Buffett's investment; and the rescue of a Canadian mortgage lender, Home Capital Group.The company ended the June quarter with about $99.7 billion of cash and equivalents, plus big stakes in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Apple (AAPL) and Coca-Cola (KO). It bought just over $3 billion of stocks in the quarter, Reuters reported, while it is poised to become Bank of America's (BAC) biggest shareholder thanks to a shrewd investment six years ago.Class-B shares of Berkshire Hathaway closed down 1% at 178.04 on the stock market today, snapping a 15-day win streak that was capped with a 52-week high of 179.99 Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The latest list of new buys of top-performing mutual funds shows strong demand for certain sectors and can also be used for stock investment ideas. Berkshire's rapid accumulation of Apple stock over the past year has been among its most notable portfolio moves.In Q1 2016, Berkshire had 9.8 million Apple shares, and that position grew to 15.2 million in Q2 2016, and ballooned to 57.4 million by Q4. In Q1 this year, Berkshire more than doubled its stake to 129.4 million.Berkshire's Apple purchases have coincided with dips amid concerns about slowing iPhone sales. But the legendary billionaire investor saw buy opportunities, and recently described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" and the iPhone as a ""sticky"" product.Apple shares ended Q2 of this year essentially unchanged vs. the start of Q2. But since Q3 has started, the stock has climbed into a new buy zone, helped by strong quarterly earnings and guidance.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Two Best Q1 Bets Include One He Didn't MakeStocks Edge Higher: Apple Retakes Buy Point; China Name Breaks Out

SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) lost nearly 3% each.The recent stock market pullback continues to create new opportunities for investors to buy equities.First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities (FPX) was featured in the Aug. 3 ETF column as it moved closer to its 50-day moving average line. A solid rebound off the support line could have set up a chance to buy. But it fell below the 50-day a few times over the next two weeks.Since then, it not only made up all the lost ground but has come back to score an all-time high as the market has rebounded. That shaped the right side of a flat base, which FPX cleared Friday. It slipped below a 61.55 entry during Tuesday's market sell-off. The ETF gained 6% from a late-April flat-base breakout to the start of the most recent pattern.The $867.3 million fund, which tracks the IPOX-100 U.S. Index, was launched in April 2006. The IPOX-100 is a market-cap-weighted index of the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. initial public offerings. It puts a 10% weighting cap on all component stocks and is reconstituted on a quarterly basis.The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 30 were: technology, 21%; health care, 19%; consumer cyclical, 15%; and financial services, 13%, according to Morningstar Direct.

The ETF bears a 0.60% expense ratio.IShares Russell Midcap Growth (IWP) climbed past a 110.76 flat-base buy point intraday Friday, before closing just below the entry. The fund was highlighted in this July 18 ETF column as it neared a flat-base buy point. It cleared the entry the next session but turned south along with the broader market in late July.The 16-year-old fund has amassed $7.6 billion. Technology accounted for 23.5% of assets as of Aug. 30, industrials 20%, consumer cyclical 19% and health care 14%. Among its top holdings: drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and gene-sequencing systems maker Illumina (ILMN).IWP's YTD and 15-year average annual returns of 13.8% and 11%, respectively, are ahead of the S&P 500 for those periods. The fund's expense ratio is 0.25%.Thursday's picks, Vanguard Growth (VUG) and iShares Russell 1000 Growth (IWF), both managed slight gains ahead of the Labor Day holiday. VUG is at the cusp of a 123.01 flat-base buy point; IWF is still in buy range from a breakout past a 123.42 flat-base entry.To learn more about how to invest, check out this page.RELATED:Biotechs Extend Gains; 2 Breakouts Put Apple, Amazon In FocusThese 2 Sectors Lead Upside; 2 Market-Beaters Close To Buy PointGold Rallies As Stocks Fall; Is It Too Late To Buy Gold?

He pointed out that the Shanghai Composite cleared resistance at the 3,300 level for the first time since January 2016.Retail, homebuilders and energy were among the biggest sector gainers. Oil also fared well with VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) up 1.5% and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) adding 0.3%. Biotech and chips were among the few losers.Gold ETFs perked up as the yellow metal's futures climbed 0.4% to $1,297.50. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) rose 0.6% each. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL) were up about 0.5% apiece.A pair of big-cap equity funds with stakes in three of Warren Buffett's biggest holdings are seeking support.Plenty of exchange traded funds have been pulling back to their 50-day moving average lines as the market has come off record highs.SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) has been trading near its 50-day the past week. It advanced nearly 4% from its last definitive bounce off the support line July 11 to its July 27 intraday high.The $871 million fund, which tracks the index bearing the same name, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. It provides exposure to the companies in the S&P 500 with the strongest growth characteristics based on sales growth, earnings change to price ratio, and momentum.That's led it to top five holdings in large-cap techs: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Billionaire investor Buffett upped his stake in Apple in Q2. Other big Buffett stocks in SPYG include American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO).Technology, at 36%, leads SPYG in terms of sector weighting as of Aug. 23. Consumer discretionary and health care make up about 16% each, followed by 11% in industrials.The ETF has outpaced the S&P 500 year to date through Aug. 23 with a 15.8% vs. 10.6% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. It's also topped the benchmark index over the longer haul. A 15-year average annual return of 8.9% edged past the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. SPYG carries a 0.15% expense ratio.Pacer Trendpilot 750 (PTLC), which tracks the Pacer Wilshire US Large-Cap Trendpilot Index, is also looking for support at its 50-day line. The two-year-old fund has attracted $530.2 million in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.62%.The Pacer Trendpilot series tries to avoid market downturns by paring exposure and investing in three-month U.S. Treasury bills if the underlying index closes below its 200-day average for five straight days. Likewise, if the underlying index closes above its 200-day line for five straight days, the funds will be fully invested in equities.PTLC's top holdings include the same techs as SPYG. It also owns the same Buffett stocks, as well as the two other Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) top-five positions: Kraft-Heinz (KHC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

8,KHC,"WPP (WPPGY) shares are plunging after the world's largest advertising company cut its full-year revenue forecast amid lower spending by customers, in particular consumer-goods manufacturers.WPP said like-for-like revenue growth is expected to be 0% and 1% in 2017. That's down from an earlier 2% forecast.  The stock fell as much as 12 percent in London, the worst drop in 17 years. U.S. shares fell 11% to 91 in morning trade on the stock market today in New York.Advertising companies worldwide are being hit as big clients like Unilever (UN) and Procter & Gamble (PG) focus on cost-cutting to cope with sluggish global economic growth and technological disruption. London-based WPP singled out ad spending on consumer goods — items such as laundry detergent and toothpaste that make up about one-third of its revenue  — as coming under particular pressure.Consumer-goods giant Unilever, one of WPP's biggest customers, said earlier this year that it would cut ad output by 30% and halve the number of creative agencies it works with to 1,500 from 3,000. That followed a failed takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC), which was the ""seminal"" moment in the first quarter, according to WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell.""That sent a shockwave through the industry,"" Sorrell said by phone. ""It obviously had an effect in terms of people spending, particularly in the packaged goods sector.""WPP, which also works for brands such as Ford (F) and Marks & Spencer, had already seen its shares fall 12% this year through Tuesday amid a difficult economic climate and pressure on its businesses in North America. It's now down more than 20% year-to-date in London. Its biggest rivals, including Interpublic Group (IPG), Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (OMC), are each down more than 8% this year.Publicis dropped 2.9% in Paris, while IPG and Omnicom were down more than 4% in U.S. trading. Shares of European television companies including TF1, ProSiebenSat.1 Mediaand ITVc declined as well.In March, WPP had its biggest drop since the financial crisis when WPP gave its initial forecast for 2% growth, the slowest pace since 2009.In the second quarter, WPP's like-for-like net sales fell 0.5% with July declining 2.6%, and North America and Western Continental Europe were the poorest performing regions.""Some of the weakness was expected, however this is still an incremental disappointment,"" Tamsin Garrity, an analyst at Jefferies Group, said in a research note.WPP said that it didn't experience any significant loss in revenue from clients or of data from a cyberattack it suffered in June. The attack took down WPP's website and caused disruptions across businesses including the creative agency Ogilvy and Mather, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.The attack cost WPP about $10 million, $5 million of which was covered by insurance, Sorrell said. The company will spend about $10 million to $15 million annually on increased protection against future attacks, he said.

9,KHC,"McCormick (MKC) agreed to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group's food business for $4.2 billion, adding French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce to its lineup of spices and seasonings.XThe deal brings a stable of well-known condiments to Sparks, Maryland-based McCormick. For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

SPDR Health Care (XLV) advanced 0.4%. It's near the top of a buy range from a 76.84 flat-base entry.

11,KHC,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance. The company has not yet named a permanent replacement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods.

12,KHC,"Kraft Heinz (KHC) sales and profit fell short of Wall Street expectations last quarter, adding pressure on the food giant to fuel growth with a large acquisition.X Earnings amounted to 90 cents a share in the fourth quarter, excluding some items, the company said on Friday. That was a nickel below analysts' estimates and a slight decline from 91 cents a year earlier. Though sales grew for the second straight quarter — reversing a string of declines — they still missed projections.One year after Kraft Heinz was rebuffed in a bid to buy Unilever (UN), the weak results threaten to renew speculation that it needs a blockbuster deal. TKraft Heinz shares tumbled 5% to 69.10 in the stock market today, falling to their worst levels since August 2015.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportThe results put a spotlight on the company's struggle to reinvigorate its stable of brands, which include Capri Sun, Lunchables, Oscar Mayer and Velveeta. Nuts and cold cuts were particularly weak in the U.S. last quarter, Kraft Heinz said.""This reinforces that growth is extremely challenged for this company,"" said Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""It's not surprising given the categories they're in and how difficult the retail environment is.""Sales came in at $6.88 billion last quarter, while analysts had estimated $6.91 billion on average.Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said the U.S. tax overhaul will help the company in 2018, but its results last year were disappointing. ""Our financial performance in 2017 did not reflect our progress or potential,"" he said in a statement.Since the U.S. tax changes passed late last year, the company has made plans to invest some of the savings. That includes using $800 million for capital expenditures, Kraft Heinz said. The company also vowed to put $1.3 billion into retirement benefit plans, and another $300 million toward ""strategic investments to build our capabilities, our people skills and our brands.""Kraft Heinz was created in a 2015 merger orchestrated by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Two years earlier, those backers had teamed up to take Heinz private  — with a strategy of slashing costs and ramping up profit margins. That's been the playbook at the new combined company too.But with the company announcing Thursday that it had cut more than $1.7 billion in expenses since the merger, there is growing pressure to find another target to buy. And without a major deal, Kraft Heinz is starting to look like other U.S. packaged food companies struggling with changing consumer tastes.""It's becoming more and more like the old Kraft,"" Shea said.

"
24,KHC,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, was previously part of Kraft, and the companies split in 2012.Buffett and Kraft Heinz didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez, declined to comment.

28,KHC,"Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. ""I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth.""As a result, he likes ""being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions."" Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).Secular growers ""are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects."" Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.""In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow,"" he said. ""The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth.""On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. ""What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential,"" he said. ""In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile.""The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). ""Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change,"" he explained.In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.""Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30,"" Kelley noted. ""It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.Kelley's take: ""While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations.""Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. ""When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected.""RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba Drive USAA Growth FundWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock Leaders

29,KHC,"Stocks opened higher Friday, after a better-than-expected July payrolls report and as drugmaker Merck (MRK) boosted the Dow.The  S&P 500 climbed 0.7% as of 10:09 a.m. ET, hitting a fresh all-time high. The Nasdaq rose about 1% to 5218, just below its record peak of 5231 in July 2015. The Dow industrials scaled up 0.8%.U.S. nonfarm payrolls expanded by 255,000 workers in July, the Labor Department said. That was down sharply from an upwardly revised 292,000 new hires in June.

Private payrolls were key to the results, adding 217,000 employees vs. expectations for 175,000.The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, vs. views for a dip to 4.8%, as the workforce participation rate notched up to 62.8%, from 62.7% in June.

The IBD 50 stock ended Thursday's session 9% above a 41.31 flat-base buy point, en route to contest prior highs from September 2014.Priceline (PCLN) booked a 5% gain on the heels of mixed second-quarter results reported late Thursday. The online travel site notched a strong beat on the earnings line, but revenue stopped shy of analysts' expectations, and management gave in-line guidance for the third quarter. Priceline has been in a gradual uptrend for the past six weeks, as it consolidates below a November high.Kraft Heinz (KHC) squeezed off a near-6% advance. It reported a better-than-forecast 93% jump in earnings per share and a 160% surge in second-quarter revenue, fueled by the two companies' merger a year ago. Organic net sales decreased by 5%.On the downside, IBD 50 stock Universal Display (OLED) collapsed 12%.

Hershey said the preliminary, non-binding indication of interest ""also included other non-monetary considerations.""Mondelez, the parent of snack brands such as Oreo and Nabisco, closed up 5.9% at 45.51 in the stock market today. Hershey shares, which had been halted at a 15% gain, finished 16.8% higher at 113.49, as investors see the company as still in play. Hershey rose to a record 117.79 earlier.PepsiCo (PEP) shot up 2.7% to 105.94, near a 107.04 buy point in a flat base. PepsiCo, which has major snack operations, reports quarterly earnings next week.A merger would have brought Mondelez brands such as Ritz crackers and Philadelphia cream cheese together with Hershey products like Twizzlers and Milk Duds.Mondelez already has some chocolate makers in its portfolio, including Cadbury, Toblerone and Milka. Kraft Foods acquired Cadbury in 2010, then split into two companies two years later and renamed its snack business Mondelez.Hershey already has ties to Cadbury, as it has a license to make and distribute Cadbury's York Peppermint Patties, as well as the Peter Paul Almond Joy and Mounds bars worldwide.

32,KHC,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKB) investments took a hit in the first quarter as financial stocks pulled down the value of his ""Big Four"" companies.Berkshire's holdings in American Express (AXP) and Wells Fargo (WFC) both fell in value, partly offset by increases in the other half of the ""Big Four"" -- top food and beverage stock, Coca-Cola (KO), and IBM (IBM), which both grew in value. Coke closed down 0.2% Monday, and IBM ended virtually flat.Financials were among the hardest-hit industries in the first quarter as interest rates lingered near record lows and the energy slump continued. Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter financial results on Friday after the market closed.Berkshire reported an 8% increase in first-quarter revenue to $52.4 billion. Net earnings rose 8.1% to $5.66 billion.And railroad, utilities and energy revenue slid 11% to $8.85 billion amid a slump in the railroad industry. The company expects that to change.""As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we concluded that there were no unrealized losses that were other than temporary,"" Berkshire said in its report on Friday.The Big Four accounted for about 60% of Berkshire's stock holdings as of March 31, up a bit from 59% the prior quarter. The value of the holdings changed from the end of 2015 to March 31 for various reasons, including company stock buybacks that boosted share values.The value of Berkshire's Coca-Cola shares rose to $18.6 billion at the end of the first quarter from $17.2 billion at the end of 2015. Its holdings in IBM grew to $12.3 billion from $11.2 billion.However, the value of its Wells Fargo stock slid to $24.2 billion from $27.2 billion and American Express fell to $9.3 billion from $10.5 billion.Railroad, utilities and energy stock holdings rose to $1.29 billion from $1.24 billion even as revenue from Berkshire-owned companies in its Railroad, Utilities and Energy business fell 11% to $8.85 billion, including a sharp drop by its BNSF Railway, which has been battered by lower shipments of energy products including coal and oil.Berkshire total stock investments in finance companies' stocks declined 5% to $106.42 billion.Berkshire bought 425 million shares of H.J. Heinz, now a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz (KHC) in June 2013 and has added to those holdings, which it said in the report have a ""liquidation preference of $8 billion"" as of March 31.

46,KHC,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) late Friday reported a 8% increase in first-quarter revenue to $52.4 billion, led by a 19% surge in insurance business revenue to $42.64 billion.But railroad, utilities and energy revenue slid 11% to $8.85 billion amid a slump in the railroad industry due to fewer shipments of coal, oil and other commodities. Finance and financial products revenue grew 14% to $1.39 billion.Net earnings rose 8.1% to $5.66 billion.Berkshire, which is a major shareholder in American Express (AXP), Wells Fargo (WFC), Coca-Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), said investments in equity securities dropped 4.8% to $106.4 billion in Q1 from $111.8 billion in Q4.Berkshire Class B shares were down less than 0.2% in after-hours trading after closing up 0.5% at 144.62 on the stock market today.

47,KHC,"PepsiCo's (PEP) improved productivity gains and reduced operating costs helped boost first-quarter profits, joining other packaged-food companies managing to carve out strong earnings amid weaker revenue.Excluding items, Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo earned 89 cents a share for the three-month period ended March 19, up 7.2% from a year earlier and 8 cents better than estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue fell 3% to $11.86 billion, missing estimates of $11.88 billion. It was the company's sixth consecutive quarter of overall revenue decline. Weaker foreign currencies cut 4.5 percentage points off PepsiCo revenue.Revenue in PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America unit rose 3%, but fell 3% in its Quaker Foods North America subsidiary. Beverage sales in North America inched upward by 1.5%, but plunged 26% in Latin America and slid 9% in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.PepsiCo reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance of $4.66, 4 cents below current estimates. PepsiCo stock closed virtually unchanged, dipping 5 cents or less than 0.1%, on the stock market today.Kraft Heinz (KHC) earned 62 cents on $7.1 billion in sales in Q4, beating estimates. The company has announced more than 5,000 jobs cuts and the closure of more than five plants in a plan to cut $1.5 billion in annual expenses by the end of next year.ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported a 25% revenue decline during its fiscal Q3, while its quarterly profit fell 3.4%. Earlier this year, the company sold its private label business to TreeHouse Foods (THS) for $2.7 billion. It had previously bought the unit for $5 billion about three years earlier. It has announced plans to cut annual costs by $3 billion, in part by laying off 1,500 employees.General Mills (GIS) saw an 8% drop in revenue during its fiscal Q3. Its profit slumped 7.1%. The company has moved to cut costs, shutting down factories and eliminating jobs. Its divestiture last year of its Green Giant unit cut sales growth by 3 percentage points. Foreign currency issues adversely impacted revenue growth by 4 points.Meanwhile, PepsiCo rival Coca-Cola (KO) will announce Q1 results on Wednesday before markets open. The Atlanta-based company is expected to report earnings of 44 cents a share, down 8.3% from a year earlier. Revenue is expected to fall 4% to $10.3 billion.Image provided by Shutterstock.

48,KHC,"U.S. companies are still desirable, but less popular targets for those in an acquisitive mood as the first quarter comes to a close.Mergers in the U.S. are down 40% year-over-year, marking the nation's lowest total global share for the January-March time frame since 2012, despite the competing bids to buy Starwood Hotels (HOT), according to Dealogic.U.S. target mergers and acquisitions volume totaled $248.2 billion, a 40% reduction from the $415.4 billion last year. U.S. target M&A comprised 36% of total volume during the quarter.Overall, global M&A volume fell 25% compared with a year ago, slipping to $701.5 billion. The number of deals has fallen 19% to 8,347. It's a year of tough comparisons, as 2015's first quarter at $934.5 billion was the biggest for deal making since 2007's record high of $1.1 trillion.Mergers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell 19% to $217.9 billion, the least of the three major global regions that Dealogic tracks. EMEA-targeted M&A comprises 31% of the global total, its highest quarterly share since the second quarter of 2013. Asia-Pacific targeted mergers comprises 28% with $195.9 billion of the global total, on par with 2015's first quarter.Chinese companies are among those with the biggest appetites for deal making, with ChemChina's $48 billion bid to buy Syngenta (SYT) being the largest on record for the quarter. The Johnson Controls (JCI) bid to buy Tyco International (TYC) for $16.6 billion is the quarter's largest U.S. telecom deal. Overall, telecom deals fell 50% to $39.7 billion via 151 deals, its lowest first-quarter volume since 2012.Starwood Hotels (HOT) finds itself in the middle of a merger love triangle, of sorts, with China's Anbang Insurance's $14.7 billion bid competing with Marriott International's (MAR) $13.6 billion bid for its rival hotel chain. The dining and lodging sector had its biggest first quarter for mergers since 2006, with $25.6 billion via 198 announced deals, much of the total dollar amount boosted by the Starwood bid.Technology was the quarter's top sector with $100.3 billion spent on 2,115 deals, up 10% year over year -- and containing its highest first quarter since 2000's $190.8 billion. Real estate was the second-largest sector, with $69.5 billion on 440 deals, though that was down 22% compared with 2015.Health care mergers plunged 56% to $58.7 billion, its lowest volume in four years, though it's the victim of tough comparisons as the sector had back-to-back record-breaking years in 2014 and 2015.Oil and gas volume was $24.9 billion via 208 deals, down 41% year-over-year and its lowest volume since 2005 and its lowest first-quarter activity since 2003.

49,KHC,"Stocks swung into firm early gains Friday, as an upward revision to GDP growth, oil prices and earnings reports buoyed investor confidence.The Nasdaq jumped to an early lead, up 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Dow tacked on a 0.3% gain.The stock market today  entered Friday's session with the Nasdaq up 1.7%. The S&P 500 opens ahead 1.8% and back above its 50-day moving average. Holding that level of support, and finishing out the week without incurring any distribution days, would be a nice feather in the cap of the market's young uptrend.Distribution days occur when an index declines in rising volume. Accumulation occurs when markets advance in rising volume. One shows institutional investors are selling, the other shows them buying. Market conditions are generally better for individual investors when the big funds are in a buying mode.Another encouraging point: Small caps are outpacing the general market. The Russell 2000 starts Friday up 2.1% for the week. But both the Russell 2000  and the Nasdaq are less than 2% below their 50-day lines and still face possible resistance at that level.Oil prices, for all their volatility, were also a positive this week. Oil traded up more than 1% Friday morning, above $33 a barrel and up almost 13% for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) reports its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET. Gold dipped slightly, holding above $1,237 and up less than 1% for the week.The economy expanded 1% in the fourth quarter, according to revised estimates from the Commerce Department. That was up from an initial guess of 0.7% and comfortably above consensus projections for a downshift to 0.4%. The outlook on prices also improved slightly, with the Q4 GDP price index up 0.9% -- up from 0.8% and a slice above expectations for no change.The University of Michigan reports its final consumer sentiment reading for February at 10 a.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow stocks advanced in premarket action, but gains were mild. Home Depot (HD) led with a 1% increase.Kraft Heinz (KHC) kicked up more than 5%, outpacing energy and mining issues to lead the S&P 500. The ketchup, Jell-O and Velveeta giant reported Q4 earnings slipped less than expected. Revenue outpaced analyst forecasts and declared a quarterly dividend of 57.5 cents.Stamps.com (STMP) spiked 21% after a big fourth-quarter beat. Shares ended Thursday below their 50-day moving average in the ninth week of a possible cup base. Premarket action implies an open above that pattern's potential buy point of 114.36. Premarket moves in futures do not always carry through into regular trade.Other notable premarket moves driven by earnings reports included 15% from  Splunk (SPLK), 13% from Herbalife (HLF) and 10% each from Baidu (BIDU) and J. C. Penney (JCP).On the downside, Universal Display (OLED) crashed 15% after unexpectedly weak Q4 results. Both earnings and revenue missed consensus estimates, and management's full-year revenue guidance was far below expectations.Overseas markets moved modestly higher. The FTSE 100 and the CAC 40 were tracking toward gains of around 2% for the week. The DAX showed a gain of less than 1%.China's Shanghai Composite added 1% Friday, narrowing its loss for the week to 3.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 2.5%, ending the week up 0.4%. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 eked out a 0.3% advance Friday. That gave it a 1.4% gain for the week and putting the index 9% above its Feb. 12 low.Image provided by Shutterstock.

51,KHC,"No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, Campbell Soup (CPB) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.That is well above peers like J.M. Smucker (SJM), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as Kellogg (K), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

54,KHC,"X Shares of IBM lurched 2.5% lower early Friday amid news that Warren Buffett has been dumping the tech giant in 2017. Investors digested the news ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) annual meeting, a day when the Berkshire CEO answers shareholders' questions.Late Friday, Berkshire reported Q1 net earnings dropped 27% to $4.14 billion as insurance losses and adjustments soared 146%, but revenue climbed 25% to $65.19 billion. Insurance premiums earned nearly doubled to $21.75 billion, and railroad, utilities and energy revenue grew 6.3% to $9.4 billion.Among the potential topics that billionaire investor could address are his reasons for selling IBM (IBM), Apple's (AAPL) rising dividends, turbulence in the airline industry and a merger snub for one of his top stocks.Buffett has sold a third of his stake in the tech giant over the first and second quarters, considerably trimming his 81 million shares as of December 2016, CNBC reported.""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,"" he said in an interview, adding IBM stock had not performed in line with his expectations.The iPhone maker is a sure bet for the spotlight at Saturday's meeting.Buffett doubled his stake in Apple at the start of this year, owning $17 billion of the stock as of February. He disclosed a position in Apple in 2016 after sitting out the tech giant's hot growth streak over the past decade. He attributed the change of heart to Apple's ""enormously useful product"" and intelligent deployment of capital.Buffett's ""invest in what you know"" principle made him a big buyer of the best high-dividend stocks such as Verizon (VZ), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM) and Coca-Cola (KO). He likes financially sound companies with a durable competitive advantage that reward shareholders. Dividends can be a sign of a quality company.Apple's hefty dividend hike may make the stock more attractive for Buffett, though he said in February that Apple stock was ""at a price different than I would buy it now.""Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.38 in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock fell fractionally Wednesday and Thursday after reporting tepid revenue and iPhone sales for the second fiscal quarter but significantly raising its dividend and buyback.Berkshire Hathaway has also been upping its stake in airline stocks — another big change of heart. He is reported to have owned more than 7% of the total common stock of each of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as of February.With airlines executives in congressional crosshairs after a spate of disturbing passenger-related incidents, Buffett may be grilled himself on his airline positions.Other headwinds for airline stocks include high labor costs, increased competition and discounted fares that cut into profits.Still, all four of the big U.S. carriers have moved back above their 50-day moving averages.If Buffett stays true to form, investors can expect some frank discussion of Kraft Heinz's (KHC) failed $143 billion merger bid for Unilever (UN) and what other steps Kraft may do to revive growth.Berkshire is one of the largest stakeholders in the $108 billion company behind beloved household names such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid.After Wednesday's market close, Kraft Heinz reported earnings per share and revenue below Wall Street views. EPS climbed 15% to 84 cents a share while sales dipped 3% to $6.36 billion. Analysts had expect EPS of 85 cents and sales of $6.462 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Sales have fallen for four of the last five quarters, while there may be limits to Kraft's aggressive cost-cutting measures under Berkshire and co-lead investor 3G.Kraft shares fell sharply intraday Thursday, but closed up 0.6%. The stock dipped 0.1% Friday morning.In previous annual meetings, Buffett has weighed in on Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) flawed business model, defended his sizable stake in Coca-Cola, and knocked hedge fund managers (between playing ping-pong with a giant paddle and doing a ukulele singalong).RELATED:Apple Investors Find Comfort In 10.5% Dividend HikeLawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz

55,KHC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

Panera already accepted a $7.5 billion, $315-a-share offer from JAB Holding last week.Brazilian private equity giant 3G Capital is seriously mulling a rival bid for the 2,036-store chain, the New York Post reported, citing sources. But CNBC's David Faber reported 3G is not interested in Panera.Panera Bread rose to 316.21 soon after the opening bell but pared gains to just 0.2% at 313.82 in the stock market today, under JAB's offer. Panera surged 19% last week on the JAB deal.Brazil's 3G Capital is the majority shareholder in Restaurant Brands (QSR), which runs Burger King and Tim Hortons, and recently agreed to buy Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI). Berkshire Hathaway owns a small stake in Restaurant Brands.3G and Berkshire jointly own just over 50% of Kraft Heinz (KHC). Kraft Heinz made a short-lived bid for Unilever (UN) earlier this year.Luxembourg-based JAB owns several coffee-heavy enterprises, including Keurig Green Mountain, Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.Panera would have to pay a $215 million termination fee if it accepts a higher offer.RELATED:JAB's $7.5 Billion Panera Buyout Comes As Coffee Business Gets TougherWhole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers

57,KHC,"By the end of a 175-mile bike marathon in 1990, Gary Erickson was exhausted and disgusted.""The energy bars I was eating tasted like dirt and they weren't working like they were supposed to,"" Erickson told IBD. ""Cyclists never complained about them, we just thought they were the bitter pill we had to swallow to help us perform.""He thought he could concoct something better as co-owner of a bakery in Berkeley, Calif. Erickson, his wife Kit Crawford, and his mom studied nutrition as they experimented. They learned that the highly processed ingredients of the typical bar provided a sugar rush, not sustained energy. They developed alternatives that were healthier and tastier and found an eager audience.In February 1992, they launched the first Clif Bars (named after Erickson's dad). By year's end their company, Kali's SportNaturals (renamed Clif Bar & Co. five years later), had sales of $700,000. Industry sources estimate that the privately-held Emeryville, Calif., company has had a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% in recent years, with 2016 revenues of over $700 million. The Ericksons are now co-chief visionary officers, with Kevin Cleary serving as CEO since 2013.Erickson, 59, grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. He did a wide variety of jobs that allowed him the free time to do a lot of rock climbing and extreme biking. He wrote in his 2004 memoir, ""Raising the Bar: Integrity and Passion in Life and Business,"" that in 1990 he was living in a garage with no bathroom or heat, barely surviving on $10,000 a year. Two years later, he scraped together $1,000 to invest in his energy bar business.The Clif Bars utilized brown rice syrup and barley malt, instead of corn syrup or lots of white sugar. In place of refined white flour, he used good sources of natural energy like nuts, soy and oats. Today, about 77% of the ingredients are organically grown or certified as being grown in a ""sustainable"" way.And the Ericksons delivered on taste, with the line now including White Chocolate Macadamia, Peanut Toffee Buzz, Maple Nut and Chocolate Almond Fudge.All of this has built up a fiercely loyal customer base, which shows that profits and idealism can be compatible in a successful business model.The initial marketing strategy was to pass out samples at sports events that might have as few as 200 attending, but would build buzz. ""Most big corporations won't compete at that level,"" Erickson said. Within a few months of launch, demand led 700 bike shops to carry his products.The company also sponsored up-and-coming athletes. ""We'd rather sponsor someone who came in second place, and is humble, than another who came in first, but is arrogant,"" Erickson said. ""We look for athletes who are hardworking, friendly and who know how to have fun. It's about more than getting to the finish line.""Erickson is proud of his company maintaining its original principles, rather than compromising to reach a larger audience faster. On a bike ride in 1986 he observed that the big roads on a map, marked in red, were the most direct ones, while white roads were small, meandering ones — which gave him an insight fundamental to his future business. ""Companies on the red road listen to a lot of noise: the market, shareholders, the board, economic consultants, advisors and conventional wisdom,"" he said. ""Clif Bar is a white road company.""In 1999, the company launched its Luna line of bars, designed for women's nutritional and energy needs, and they have been marketed creatively at events like breast cancer walks and baby fairs. The company has organized  an annual Lunafest of films by, about and for women, with 180 screenings across North America each year.Also in 1999, sales reached $39 million.Clif Bar's main competitors in the energy bar niche had been bought by deep-pocketed corporations: PowerBar by Nestle (NSRGY) and Balance Bar by what is now Kraft Heinz (KHC). Five companies approached Erickson about acquiring Clif Bar. When Quaker Oats, now part of PepsiCo (PEP) offered $120 million in 2000, he was tempted.But before signing the contract, he took a walk around the block to think about the implications. By the time he returned, he had realized that selling would mean he would have no control over whether the new owners would maintain the integrity of the brand, so he terminated the discussions. His investment bankers told him he was crazy and predicted that he would be out of business within a few months.""I had been relying on the logical side of my brain,"" Erickson said. ""Once I started listening to the emotional side of my brain, I had more clarity and knew keeping the company private was the best decision.""Clif Bar has gone far beyond those basic bars since then. Its ever-expanding product line include bars with a nut butter filling; others with whey protein, an ""energy food"" for endurance athletes; Clif Bloks energy chews and Clif Shot energy gel (both providing a burst of energy while training or racing); and the Clif Hydration electrolyte drink mix (to help athletes retain fluid).At the time of the near-sale, there were 100 employees. There are now 1,100 and they own 20% of the company through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). Clif Bar is often ranked as one of the best places to work and it's no wonder that it has just a 5% turnover rate. Benefits include subsidized day care for kids, the ability to use the gym and yoga studio, walk dogs, do dry cleaning or volunteer in the community on company time.Clif Bar moved into its Emeryville headquarters in 2010. Built as a valve factory in World War II, it still retains its industrial feel, but is certified platinum in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the measure of impact on the environment in construction and operation. Most of the wood was reclaimed from old gym bleachers, barns and shipping containers. The space is almost silent because of sound-absorption panels made from recycled jeans. It features one of the largest ""smart"" solar arrays in U.S. business. And its trucks run on recycled vegetable oil.All of these ""touchy-feely"" things make hard business sense because they appeal to customers who want to support companies whose values they share.Erickson and Crawford set up a family foundation in 2006, largely to promote organic seed research and to conserve crop genetic diversity. In 2004, their Clif Family Winery and Farm had its first product release. Cleary runs the day-to-day Clif Bar operation, giving Erickson and Crawford the time and space to think about the larger strategy.""Gary has always led with an unwavering commitment to his values and vision,"" said Cleary. ""Clif Bar could have been just a successful energy bar company, but he recognized early on that we had greater purpose, that we could do well by doing good. We make decisions that add up to the long-term health of our company for our five bottom-lines: brands, business, people, community and the planet.""We look forward to continuing to do that, while scaling our impact and continuing to innovate, finding new products that feed and inspire adventure and expanding our distribution domestically and internationally. We're celebrating our 25th birthday this year and truly feel like we are just getting started.""Founded Clif Bar & Co. to provide great-tasting, nutritional energy foods and snacks.Overcame: Temptation to sell the company for a high price when it was up against deep-pocketed competitors.Lesson: Treat employees really well and they'll be very productive.""I think the most important lesson a small business can learn is to be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability.""More About Leaders & Success:Jim Cline Helped Build A Teetering Trex Into A Global LeaderFor Kayak Founder, Team-Building Comes FirstAt Amazon's Zappos, CEO Tony Hsieh Delivers On Being DifferentPhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising Champ

"
59,KHC,"Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell nearly 2% Tuesday afternoon after the food giant ""amicably agreed to withdraw"" its $143 billion, $50-a-share proposal to merge with consumer goods conglomerate Unilever (UN), but deal buzz continued to support the two giants as well as other food and consumer product makers.""Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard,"" said the Sunday release. ""Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.""The joint statement from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-backed Kraft Heinz and Unilever spurred a 180-degree shift from Friday's market action, in which Kraft Heinz's stock spiked 10.7% on public confirmation of the bid. Friday's statement from Kraft Heinz had also indicated that it would continue to pursue the parent company of Dove and Vaseline, despite its initial rejection of the offer. Shares ended the day off 1.78 to 94.87.Unilever shares plunged nearly 8% to 45.09 on the stock market today after soaring 15.3% Friday. The company, which trades as both Unilever NV and Unilever PLC (UL) said last week that the proposal ""fundamentally undervalues"" the company and provides no financial or strategic merit for Unilever shareholders.The quick reversal in Kraft Heinz's intentions may stem from Warren Buffett's sentiment toward hostile takeovers. Berkshire Hathaway ""will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions,"" he said in his 2015 annual letter to shareholders. He acknowledged that some hostile bids are ""justified.""""We, though, will leave these 'opportunities' for others,"" he wrote. ""At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.""Berkshire Hathaway and 3G engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz. Berkshire Class B shares were up fractionally.A Kraft Heinz-Unilever merger would have made for the second-largest food-and-drink company in the world, according to Bloomberg data, bringing together brands such as Oscar Mayer and Planters and Lipton and Hellmann's. The combination of Kraft and Heinz two years ago created the fifth largest.While Kraft and Unilever retreated Tuesday, they kept a good share of Monday's gains on speculation that industry consolidation could still happen.Other consumer goods heavyweights were on the move Tuesday as speculation circulated that Kraft Heinz might have another acquisition target in mind. Colgate Palmolive (CL) was up 1.2%. Clorox (CLX) ticked up 0.9%. Procter & Gamble (PG) edged 0.5%. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) inched up 1.2%.Colgate, Clorox and Kimberly-Clark posted big gains Friday on the initial Kraft-Unilever news. Dow component P&G inched up to a 2-year high Friday after surging earlier in the week on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management had taken a $3.5 billion stake.Meanwhile, Mondelez International (MDLZ) was up 4.9% as it announced an overhaul of its snack line, while General Mills (GIS) added 2.8%.

"
60,KHC,"While merger discussions roil the food industry, Mondelez International (MDLZ) is doing its best to increase sales on its own.The company is introducing a new line of crackers and snack bars made without artificial ingredients and GMOs, and it's revamping some of its existing products to better appeal to millennials. The rollout is Mondelez's biggest since it was created by splitting with Kraft Foods in 2012.The maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuits, which has posted declining sales the past three years, is renovating its portfolio as consumers increasingly demand less-processed snacks. The new products, called Vea, were developed in-house by a ""startup"" team — a sign the food giant is trying to be more entrepreneurial.Vea arrives as traditional packaged-food companies have been gobbling up upstart brands in response to the changing tastes, and as Kraft Heinz's (KHC) freshly abandoned courtship of Unilever (UL) (UN) raises the prospect of bigger realignments in the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Mondelez shares rose sharply Tuesday, retaking their 50-day line on revived hopes that Kraft or another company might make a takeover bid. Mondelez has generated profit growth even as revenue falls, much like Kraft and some of its peers. How long can the snacks giant rely on cost cuts and other margin-boosting moves without topline growth?Tim Cofer, Mondelez's chief growth officer, said the Deerfield, Ill.-based company considered making an acquisition but ultimately decided to develop the new food line itself.""There was nothing out there that hit this space as well as what we developed,"" he said. Shares ended the day up nearly 6% to 44.97.The Vea products are slated to reach shelves across the U.S. in July, and they will eventually be expanded to overseas markets — where the company generates most of its revenue. Mondelez also is removing genetically modified organisms from Triscuits and will tout that the crackers are made from just three ingredients.Mondelez's profit margins have lagged behind competitors, and the company is under activist pressure to improve its performance. Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld has been cutting costs to boost results, but the strong dollar has battered the company, which generates more than 70% of its sales outside North America.Last year, Mondelez made a failed bid for Hershey (HSY), an attempt to crack the U.S. chocolate market. The merger approach was also seen as a defensive move: By bulking up, Mondelez would be less of a takeover target itself.Kraft Heinz, which was formed when Kraft Foods merged with Heinz in 2015, made a $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever last week, but formally pulled the offer after it was rejected. Mondelez has been seen as a possible target of Kraft Heinz as well.Ultimately, companies have to figure out a way to increase sales if they want to keep investors happy, said Asit Sharma, an analyst at the Motley Fool.""Investors understand that cost-cutting and productivity initiatives have a limited shelf-life in boosting earnings,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, revenue growth will be top of mind for investors.""RELATED:Kraft Heinz, Unilever Fall After Bid Nixed, But Deal Buzz Continues

68,KHC,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett praised ""ambitious"" immigrants' contribution to the ""miraculous"" American story, rejected claims that stock buybacks are ""un-American"" and ripped Wall Street investment fees in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders on Saturday. Meanwhile, Berkshire reported declining operating profit but big unrealized gains in last year's investments in Apple (AAPL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers paying off.The typically optimistic Buffett said that stocks are ""virtually certain"" to rise in years to come. And he hailed America, with an implicit rebuke of anti-immigrant sentiment.""One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago ' a span of time less than triple my days on earth ' Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.""As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American ' characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn't the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I'm not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)He pointed out that many companies that Berkshire invests in, including Bank of America (BAC), have been buying back shares. ""We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. ... When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""Buffett said that wealthy Americans have been suckered out of more than $100 billion over the past decade seeking ""superior investment advice.""""When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,"" he wrote. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.""But Buffett had nothing but praise for Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who popularized ultra-low fee index funds.""If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle,"" Buffett wrote.Buffett didn't offer hints about his possible M&A plan and was mum about Kraft Heinz (KHC), which made a short-lived $143 merger bid for Unilever (UN) this month. Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz.Net income rose 15% to $6.29 billion, boosted by a $1.1 billion gain from investments and derivatives.

69,KHC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) saw second-quarter net earnings rise 25% to $5 billion, or about $2.03 per Class B share, a penny above estimates.The conglomerate late Friday said revenue grew 6% to $54.46 billion, though total revenue was lighter than analyst consensus for $56.44 billion. Revenue from Berkshire's flagship insurance businesses climbed 9.9% to $43.59 billion.""Our insurance underwriting operations generated increased net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015,"" management said in a regulatory filing.That reflected foreign-exchange rate fluctuation for Berkshire's reinsurance activities overseas, as well as an increase in underwriting gains for its Geico business, partly offset by lower gains from General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group operations.Berkshire saw a 10.3% drop in its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad revenue to $8.85 billion, down from $9.87 billion in the second quarter of 2015, as railroads continue to be slammed by lower shipments of petroleum, coal and other products.IBD'S TAKE: While Berkshire Hathaway and other large diversified manufacturers have generally reported middling results, smaller rivals have outperformed the market. To find out which companies in the group are the highest rated, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Berkshire earlier in the year made a roughly $1 billion investment in Apple (AAPL) at a time when sales of its iPhone seemed to be slowing. However, in its July 26 earnings report, Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales, driving its stock up nearly 7% on July 27. Other core Berkshire holdings include Coca-Cola (KO), Wells Fargo (WFC) and oil and gas refiner Phillips 66 (PSX).But Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell to $15.75 billion as of June 30 from $23.42 billion on Dec. 31, the company said in its 10-Q statement.

Its stock dropped to a 2016 low of 123.55 on Feb. 3, in sync with the early-year market pullback, and then turned up. It's risen 19% since then and was trading above both its 10-week average and its 200-day line.Apple rose 0.8% to 108.37.

74,KHC,"No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, Campbell Soup (CPB) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.That is well above peers like J.M. Smucker (SJM), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as Kellogg (K), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

75,KHC,"Warren Buffett said Saturday that the net worth of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) rose $15.4 billion in 2015, boosting the per-share book value of both its Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.Buffett was upbeat in his annual letter to shareholders, saying it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America for 240 years, and ""now is no time to start.""""America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs,"" Buffett said in the letter.In the 31-page missive, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in Q4, crushing consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.75.For the full year, earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion. Total revenue for the year rose 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014.Berkshire owns Geico Insurance, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, and as of January, Precision Castparts. Berkshire also holds significant holdings in companies such as Kraft Heinz (KHC), IBM (IBM) and  Wells Fargo (WFC).It should be no surprise that the company's Railroads, Utilities and Energy business fared the worst amid declining rail shipments and plunging gas prices.  Still, revenue for that business was down just 1.7% in Q4 at $40.004 billion. Earnings fell 2.9% to $1.507 billion.Total revenue for the company's flagship insurance businesses continued to show big gains, rising 10.9% in the quarter to $162.89 billion. But earnings fell to $4.9 billion in 2015 vs. $5.2 billion in 2014.  Earnings for the underwriting business soared 60% to $306 million, while earnings for the Insurance-investment income unit were up 17.4% at $1.033 billion.Earnings for other businesses and miscellaneous items climbed 36.3% to $1.827 billion.Buffett commented on the $37.2 billion purchase in January of aerospace components maker Precision Castparts, which he described as a newcomer to the ""Powerhouse Six"" businesses in the company's Railroads/Utility/Energy group. ""PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earnings power.""He also commented on a proxy proposal regarding climate change that's on the agenda for the company's annual meeting, which is slated to be streamed live for the first time ever on the morning of April 30. Buffett said concerns about how climate change might affect the company's insurance payouts are unwarranted because Berkshire's insurance policies are typically repriced every year, factoring in increased risk such as climate change.Commenting on stock investments, Buffett said the company increased its interest in each of its top four holdings last year: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM and Wells Fargo.  Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo shares were essentially flat in 2015, while IBM and American Express were big losers.Berkshire most recently has been buying big blocks of oil refiner Philips 66 (PSX) and as of Dec. 31 owned 55.38 million shares, giving it a 10.5% stake in the company, which has continued rising this year.Buffett also noted that in 2015 Berkshire invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment, 86% of it deployed in the U.S.Berkshire Hathaway shares declined for most of 2015 and into early 2016, and hasn't been above its 200-day line since a brief spell last July. But the stock is up 7% from an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and closed at 131.92 in Friday trading on the stock market today, down 0.3% for the day.

76,KHC,"Only a few stocks remain on IBD's IPO Leaders screen, a reflection of the difficulties new issues are having in the market correction.Indexes and exchange traded funds (ETFs) tracking new issues aren't doing much better. In fact, investors would be better off picking some of the individual stocks in the screen than using funds.The IBD New Issue index is about 20% off its prior high. This week it touched the lowest level since October 2014. The index, which tracks stocks that went public in the past 15 years, has not fared much better than a couple of ETFs that follow the IPO market.First Trust U.S. IPO Index Fund (FPX) is 23% off its peak, and earlier this week it sank to its lowest level since November 2013, if you exclude the Aug. 24 mini-crash. Renaissance IPO (IPO) is 35% off its high and at all-time lows, excluding Aug. 24.Although both ETFs are flagging, the difference in their top components has affected performance.Renaissance IPO's largest holdings include stocks that have sold off sharply, such as Synchrony Financial (SYF) (nearly 11% of the fund), Alibaba (BABA) (9.8%), Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (8%) and JD.com (JD) (about 5%).  All those stocks are at least 30% below their 52-week highs.First Trust U.S. IPO's top holdings, such as Facebook (FB) (11% of the fund) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) (6.2%), are within 14% of their prior highs. AbbVie (ABBV), another top holding at 9.5%, has swooned 26% and hurt the fund relatively more.Renaissance IPO's top components had their IPOs since 2014. First Trust U.S. IPO has companies that went public farther back. General Motors (GM), certainly no new kid on the block, is on the First Trust portfolio. It started trading again after its reorganization in 2010.Within the IPO Leaders screen, Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) has faltered since it cleared the 17.23 buy point of a cup with handle last month, but shares are just 7% off the prior high.Store Capital (STOR) is near a new high, extended from a breakout past 23.23. Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR) has been trying to break out to new highs. All three stocks are real estate investment trusts, which have fared better as defensive investments.

77,KHC,"After the Great Recession, as declining equity prices pulled the stock market down, dividends became a bigger part of total returns. That enabled dividend stock mutual funds to outperform the S&P 500 for the first part of the past 10 years.But the ongoing bull market — which is more than six and a half years old — has given growth stocks and mutual funds that focus on them a new head of steam.Growth stocks in the form of the S&P 500 have generally outperformed dividend stock funds since early 2012.And their success has enabled them to post a better average annual return than dividend funds over the entire past 10 years.The S&P 500 has notched a 7.04% yearly average gain over the decade, going into Monday.The index's current 12-month dividend yield is 2.18%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. have gained an average of 5.65% a year for their investors in that decade.Their 12-month dividend yield is 2.05%.If you had invested $10,000 in a typical dividend mutual fund on Sept. 30, 2005, it would have grown to $17,471 by Dec. 11 of this year.It would have blossomed into $20,327 in the S&P 500 over the same period.A small number of those funds specialize in stocks with rising dividends or that aim to boost their dividends.Among those, the $746 million Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund has the top average annual return over the decade. Its average yearly gain is 7.98%.But in this volatile year, when the S&P 500 is down 0.27%, Ave Maria has slid 7.06%.It now has a dividend yield of 1.26%.Among its top holdings is Lowe's (LOW), which has an IBD Composite Rating of 97.The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings, with 99 being the highest.The stock, whose dividend yield is 1.5%, is up 9% this year. Its earnings per share rose 13%, 15% and 36% the past three quarters.Ross Stores (ROST), also an Ave Maria holding, has a Comp Rating of 89.The discount retail chain's stock is up 14% this year. It has an 0.9% dividend yield.Kraft Heinz (KHC) has a so-so Comp Rating of 71.The food conglomerate is up 34% this year. Its dividend yield is 3.3%.Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

78,KHC,"After a few rocky quarters, earnings growth is heating up again for Campbell Soup (CPB). On Tuesday, Campbell delivered earnings of 95 cents a share for its fiscal Q1 of 2016 — up 22% from a year earlier and the firm's biggest gain in three years. In the four quarters prior, profit went from falling 13% to rising 18%.Q1's sales, however, were down 2% to $2.20 billion, hurt in part by currency headwinds. Campbell's top line has now fallen for four straight periods. Revenue was higher in only one of its three operating segments. Sales at its Campbell Fresh division, which includes juices, smoothies, dips, salsas and refrigerated soups, rose 8%. But sales at its Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and its Global Biscuits and Snacks units fell 2% and 6%, respectively.For its full fiscal 2016, Campbell expects sales to be flat to down 1% due to currency translations. Previously, the company expected sales to be flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings are slated to rise 4%-7%, or to $2.75-$2.83 a share. Current consensus estimates call for $2.63 a share, up 5%.Earlier this month, Campbell declared a quarterly dividend of 31.2 cents a share to be paid Feb. 1 to shareholders of record Jan. 11. It last announced a dividend hike in September 2013. Campbell, which was founded in 1869, has paid shareholders dividends since going public in 1954.On an annual basis, Campbell pays nearly $1.25 a share, which works out to a yield of about 2.4%. Its yield is on the lower end of the 17 companies in the Food-Packaged industry group that do pay dividends. B&G Foods (BGS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) have the highest yields at around 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.On Tuesday, the stock gapped above its 50-day line and edged past a 52.47 buy point from a flat base intraday but lost some steam by the close. It gave a better showing Wednesday and touched its highest levels since January 1999.

85,KHC,"First impressions sway purchases. How to be different in a desirable way: Stand out. The look, sound or feel of a product's exterior is often what keeps consumers coming back.""Those little bitty delighters that you can build in — that's what gets you the re-buy,"" said Scott Jost, product/brand innovation strategist with Berlin Packaging.The firm's clients include Anheuser-Busch (BUD), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL).Packaging was once solely about looks. ""It was basically just a beauty show,"" Jost told IBD. ""The world's more sophisticated now.""Consultancy Smithers Pira forecasts that the luxury packaging market will grow 4.4% by 2019 — the uptick driven by upscale brands angling for fresh ways to make products stand out. Draw them in. If your new smartphone came in a plastic clamshell used for toys, the process of ripping into the container would devalue the experience — and make that phone seem cheaper. Jost likens the process of opening a premium package to the elegance of a Japanese tea ceremony: ""It's about the experience we deliver."" Get familiar. To figure out how to create the right look and feel, Jost's team starts with a phase-zero analysis — a 50- to 60-page study of the product's category. This research looks at the product and its target consumers to ""document why they do what they do,"" he said. ""You have to understand what the category conventions are."" Delight them. Shoppers almost unconsciously notice texture, finishes and sounds.""It can be the sound of a snap. I drive some sonic benefits into the package,"" Jost said. Such nuances influence the ""hidden mental calculus"" of why we buy one product rather than another. Build status. Some brands key in on the showoff effect by creating a look that communicates coolness of the item and its owner.""Badging means it's something I want to leave out on my nightstand so everyone can see I have great taste,"" Jost said.Premium spirits apply this principle. Be precise. Consumers make snap assessments all day long.""Indeed, the Web is all about first impressions and the need to be able to understand content at first glance,"" said Chip Kidd, author of ""Judge This."" Communicate visually.  In his work as a book cover designer, Kidd uses clarity and mystery to attract attention.""Mystery, by its very nature, is much more complex than clarity, and I try to create a balance between the two,"" he said. Apply simplicity.  ""Clarity is sincere, direct, reasonable, basic, honest, perfectly readable. No-nonsense,"" Kidd said. ""But when it's automatically applied to everything, things can get kind of boring.""Save it for vital and specific information.""You should be clear when you need people to understand you immediately,"" he said. Add allure. Apply mystery when you want to hold someone's attention.Intrigue provides ""a puzzle that demands to be solved, a secret code you want to crack, an illusion that may not be an illusion at all, a dream you're trying to remember before it fades away,"" Kidd said.He points to Diet Coke's limited edition can redesign. It doesn't say Diet Coke, instead focusing the design around large, graphic D and K letters to evoke the brand.""First impression: Instantly recognizable. I don't even need to be able to read it. Thank you for trusting me,"" Kidd said.

105,KHC,"Kellogg Company’s (K  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher sales, cost-saving initiatives as well as higher contribution from the acquisitions of protein bar maker RXBAR and Brazilian food group Parati helped the company offset the industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings BeatFirst-quarter comparable earnings of $1.19 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. The bottom line increased 11.2% year over year banking on higher business delivery, lower effective tax rate and reduced restructuring charges.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.4 billion, increasing 4.7% year over year. The upside can be primarily attributed to the October 2017 takeover of RXBAR, improved business delivery along with favorable currency translation. The top line outpaced the consensus mark of $3.32 billion.Currency and acquisitions had a 2.5% and 1.6% positive impact on revenues in the quarter. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) were up 0.6% compared with 1.5% decline in the previous quarter. This marks the company's best performance in several quarters. Except North America, organic sales increased across all other regions.Volumes increased 2.9% in the quarter, while remaining unchanged in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, price/mix had a 2.3% adverse impact on sales versus 1.5% negative contribution in the last reported quarter.Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteMargin DetailsKellogg’s adjusted gross margin (currency-neutral adjusted) in the quarter was down 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago level.Kellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 14.7%, reflecting an improvement of 40 bps year over year. The uptick can be attributed to higher sales benefit and strong productivity savings related to the Project K restructuring program, particularly last summer’s exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales improved 1.8% (down 0.6% organically) from the prior-year quarter to $2.3 billion. The upside was mainly driven by the acquisition of RXBAR and favorable currency translation. However organically, sales declined owing to the impacts related to the transition out of DSD in the U.S. Snacks business as well as continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business. Volumes increased 1.5% against a decline of 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Price/mix was down 2.1% compared with 2.6% decline in the prior reported quarter. Adjusted (comparable) operating profit grew 3.7% in the segment.Europe: The segment’s revenues of $587 million improved 14.4% and currency had a 12.2% positive impact on the same. Organically, sales were up 2.2% in the quarter compared with 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit improved 1.1% as well.Latin America: Revenues of $232 million in the segment improved 5.3% (organically, sales were up 3.3%). Price/mix, volume and currency had a 0.5%, 2.8% and 2% positive impact on sales, respectively. However, adjusted operating profit plunged 32.8% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: The segment’s revenues of $252 million improved 11% on the back of strong growth in cereals in the emerging markets and continued expansion of Pringles. Organically, sales increased 6.2%, better than 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter. While volume increased 7%, price/mix had a negative impact of 0.8% on sales. Adjusted operating profit improved 17.3% in the Asia Pacific.2018 ViewKellogg expects revenue growth to be in the range of 3-4% (versus flat growth expected earlier) on a currency-neutral basis for 2018. On an organic basis, sales are expected to decline within 1-2%, of which 1% is related to the negative impact of U.S. Snacks’ DSD transition, including its list-price adjustment and rationalization.It still anticipates adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 9-11% on constant currency.Adjusted constant-currency operating profit growth is projected within 5-7% (versus 4-6% expected earlier). Cash from operating activities is expected to increase in the band of $1.7-1.8 billion for 2018 driven by higher net income, sustained working-capital improvement and benefits from the U.S. Tax Reform.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

107,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Higher input costs, lower sales in the United States along with higher investments to boost capabilities seemed to have adversely affected this food company’s quarterly performance. However, lower taxes and higher pricing have benefited the results.Shares of Kraft Heinz have gained 3.9% in the after-hour trading session on May 2, following the earnings release.In the first quarter, the company re-aligned some of its international businesses. It formed a new reportable segment — Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) by shifting Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment to the historical Europe reportable segment. Now, the remaining AMEA operations became the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) operating segment.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 89 cents surpassed the consensus mark of 82 cents. Also, the bottom line increased 6% from the year-ago figure on lower effective tax rate.SalesReported sales of $6.3 billion fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion by 0.7%.

Organically, sales decreased 1.5%.Volume/mix declined 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as Rest of World. That said, Canada and EMEA registered solid retail growth in the quarter. Foodservice also gained in the United States and EMEA in the quarter.Pricing was up 1%, same as the preceding quarter, driven by price improvement in Rest of World markets and the United States.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.2 billion increased 2.1% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was down 2.7% to $1.8 billion in the quarter due to higher input costs, lower volume/mix and more spending in strategic initiatives.The Kraft Heinz Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Kraft Heinz Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteQuarterly Segment DiscussionUnited States: Net sales of $4.4 billion declined 3.3% year over year. Organic sales also fell 3.3% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 4.1% due to lower shipments of nuts, cold cuts and frozen potatoes, and in parts of the cheese business. Pricing was up 0.8%.Canada: Net sales of $484 million grew 9.8% year over year owing to a 4.8% favorable impact from currency. Organically, sales were up 5% as well.

108,KHC,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, it surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company. Kellogg missed analysts’ expectations on sales in five of the past 11 quarters.The food industry in the region is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about more than 65% of Kellogg’s total revenues. Hence, it is evident that revenues generated from this segment largely impact overall sales of the company. The segment is further categorized into U.S. Morning Foods, U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty and North America Other.In the last reported quarter, Kellogg’s total North America sales declined 1.7% year over year to $2.1 billion (down 3.3% organically), owing to the exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business (particularly in the health and wellness segment). Moreover, in 2017, sales declined 2.6% from the prior-year period (down 3% organically). The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at $2.3 billion, implying a 1.7% decline year over year. Conversely, these are likely to improve 7.5% sequentially.North America Business by SegmentU.S. Morning Foods:  Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, accounting for 40-45% of sales, has been performing poorly for quite some time now. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. In the last reported quarter, revenues slipped 4.9% and declined 5.2% in 2017. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to decline 4.6% year over year but improve 2.4% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Snacks: This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 5.8% from the year-ago level due to discontinued shipping through its DSD distribution system, reducing workforce, and exiting leases for its distribution centers, trucks, and other equipment and SKU rationalization. In 2017, the segment’s net sales dropped 4.1% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with revenues likely to decline 5.9% year over year but improve 1.7% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Specialty: This segment’s sales rose 2.1% in the last reported quarter, marking the 10th straight quarter of sales growth, given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels, such as K-12 schools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Specialty segment revenues is pegged at $396 million, implying a 0.3% year-over-year and 37.5% sequential increase.North America Other: Segmental revenues grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter on contribution from frozen foods. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 10.9% from the prior-year quarter and 5.8% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.Europe revenues in the first quarter are likely to witness 12.1% growth from the year-ago level but a decline of 6.5% from the prior quarter. However, revenues for Latin America are likely to witness a 0.9% decline from the year-ago level and 15.1% from the prior quarter. For Asia Pacific, revenues are expected to register 4.7% year-over-year rise in the quarter. Sequentially, revenues are expected to be in line.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. In 2017, net sales declined 0.7% (down 2.6% organically), with volumes down 3.1% as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline. Although the top line has been discouraging, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to lend support to the company’s bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also likely to subside, further supporting EPS growth.List price adjustments owing to its DSD transition and weak cereal volumes in the United States are gross margin headwinds in the first quarter. Higher logistic expenses also remain a drag. Expenses related to brand building initiatives are likely to hit operating margin to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings increased 5.5% year over year in the last reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Kellogg does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kellogg is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

109,KHC,"The picture so far this earnings reporting cycle has been quite rosy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 267 S&P 500 members have reported quarterly results. So far, 76.8% of these companies have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 73.8% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies have increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues have risen 10%.Further, earnings and revenues are well on track to mark the highest growth in seven years. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues rose 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.A Look at Consumer StaplesThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 15 are expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth this season. The Consumer Staples sector being one of them is expected to record earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue increase of 3.1%.The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% (15 of 16) of all Zacks sectors, thanks to several bottlenecks. The sector has long been grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition. This, in turn, has created significant pricing pressure, compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. Owing to such deterrents, the sector has lost 5.9% in a year, while the S&P 500 market gained 11.7%.Amid such challenges, companies operating in the segment have been trying to keep afloat through innovation, strategic buyouts and restructuring efforts in sync with a changing consumer landscape. Additionally, the recent tax cuts are expected to favor Consumer Staples companies.Considering the diverse factors, let’s see what’s in store for the following stocks when they release their quarterly results on May 2.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterHow Are TAP, KHC, CLX and EL PlacedMolson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is expected to witness year-over decline in revenues in first-quarter 2018, owing to soft sales volumes in the United States. For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, input cost inflation is a concern as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. To top it, Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21%, which dim the possibility of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nevertheless, the company is focused on strengthening its above premium category along with expanding its portfolio through innovation. It has also been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profits. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms, Zacks analysts expect earnings in the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days. (Read More: Will Soft U.S. Volumes Dent Molson Coors Q1 Earnings?)The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) has been experiencing top-line weaknesses for a while, thanks to unfavorable demand conditions in the United States and Canada. Further, the company’s performance in first-quarter 2018 is expected to be dented by increased retail competition in developed markets, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions. (Read More: Will Weak Sales Hurt Kraft Heinz's Earnings in Q1?)Owing to such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect only nominal growth in Kraft Heinz’s first-quarter sales. Further, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been striving to boost its performance through savings initiatives, innovations and strategic investments to enhance brand performance. However, such efforts are less likely to reflect in the results this season. Further, owing to its Earnings ESP of -0.20%, a bottom-line beat seems unlikely this time around.The Clorox Company’s (CLX  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance is likely to benefit from dedicated brand management, cost savings and productivity initiatives. Also, it undertakes strategic partnerships to expand capabilities across its online and brick-and-mortar platforms. Recently, management agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. Additionally, it is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In the light of such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $1,511 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.However, Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue. Margin was strained by escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of the transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost-saving initiatives, which might continue to drive expenses and hurt profits. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year. Further, Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.33% and a Zacks Rank #4 indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat this earnings season. (Read More: Will Clorox Retain Positive Earnings Trend in Q3?)The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to reflect well-chalked buyouts, innovation, saving efforts, extensive market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network. This cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions, such as BECCA and Too Faced, to enhance its portfolio. It also boasts a strong online business and expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the years to come. Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged as a major sales driver. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by continued investments in emerging markets, particularly Asia, along with double-digit increase in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network.Buoyed by such factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.02-$1.04 for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the prior projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07. Moreover, the company’s Earnings ESP of +0.67% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season.  Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management forecasts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter.However, management anticipates lower sales from North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Also, the company has been grappling with gross margin declines for over four quarters now.

Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc.

QuoteArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is a leading food processing company. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

111,KHC,"Leading pharmaceutical and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has started a strategic review of Horlicks — a famous malted milk hot drink in India — along with other smaller nutrition products like Boost. The company is also planning to offload its 72.5% stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Although it is still unclear which company GlaxoSmithKline would prefer selling Horlicks to, market speculations point at Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever.Other potential bidders include Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Indian company ITC Ltd., PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and JAB holdings.Why is Horlicks Up for Sale?Glaxo recently inked a deal with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to take over the latter’s 36.5% stake in its Consumer Healthcare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). In order to fund the deal, Glaxo is looking to vend Horlicks and other nutrition products. Moreover, Glaxo wants to shift focus toward over-the-counter and oral health categories.But why sell GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare? The Indian arm of the pharmaceutical giant has been grappling with sluggish sales for quite some time now. Revenues decreased 3.1% in 2017 and 0.5% in the first nine months of 2017. This clearly indicates that Horlicks, which accounts for about 90% GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare sales, has also not been performing well.Moreover, malt-based drinks are losing sheen in India of late. Major players in the health food drinks category have been facing the brunt of increased popularity of breakfast cereals and intense competition. Nevertheless, focusing on providing actual nutritional benefits and not just on enhancing taste can change the scenario. According to a study by Research and Markets, India's malted drink market is expected to see a CAGR of 17.4% during 2017–2021.Who All Will Show Interest?It goes without saying that adding Horlicks will drive market share for the buyer as it currently dominates the malt-based drink market in India. According to GlaxoSmithKline, its nutrition products portfolio, including Horlicks, had raked in total sales of $550 million in 2017.According to market sources, the stake is worth $3.1 billion as per current market prices but Glaxo wanted a premium in any sale. They also estimate valuation of the consumer health nutrition business at around $4 billion.Apart from the companies mentioned earlier, other potential bidders include Mondelez International, India’s ITC Ltd., PepsiCo, Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola and JAB holdings.Nestle had previously expressed interest in Horlicks. The company already has a minor presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo.  Beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola could also consider buying Horlicks as recently they have been keen on diversifying product offerings given the slump in carbonated beverage drink sales.Mondelez, which operates thorough Cadbury Ltd., has a commanding presence in India. The company generates about 40% revenues from emerging markets, which include India and is keen on expanding in developing countries to gain scale in its categories or distribution capabilities.Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from Glaxo in 1994. The company is currently facing a decline in sales primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Thus, expanding business in emerging markets can prove beneficial.European investment firm, JAB Holdings, backed by Austria’s billionaire Reimann family is also a key contender. The company has been actively taking over companies in the consumer and food sectors over the past few years.Associated British Foods might also show interest in order to expand in India although the size of Glaxo’s business could be a drag, according to a market source.GlaxoSmithKline expects the outcome of the strategic review to be out by the end of 2018. So for now, it’s a wait-and-see story.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

112,KHC,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to buy out the latter’s stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) for $13 billion (£9.2 billion).With the acquisition of Novartis’ 36.5% stake, Glaxo will now have 100% ownership of its Consumer Healthcare unit, which includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase.Glaxo is optimistic that the deal will be accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018 and thereafter improve the company’s cash flow.Shares of the British drug maker were up around 2.6% on Tuesday in response to this positive news. Glaxo’s stock has risen 10.1% this year so far, against a decline of 3.4% for the industry.Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions. Glaxo owned 63.5% share of the JV.As part of the same asset-swap, Novartis also acquired Glaxo’s oncology products for $14.5 billion and up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments. In exchange, Glaxo acquired Novartis’ Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for $7.1 billion ($5.25 billion upfront and up to $1.8 billion in milestone payments) along with royalties.In the 2015 deal, there was a clause, which gave Novartis the right – exercisable from Mar 2, 2018 to Mar 2, 2035 – to ask Glaxo to purchase its stake. With the latest deal between the companies, this overhang has been removed.The transaction, expected to be completed in the second quarter, is subject to approval of Glaxo’s shareholders.Also, Glaxo said it is looking at strategic alternatives for its Horlicks and other nutrition products to help fund the deal. These nutrition products are mostly sold by Glaxo’s Indian subsidiary, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo owns 72.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, which it said will also be included in the strategic review process. Food giants, Nestle, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever are being speculated as the frontrunners to bid for the Horlicks business.Glaxo’s latest deal with Novartis comes in less than a week after it announced that it is withdrawing from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod)Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction.At that time, Glaxo’s chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley said that management is interested in deals that will improve the company’s returns and not “compromise on its priorities for capital allocation.”Conversely, Emma Walmsley justified the new agreement to buy out Novartis’ stake by saying that it “addresses one of its key capital allocation priorities.”Glaxo expects its Consumer Healthcare business to deliver sales and earnings growth and also approach operating margins in the mid-20’s percentage range by 2022. We believe the Novartis deal is more prudent than buying Pfizer’s Consumer unit, which would have reportedly cost Glaxo around $20 billion.For Novartis, the sale price of this non-core business reflects an “attractive value”. Novartis said it expects to use the proceeds from the sale for driving shareholder returns, invest in core products and also for bolt-on acquisitions.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

113,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from continued strength in its snacks and frozen products, higher net price realizations, and improved mix. However, inflation in commodity prices, and higher freight and logistics costs continue to hurt margins.Recently, the food giant reported third quarter of fiscal 2018 results, wherein the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same. Meanwhile, the company’s shares have plunged 26.5% in the last three months, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 12.6% decline.Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have moved south by 4.7% and 1.3%, respectively, in the last seven days. The company’s weak sales growth trajectory and margin woes may impact the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. A Look at the Company’s Sales Performance and OutlookGeneral Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic food. Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing.After sales declined 3.5% in the fiscal first quarter, General Mills’ sales showed marked improvement in the fiscal second quarter. Total revenues of $4.2 billion grew 2.1% year over year, owing to higher sales across the board.General Mills also continued its sales growth momentum in fiscal third quarter. The company’s sales of $3.9 billion improved 2.3% from the prior-year quarter owing to higher sales across the board. Higher net price realizations and improved mix helped General Mills report improved sales performance. Favorable currency translation rates also supported its top line.The company’s legacy North America Retail segment’s revenues grew 1% to $2.52 billion due to 6% growth in the Canada operating unit, 3% in U.S. Snacks, and 2% in U.S. Meals & Baking business units. Continued strength in its snacks and frozen products has helped the company post better numbers. Moreover, the Soup and Baking segments also positively impacted the company’s sales.The company’s focus on consumer-focused innovation seems to be bearing fruits. New products like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, Oui by Yoplait, and Yoplait Mix-Ins have been generating solid demand. Nature Valley snack bars have also witnessed higher demand.That said, yogurt and cereals continue to remain a drag on its top line. Net sales were down 8% in the U.S. Yogurt and 1% in U.S. Cereal in the recently reported quarter. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, U.S. Cereal net sales were down 1% and sales in the U.S. Cereal unit were down 14% from the year-ago level. While management is taking initiatives to reinvigorate this priority business through innovation and increased promotional support for new products, we are yet to see significant growth.For fiscal 2018, General Mills reiterated its sales guidance and expects its organic sales to remain flat. The company’s sales are expected to benefit from its new products as well as from its acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products. However, sales weakness in cereals and yogurt remain a headwind.Higher Costs to Compress MarginsGeneral Mills continues to disappoint on the margins front. Gross margin and operating margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) and 120 bps, respectively, in the fiscal third quarter. The downside was due to higher input, freight and manufacturing costs.A tepid sales environment, higher spending to support top-line growth and price competition among retailers are expected to hurt margins of the packaged food manufacturers like General Mills, Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and others.General Mills expects inflation in commodity, transportation and other operational costs to adversely impact its fiscal 2018 margins. Hence, the company cut its operating profit and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. General Mills expects its operating profit to register a decline of 5-6% in fiscal 2018. Earlier, it had expected its operating profit to either decline 1% or remain flat.Also, the company, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has slashed its expectation for adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth from flat to up 1% versus prior expectation of 1-2% growth.

114,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 90 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. Also, the bottom-line declined 1.1% from the year-ago figure on higher effective tax rate.SalesReported sales of $6.88 billion fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.90 billion by 0.3%. However, the top line inched up only 0.3% year over year owing to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. The reported figure includes a favorable 0.9% impact from currency. Organically sales decreased 0.6%.Volume/mix declined 1.6% compared with a decrease of 0.2% in the previous quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as cheese and coffee in Canada.Pricing was up 1% compared with an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter driven by price improvement in Rest of World markets and the United States.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.4 billion decreased 4% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was up 4% to $2 billion in the fourth quarter owing to cost initiatives, lower overhead costs and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher input costs and lower volume/mix.Quarterly Segment DiscussionKraft Heinz reports through four segments – the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of World.United States: Net sales of $4.8 billion declined 1.1% year over year. Organic sales also fell 1.1% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 1.7% due to some distribution losses on Planters in the club channel, lower shipments in natural cheese and service-related losses in cold cuts. However, this was partially offset by higher demand in Lunchables, P3, Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, macaroni and cheese category. Pricing was up 0.6% owing to higher prices in cheese and seasonal items.Canada: Net sales of $591 million declined 4.1% year over year with a 4.5% favorable impact from currency. Organically, sales declined 8.6% as well. Volume/mix was down 8.6% on lower inventory levels at retail, the discontinuation of select cheese products and lower shipments of coffee. Meanwhile, pricing remained flat compared with the prior-year quarter.Europe: Net sales of $656 million improved 9.3% year over year with a 8.4% favorable currency impact. Organically, sales were up 0.9%. Volume/mix inched up 1.8% on robust consumption gains in condiments and sauces in Germany, Spain and France. However, pricing declined 0.9% due to changes in promotional spending in Italy, the UK and Russia.Rest of World: Net sales of $843 million increased 5.2% year over year despite a 1.8% currency headwind. Organically, sales grew 7% on 5.7% higher pricing.

115,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close.Top-line weakness in the past several quarters has been marring Kraft Heinz’s prospects. In 2017, net sales declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. The dismal scenario is not expected to see a turnaround in the to-be-reported quarter. Kraft Heinz’s sales are expected to witness negligible growth (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2018, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Increased retail competition in developed markets, distribution losses for Planters in the club channel leading to lower volumes in United States, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions and trade spend timing will inhibit top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, requires sustained improvement in sales for the company to regain its position. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.4 billion reflects 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.Again, lower retail inventory and lower promotion activity in Canada will hold back organic growth potential in the quarter to be reported. Segment’s revenues of $462 million reflect 4.3% fall for the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $837 million are likely to witness 1.3% growth. Meanwhile, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $650 million indicates an increase from $543 million a year ago.Increased Investments to Hurt MarginsIn order to boost demand, the company is consistently investing in building go-to-market capabilities, e-commerce and digital investments in selected markets, leveraging distribution and whitespace gains in developing markets, launching a strong pipeline of “Big Bet” products innovation. These initiatives are likely to pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings to DeclineDismal revenue growth and increased costs owing to various investments undertaken will likely translate into lower earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall. The expected decline in earnings indicates the fact that cost-savings and productivity-improvement initiatives will not be able to provide impetus to earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts earnings miss for Kraft Heinz in the first quarter.Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.

116,KHC,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales.Let’s Have a Look at Mondelez’s Past PerformanceMondelez witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 11 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales were down 0.1% and its volumes decreased 0.6 percentage points (pp) in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has declined more than 9% in the past year, compared with its industry decline of 15.3%.In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.9%, courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets. Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 6.3% and the Power Brands witnessed a 3.7% increase in revenues.Regionally, Latin America, Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA) and Europe registered an increase of 4.2%, 2.6% and 5% in revenues, respectively. However, North America’s revenues declined 0.6%.Organic revenues increased 2.4%, softer than 2.8% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement was primarily driven by the Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia, Middle East & Africa.Pricing increased 2.1 pp, more than 1.5 pp in the preceding quarter. Volume/Mix had a positive impact of 0.3 pp on the revenues. In the third quarter, it was 1.3 pp.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1In order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital.Mondelez’s advertisement spend is biased toward the high-margin Power Brands. Mondelez is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands and innovation, funded by cost savings from its restructuring plans. The company is thereby reaping benefits from the Power Brands that include Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with improved volumes in its Power Brands. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio are also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India, along with strong pricing in the emerging markets are added positives. Notably, the company has been experiencing improvements in the emerging markets.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 37.8% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 8.5% decrease sequentially but 6% year-over-year improvement to $2.6 billion, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. North America segment, comprising about 26.2% of the total revenues, is expected to witness $1.64 billion of revenues in the first quarter, compared with $1.8 billion in the last reported quarter and $1.65 billion in the year-ago period.Latin America revenues of $921 million indicate an increase from $900 million in the preceding quarter and $910 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in nine of the past 11 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Overall, first-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes, as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.Mondelez International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mondelez International, Inc.

117,KHC,"Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe. This would effect companies like Daimler AG, which owns the Mercedes brand of vehicles. The EU, in return, has earmarked a total of $294 billion in U.S. goods imported to Europe if Trump goes after car imports.We’ve already seen how threats to EU imports have impacted companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) and Kentucky bourbon distributor Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report). This morning, Zacks Stock Strategist David Borun contemplates which corporate domino might be next to fall amid our current trade friction scenario: Harley-Davidson Reacts to EU Tariffs; Who’s Next?For Canada’s part, our neighbor to the north’s retaliatory measures are even more specific: while the country looks to charge 25% on imported U.S. steel and iron, a further 10% tax would be levied on consumer goods from tomato ketchup to coffee beans to dishwasher soap, totaling $12.6 billion in goods, total. This would have a negative effect on companies like Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).Mexico has just elected a new president, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO), so it remains to be seen how new leadership in the country will deal with Trump’s new trade tactics. Reportedly, the country has already targeted U.S. imports on items like Florida orange juice such as Minute Maid, owned by The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).June PMI ManufacturingWe see some key manufacturing data for the month of June this morning after the opening bell: Project Management Institute (PMI) and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) results. The Markit Manufacturing PMI's previous month reported 54.6. ISM reports new results around 10am ET, along with new Construction spending for May. ISM is expected to come in at 58.3% for June following the 58.7% previously, whereas construction looks for break-even results after a +1.8% headline read in the prior month.

118,KHC,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

120,KHC,"Monday, July 2, 2018Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe.

121,KHC,"Shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) rallied 9.4% yesterday on hearsay of a possible takeover by The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). While both companies remained silent, sources revealed that Kraft Heinz looks keenly interested in buying Campbell Soup, which has been struggling with its soups and C-Fresh businesses for quite some time.These headwinds have been hurting Campbell’s top line for more than a year now, as a result of which this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 17.7% in a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 7.3%. Also, Campbell is struggling with strained gross margins, due to input cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses (particularly in C-Fresh) and promotional spending (especially in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages).These factors, along with a soft C-Fresh performance, led to a disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018. Unfortunately, management expects its ongoing challenges to persist, which along with its increased investment spending is likely to hurt fiscal 2019 performance. These factors led to a lowered earnings outlook for fiscal 2019.However, during the third-quarter conference call, Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin, revealed plans to bring the company back on track by carrying out a complete review of the company’s strategic plans, portfolio alignment, resource allocation and cost of capital, among others. Per sources, this strategic business review could also include a conceivable divestiture or division of the company’s operations. In fact, there have been speculations that apart from Kraft Heinz, Campbell could also get buyout proposals from General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), if it puts itself up for sale.As for the alleged buyout by Kraft Heinz, reports suggest that Campbell may not be a strategic fit for the company. This is because Kraft Heinz itself has been struggling with its top line, owing to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Thus, adding Campbell may not solve Kraft Heinz’ top-line issue, though it may augment the latter’s bottom line. Notably, Kraft Heinz has been making constant attempts to enhance its performance, through cost and productivity improvement efforts along with innovation and marketing strategies.All said, let’s see what’s in store for these food companies and if the aforementioned speculations actually surface. Talking of speculations, we had another one on similar lines, last week. Incidentally, there were rounds that Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) is trying to strike a deal to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report). If the consolidation materializes, it is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity, at a time when demand for this category is booming. However, both Conagra and Pinnacle Foods remained silent on the matter.While Conagra has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), both Pinnacle Foods and Kraft Heinz carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

123,KHC,"As prevention is better than cure, it is prudent to dump losing stocks at the right time than regret later. Incidentally, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has seen its shares slump more than 30% in the past year, significantly wider than the industry’s 2.4% dip. This leading consumer packaged food company has been bearing the brunt of shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food, which has been denting its sales for long.What’s Affecting Kraft Heinz?The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. The food industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share with packaged food items losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making sales growth difficult to come by.Consumption trends in a number of its key categories like ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and salad dressings are on the decline.In 2017, net sales of $26.2 billion declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Two of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the biggest decline in Canada (down 5.2%). The United States registered a decline of 1.5% in sales. Organically, sales declined 1.5% in the United States and 7% in Canada.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of net sales, needs sustained improvement for the company to return to healthy growth.These factors have made analysts hesitant about Kraft Heinz, as evident from the downtrend in estimates. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and 2018 went down from 94 cents to 84 cents and from $3.94 to $3.85, respectively, over the past 60 days. Though the company is undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements and innovating in line with consumer preference, the efforts are yet to reap significant benefits. This makes the road ahead bumpy for Kraft Heinz.Not All is Lost for the Food IndustryIn order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channelling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are also going for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves special mention. General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.4 Food Stocks That Are Better PlacedRanked among the top 40% of all Zacks industries, the Zacks Food-miscellaneous Industry space has some bright spots for investors to put their funds in. Despite the headwinds looming over the industry, several firms have managed to stay afloat, gaining from strategic endeavors to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and the improved economic scenario. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four food stocks that have been performing well. These stocks have outpaced the industry in the past year and are well poised for the long term. Additionally, these stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank.US Foods Holding Corp. (USFD  -  Free Report) has rallied 29.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 climbed 15.2% over the past 60 days. Earnings for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock are expected to grow 48.6% in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors can also count on Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1. Estimates for 2018 improved from $2.60 to $3.25 in the past 60 days. Earnings are expected to grow 41.9% in 2018. Encouragingly, the stock has gained 112.1%, cruising ahead of the industry.We also suggest investing in Darling Ingredients Inc. (DAR  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 rose 58.7% over the past 60 days. Shares have jumped 26.2% in the past year. Also, Darling Ingredients has impressive earnings per share growth rate of over 100% in 2018. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Finally, we suggest investing in United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1. The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the past four quarters. Estimates for fiscal 2018 trended upward from $2.82 to $3.06 over the past 60 days.  Earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected to grow 19.1%. Notably, the company has seen its shares rise almost 1% in the past year, faring way better than the industry.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

124,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 21, before market open.A Look at General Mills’ Margins Performance in Q2It isn’t unknown that a seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales and thereby profit level.General Mills and other food majors have been focusing on various strategies to combat weak sales trajectory. However, higher promotions and advertising spending to support innovation and new product launches have been putting pressure on these companies’ margins. Again, inflation in commodity prices as well as price competition among retailers also remained headwinds.General Mills has been experiencing weak margins for the past several quarters. Adjusted gross margin declined 240 basis points (bps) to 34.4% due to higher input costs in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 220 bps to 17.4%, owing to lower adjusted gross margins, and an increase in advertising and media expenses. Adjusted gross margin declined 230 bps and adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps in the fiscal first quarter as well.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteThird-Quarter ExpectationsThe company is currently taking a number of initiatives, focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.General Mills has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Also, General Mills had earlier stated that it expects margin headwinds to subside in the second half of fiscal 2018 and generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit. Additionally, the company’s higher net price realization and benefits from its global sourcing initiative are expected to support margins in the to-be-reported quarter.However, weak sales, and higher expenses associated with promotional activities and commodities could weigh on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s margins. Despite having profound strategic plans, the company expects its adjusted operating margin to remain below the prior-year’s level in fiscal 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsOverall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.89 billion, implying 2.5% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.

125,KHC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KHC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsKraft Heinz posted fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 90 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. Also, the bottom-line declined 1.1% from the year-ago figure on higher effective tax rate.SalesReported sales of $6.88 billion fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.90 billion by 0.3%. However, the top line inched up only 0.3% year over year owing to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. The reported figure includes a favorable 0.9% impact from currency. Organically sales decreased 0.6%.Volume/mix declined 1.6% compared with a decrease of 0.2% in the previous quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as cheese and coffee in Canada.Pricing was up 1% compared with an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter driven by price improvement in Rest of World markets and the United States.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.4 billion decreased 4% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was up 4% to $2 billion in the fourth quarter owing to cost initiatives, lower overhead costs and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher input costs and lower volume/mix.Quarterly Segment DiscussionKraft Heinz reports through four segments – the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of World.United States: Net sales of $4.8 billion declined 1.1% year over year. Organic sales also fell 1.1% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 1.7% due to some distribution losses on Planters in the club channel, lower shipments in natural cheese and service-related losses in cold cuts. However, this was partially offset by higher demand in Lunchables, P3, Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, macaroni and cheese category. Pricing was up 0.6% owing to higher prices in cheese and seasonal items.Canada: Net sales of $591 million declined 4.1% year over year with a 4.5% favorable impact from currency. Organically, sales declined 8.6% as well. Volume/mix was down 8.6% on lower inventory levels at retail, the discontinuation of select cheese products and lower shipments of coffee. Meanwhile, pricing remained flat compared with the prior-year quarter.Europe: Net sales of $656 million improved 9.3% year over year with an 8.4% favorable currency impact. Organically, sales were up 0.9%. Volume/mix inched up 1.8% on robust consumption gains in condiments and sauces in Germany, Spain and France. However, pricing declined 0.9% due to changes in promotional spending in Italy, the UK and Russia.Rest of World: Net sales of $843 million increased 5.2% year over year despite a 1.8% currency headwind. Organically, sales grew 7% on 5.7% higher pricing.

126,KHC,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

127,KHC,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.P&G’s fiscal third-quarter core earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2%. The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Meanwhile, P&G agreed to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal. The addition of Merck KGaA’s differentiated as well as physician-supported brands will enhance P&G's existing consumer healthcare capabilities, and brands such as Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B. The buyout is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio and category footprint. It will also expand P&G’s geographic footprint, as Merck KGaA’s consumer health business is active in 44 countries and includes more than 900 products.Sales in DetailsP&G’s reported net sales of $16.3 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.2 billion. The top line grew 4% from the year-ago level, given strong sales from its beauty, and fabric and homecare businesses. Foreign exchange had a 4% positive impact on sales.    Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% (versus 2% growth seen in the preceding quarter) on the back of 2% increase in organic volumes. However, price had a 2% negative impact on sales.Of the five business segments, three registered positive organic sales growth. Beauty, Health Care, and Fabric & Home Care segments registered organic sales growth of 5%, 1% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments, on the other hand, registered 3% organic sales decline each.Net sales of the Beauty, Fabric & Home Care, Health Care and Grooming segments grew 10%, 6%, 5% and 2%, respectively. However, Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment’s sales remained flat in the quarter.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteMarginsCore gross margin decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 49.4%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments.Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) margin decreased 10 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 28.3%, driven by productivity savings from overhead, higher revenues, agency fee and ad production costs. Core operating margin decreased 100 bps year over year to 21.1%.Productivity cost savings contributed 310 bps of margin benefit in the quarter. P&G has been cutting costs aggressively to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 billion, down from $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 (as of Jun 30, 2017). Long-term debt was $22.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $18 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $10.7 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, up from $9.1 billion a year ago.The company returned $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders through $1.8 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchase.Earlier this month, P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe Cincinnati, OH-based company maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. However, P&G expects organic sales to be at the low end of the range. All-in sales growth is expected to be about 3%.The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6-8% (versus 5-8% expected earlier) compared with fiscal 2017 core earnings of $3.92 per share.On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to decrease 31-33% (unlike the 30-32% decrease expected earlier) versus the fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $5.59, which included a significant benefit from the Beauty Brands transaction that was completed in October 2016. The fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately 14 cents per share of non-core restructuring costs and 25 cents per share of non-core charges related to the Tax Act.P&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

128,KHC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KHC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsThe Kraft Heinz Company posted first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Higher input costs, lower sales in the United States along with higher investments to boost capabilities seemed to have adversely affected this food company’s quarterly performance. However, lower taxes and higher pricing have benefited the results.In the first quarter, the company re-aligned some of its international businesses. It formed a new reportable segment — Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), by shifting Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment to the historical Europe reportable segment. Now, the remaining AMEA operations have become the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) operating segment.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 89 cents surpassed the consensus mark of 82 cents. Also, the bottom line increased 6% from the year-ago figure on lower effective tax rate.SalesReported sales of $6.3 billion fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion by 0.7%. The top line also declined 0.3% year over year owing to soft consumer demand in North America and Rest of World. The reported figure includes a favorable 1.2% impact from currency. Organically, sales decreased 1.5%.Volume/mix declined 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as Rest of World. Nevertheless, Canada and EMEA registered solid retail growth in the quarter. Foodservice also gained in the United States and EMEA.Pricing was up 1%, same as the preceding quarter, driven by price improvement in Rest of World markets and the United States.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.2 billion increased 2.1% year over year. However, adjusted gross margin declined 20 bps from the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA was down 2.6% to $1.8 billion in the quarter due to higher input costs, lower volume/mix and more spending in strategic initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.5% decreased 70 bps year over year.Quarterly Segment DiscussionUnited States: Net sales of $4.4 billion declined 3.3% year over year. Organic sales also fell 3.3% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 4.1% due to lower shipments of nuts, cold cuts and frozen potatoes, and in parts of the cheese business. Pricing was up 0.8%.Canada: Net sales of $484 million grew 9.8% year over year owing to a 4.8% favorable impact from currency. Organically, sales were up 5% as well. Volume/mix was up 5% on higher cheese and coffee sales. Meanwhile, pricing remained flat compared with the prior-year quarter.EMEA: Net sales of $685 million improved 14.7% year over year with a 12.4% favorable currency impact. Organically, sales were up 2.3%. Volume/mix inched up 2.8% on robust consumption gains in condiments, sauces and foodservice, and also owing to a strong soup season in the U.K. However, pricing declined 0.5% due to more promotional activity in infant nutrition, primarily in Italy.Rest of World (comprising Latin America and APAC): Net sales of $767 million decreased 0.2% from the prior-year quarter due to a 3.2% currency headwind. Organically, sales grew 3% on 4.3% higher pricing. Volume/mix decreased 1.3%.FinancialsKraft Heinz ended the quarter with cash and cash investments of $1.8 billion, as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with $1.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.2018 ViewsSecond quarter is expected to face similar headwinds as seen in the first quarter, with an approximate 1.5% negative impact on volumes from Ore-Ida, Planters, and cold cuts; 1.2% from the combination of trade phasing and Easter shift; and 50 bps impact of base consumption.While second-quarter sales growth is expected to be moderate owing to the above-mentioned factors, along with the lack of a repeating inventory build in cheese and lower programming in condiments, benefits from innovation should gather momentum during the second half of 2018 with improving consumption trends.Management remains optimistic about the innovation pipeline for the back half of the year. Kraft Heinz will launch more new items in the second half of 2018 and these are also expected to “stick” better with consumers, given a more aggressive go-to-market strategy and better targeted, data-driven marketing.Overall, the company continues to expect 2018 to be a year in which just less than half of its net sales and EBITDA will be delivered in the first half of the year and more than half in the second half.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to six lower.The Kraft Heinz Company Price and Consensus  The Kraft Heinz Company Price and Consensus | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, KHC has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B.

129,KHC,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is transferring the rare disease gene therapy portfolio to private biotech Orchard Therapeutics in exchange for a 19.9% stake in the company as well as a seat on its board. In addition, Glaxo will also be entitled to royalties and commercial milestone payments related to the rare disease medicines.Glaxo’s rare disease gene therapies include marketed drug Strimvelis, a gene therapy for children with ADA-SCID which is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency, along with some pipeline candidates including late-stage programs as well as some pre-clinical ones.Glaxo announced the strategic review of the rare disease unit in last July. Back then, the company informed that it plans to terminate, partner or divest about 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs by 2020 while allocating 80% of capital to priority programs in two current areas -- Respiratory and HIV/infectious -- and two potential areas -- Oncology and Immuno-inflammation.Interestingly, at a time, when companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs, are in great demand, Glaxo is divesting the portfolio of rare disease therapies. However, Glaxo will continue to invest in cell and gene therapies with a focus on oncology.Shares of the British drugmaker have risen 16.5% this year so far against a decline of 1.7% for the industry.Last month, Glaxo announced an agreement with Swiss giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to buy the latter’s stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). (Read More: Glaxo Buys Novartis’ Stake in Consumer Healthcare JV).With the acquisition of Novartis’ 36.5% stake, Glaxo will now have 100% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare unit that includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase.Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions. Glaxo owned 63.5% share of the JV.Also, Glaxo is looking at strategic alternatives for Horlicks and other nutrition products to help fund the deal. These nutrition products are mostly sold by Glaxo’s Indian subsidiary, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo owns 72.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, which will also be included in the strategic review process. Food giants, Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever are being speculated as the frontrunners to bid for the Horlicks business.Glaxo’s latest deal with Novartis comes less than a week after it announced that it is withdrawing from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod).Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for the Consumer Healthcare segment, including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

130,KHC,"After a promising start to 2018, major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. Now, as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many, it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried-and-true strategies of Wall Street’s top figures.One of those top performers is, of course, the legendary Warren Buffett. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his decades of success, Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence. Simply put, Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) firm are icons of the investing world.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire’s legendary CEO.But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018’s early volatility unscathed, and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett, some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst-performing stocks. Let’s take a closer look.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report)Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management, calling the company’s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation. More recently, interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector. Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13% so this year, lagging the S&P 500’s nearly 2% drop.Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times, with the bank remaining one of Berkshire’s largest holdings. On top of that, Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint, missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff.The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7%, but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation.Still, earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter, indicating that the company’s fortunes could be improving. WFC is holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into its report date. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 10.9x forward 12-month earnings, which is a discount to the stock’s median Forward P/E of 12.5 displayed over the past year.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. The stock has tumbled more than 21% so far this year, and shares are hovering just above their 52-week low.These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft’s earnings outlook. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8% on net sales growth of 1%.This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one- to three-month indicator, and Kraft’s dividend yield of 4.1% is likely to keep buy-and-hold investors on board.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)Southwest was one of Berkshire’s 10-largest holdings at the end of 2017, followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). Unfortunately, industry-wide headwinds—including lower-than-expected demand for spring travel—have punished these stocks. Heading into the day, LUV was down more than 17% on a year-to-date basis.Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat, down from the previous forecast of growth between 1% and 2% from the prior-year quarter.This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest. Over the past two months, LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement among revising analysts. This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

131,KHC,"Individuals ramp up purchases of things like candies, chocolates, cologne, greeting cards along with flowers and other such gifts to pamper their loved ones on Valentine’s Day. Demand for dining out also sees an uptick.This Valentine’s Day won’t be any different. The demand for such discretionary items is likely to shoot up, largely facilitated by record wage growth and higher confidence on household income.Given the positive trends, it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally-sound companies that could make the most of Valentine’s Day.Americans to Spend Billions This Valentine’sAs per the recent annual survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights and Analytics, U.S. consumers are expected to spend a total of $19.6 billion on discretionary items this V-Day, up from $18.2 billion last year. This number will be the second-highest in the survey’s 15-year history, topped only by $19.7 billion witnessed in 2016.On average, consumers will spend $143.56, up from last year’s $136.57, as nearly 55% of the population celebrates the day. In fact, the survey shows that this year, consumers will spend an average $88.98 on spouses ($21.1 billion), $25.29 on children or parents ($3.5 billion), $7.26 on children’s classmates or teachers ($991 million), $7.19 on friends ($982 million), $4.79 on co-workers ($654 million) and $5.50 on pets ($751 million). Largely, consumers who are in the age group of 25 to 34 will be the biggest spenders, averaging $202.76.Nearly $4.7 billion will be spent on jewelry (19%), $1.9 billion on clothing (17%), $1.5 billion on gift cards/gift certificates (15%) and $2 billion on flowers (10%). But, most of the spending will come from eating out, around $3.7 billion (35%), while candy purchases will be up 55% from last year to a total of $1.8 billion. In the meantime, tickets to concerts or sporting events, better known as ‘gifts of experience’, continues to be in demand.And when it comes to shopping venues, much of it remains same as last year. Consumers planning to shop at department stores, discount stores, online, specialty stores, florists and local small business will be around 35%, 32%, 29%, 19%, 17% and 14%, respectively.Consumer Discretionary Spending on the RiseAmericans are set to splurge on discretionary items this Valentine’s Day, courtesy of fatter paychecks. Wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade, which plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending.Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74 in January. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Wages grew on a tighter labor market; tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Moreover, consumer confidence was stronger than expected in January and hovered near a 17-year high, according to the Conference Board. More the confidence households generate, the higher will be the amount they spend.5 Stocks to Gain From Valentine’s DayConsumers are expected to spend near record levels this Valentine’s Day. Thus, investing in stocks that could make the most of the spending spree seems judicious. We have selected four such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B may be a property and casualty insurance and reinsurance company, but, candies and chocolates are one of its oldest holdings. In fact, the company has a 27% stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), which is known for manufacturing Cadbury. Needless to say, Warren Buffet bought the California boxed-candy business way back in 1972, long before Berkshire Hathaway became a household name for serious investors.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 4.4% in the last 90 days. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to give a positive return of 22.9% next quarter.

The company is expected to trim freshly-cut flowers from Latin America to Miami International and then distribute them to major cities across the United States.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.

132,KHC,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31 before the opening bell.Kellogg has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, weak performance of its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U.S. snacks business has been negatively impacting the company.Kellogg, much like a number of other U.S. food producers such as General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. The company’s sales in the second half of 2017 are expected to somewhat benefit from innovation and Pringles’ improved performance in Europe. Again, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. Mexico and Australia’s sales are likely to be higher owing to better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix.As per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg’s total North America segment’s revenues are expected to witness a 0.04% decline in the third quarter. Europe revenues are likely to witness a decline of 0.01%. However, Latin America as well as Asia Pacific revenues are likely to register 0.2% and 0.03% growth in the quarter, respectively.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.However, cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to give support to its bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also expected to diminish, thereby further supporting EPS growth.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a 2.8% year-over-year decrease.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Kellogg has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.50%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

133,KHC,"Consumer products giant Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) has been focused on shaping its portfolio to achieve sustainable growth. To offer organic and healthy food products to consumers, Unilever recently agreed to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra. The terms of the transaction remain undisclosed and is subject to customary regulatory approvals.Benefits of the AcquisitionFounded in 1979, Mãe Terra offers food products under categories like organic cereals, cookies, snacks and culinary products. Per Euromonitor, the main Mãe Terra categories represent a Brazilian market worth more than 8 billion euros.The deal is a strategic fit for this European consumer products giant as the company is looking to expand in the high-growth naturals and organic segment. The company already distributes more than 120 products in Brazil and this buyout is expected to augment the company’s presence further in Brazil. Mãe Terra is also expected to get scale with Unilever’s expertise and distribution channels.Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever PLC QuoteUnilever Strengthening PortfolioNotably, the Anglo-Dutch buyer has been on an acquisition spree over the last few quarters. In fact, this is the third acquisition in a month. Last week, Unilever agreed to acquire a Seoul-based cosmetic company Carver Korea, maker of toners and moisturizers, for $2.7 billion. In September, it bought Pukka Herbs for an undisclosed amount.We note that Unilever has been trying all means to strengthen and enhance efficiency after the failed $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) in February 2017. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends as well as raise its margin target in order to boost its performance. In April, Unilever has reportedly decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Furthermore, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Stock Price MovementThe company has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying since the company rejected Kraft Heinz deal. Since Feb 17, the company’s shares have rallied 36.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.6% and the broader Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 4.1%. Unilever currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking for More?

134,KHC,"Welcome to a Super Bowl LII edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business behind the big game, looking specifically at which companies took advantage of the Super Bowl’s massive television reach.Last night, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in an epic game that wasn’t decided until the final whistle. But while the teams battled it out on the field, some of the biggest companies in the world spent millions of dollars on advertisements designed to become the talk of offices, bars, and living rooms around the country over the next few weeks.NBC’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage of Super Bowl 52 was officially brought to us by Pizza Hut YUM, Kraft KHC, U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Sprint (S  -  Free Report), Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) new Solo: A Star Wars Story movie, and a few others.On top of ads from these companies, Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) showed off multiple campaigns and sponsored halftime, where Justin Timberlake helped Nike NKE subtly sell exclusive new Jordan Brand sneakers.Some of the biggest Super Bowl ad spenders over the last 20 years, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), all poured money into ads once again.Familiar names also presented some unfamiliar messages. Peyton and Eli Manning stole a little Super Bowl spotlight, while Procter and Gamble’s PG Tide ads, featuring Stranger Things star David Harbour, might just have stolen the show.Tech giants were also some of last night’s big winners. Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) star-packed Alexa spot—which featured CEO Jeff Bezos—is sure to be seen all over the internet, social media, and television for months to come. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV sponsored NBC’s pre-game show—and might have just inspired some to cut their cords following the game.Another linear-television competitor, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), spent millions on a Super Bowl LII commercial for its Cloverfield Paradox movie, which users could watch on-demand right after the game.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

135,KHC,"The Hershey Company’s (HSY  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter 2017 and also declined from the year-ago level. Nevertheless, the company will continue to invest in core brands and focus on strategies to drive growth.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share of $1.03 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 2.8%. Earnings declined 12% from the year-ago $1.17.Net sales of $1.94 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion. Net sales declined 1.6% year over year owing to the unfavorable timing of shipments last quarter and the sales increase from the Cookie Layer Crunch launch in the prior-year quarter. The sales decline breaks the streak of six straight quarters of improvement. Organically, excluding the impact of currency, sales fell 2%.Volumes were down 2.3%. Meanwhile, net price realization had a favorable impact of 0.3% and currency drove revenues by 0.4%.Quarterly Segment DiscussionNorth America (U.S. and Canada) net sales declined 0.9% to $1.67 billion. Currency benefited sales by 0.4% and pricing had a 0.3% positive impact.

Net sales in China declined about 30% owing to volume declines.Margins DetailAdjusted gross margin declined 180 basis points (bps) to 42.7% due to unfavorable sales mix, higher freight and distribution costs, and other supply chain expenses.Cost of sales dropped 9.8% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter.

136,KHC,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 2.96%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 10 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales and volumes were down 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, and in the first nine months of 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has advanced only 0.9% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% growth.  Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q4In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.1% year over year on organic revenue growth and currency tailwinds. Revenues from emerging and developed markets increased 4.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Power Brands also witnessed a 5.6% increase in revenues.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with improved volumes in its Power Brands, which includes Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio is also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India along with strong pricing in emerging markets are added positives.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent. Again, weakness in the Middle East is also expected to hurt the company’s sales.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 36.9% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 15% growth sequentially and 4.7% year over year to $2.8 billion. North America segment, comprising about 27.7% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth from $1.77 billion in the prior quarter and $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues of $910 million indicates an increase from $908 million in the prior quarter and $864 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in eight of the past 10 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Hence, fourth-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 56 cents, reflecting a 19.2% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.98 billion, implying 3.1% growth.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

138,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Higher input costs, lower sales in the United States along with higher investments to boost capabilities seemed to have adversely affected this food company’s quarterly performance. However, lower taxes and higher pricing have benefited the results.Shares of Kraft Heinz have gained 3.9% in the after-hour trading session on May 2, following the earnings release.In the first quarter, the company re-aligned some of its international businesses. It formed a new reportable segment — Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) by shifting Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment to the historical Europe reportable segment. Now, the remaining AMEA operations became the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) operating segment.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 89 cents surpassed the consensus mark of 82 cents.

Organically, sales decreased 1.5%.Volume/mix declined 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as Rest of World. That said, Canada and EMEA registered solid retail growth in the quarter. Foodservice also gained in the United States and EMEA in the quarter.Pricing was up 1%, same as the preceding quarter, driven by price improvement in Rest of World markets and the United States.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.2 billion increased 2.1% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was down 2.7% to $1.8 billion in the quarter due to higher input costs, lower volume/mix and more spending in strategic initiatives.The Kraft Heinz Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Kraft Heinz Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteQuarterly Segment DiscussionUnited States: Net sales of $4.4 billion declined 3.3% year over year.

Meanwhile, pricing remained flat compared with the prior-year quarter.EMEA: Net sales of $685 million improved 14.7% year over year with a 12.4% favorable currency impact. Organically, sales were up 2.3%. Volume/mix inched up 2.8% on robust consumption gains in condiments, sauces, foodservice and owing to a strong soup season in the UK. However, pricing declined 0.5% due to more promotional activity in infant nutrition, primarily in Italy.Rest of World (comprising Latin America and APAC): Net sales of $767 million decreased 0.2% from the prior-year quarter due to a 3.2% currency headwind.

140,KHC,"We have crossed the halfway mark of the third-quarter earnings season, which has turned out to be pretty good. Of the notable factors influencing this season, rising momentum on the revenue front remain impressive. Moreover, the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises has been maintained in the quarter while the estimate revision trend for the December quarter remains favorable.In fact, the overall third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 index remains on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record by beating the previous earnings season’s record.Per the Earnings Preview dated Oct 27, nearly 272 S&P 500 members have already reported their results. Of these, approximately 75.7% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 66.2% beat top-line expectations. Notably, earnings for these companies have advanced 8.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 6.7%.For the third quarter as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to improve 5.4% year over year on 5.5% growth in revenues.A Look at Consumer Staples SectorCosmetics, soap & cleaning materials and food stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. Markedly, the sector is on growth trajectory since the beginning of 2017, supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.In fact, we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter. However, the Consumer Staples sector is likely to witness 2.6% and 1.9% growth in earnings and revenues, respectively. Also, a Zacks Sector Rank of #6 (out of 16), places it at the top 38% of the Zacks classified sectors. Evidently, the sector has gained 7.1% year to date, lower than the S&P 500’s growth of 15%.  Furthermore, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

Also, management has earlier pointed that competition has intensified — especially across core categories like litter and trash bags — which remains a threat to margins. (Read: Will Clorox's 2020 Strategy Help Improve Q1 Earnings?)Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteOur model does not show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29% with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Further, revenues are expected to be $1,478 million in the quarter, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. Per the analysts polled by Zacks, sales at the Cleaning segment are expected to come in at $542 million (up 1.5% year-over-year) while for Household the same is projected to be $436 million (up 3.3%). Sales at the Lifestyle segment are envisioned to be $245 million (up 1.2%) while for the International segment sales are forecasted to be $254 million (up 3.8%).Next, let’s see what’s in store for The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report), the leading manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Markedly, the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results are likely to benefit from rising consumer spending on beauty and personal grooming products, owing to improvements in consumer confidence. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has been boosting the beauty space, which bodes well for the company.

We note that the company has been witnessing top-line weakness over the past several quarters due to soft global retail and consumer demand. In fact, the food industry has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Also, consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories remain challenged. Nevertheless, Kraft Heinz expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. This is likely to be driven by strong marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives. Also, it has implemented several cost-saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz.

141,KHC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Second-Quarter 2017 ResultsKraft Heinz posted second-quarter 2017 results wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but missed the same on revenues.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 98 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 2.1%. Earnings grew 15.3% year over year on significant gains because of cost-saving initiatives.SalesReported sales of $6.68 billion fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.69 billion marginally by 0.3% and also declined 1.7% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. The company expects sales growth to ramp up in the second half of 2017. The reported figure includes an unfavorable 0.8% impact from currency.Organically (excluding currency), sales declined 0.9%.Volume/mix decreased 0.5% in the quarter against a 3.7% decline in the previous quarter. The slump was due to weak demand of cheese, meats, and food services in its biggest market, the U.S. However, these were partly offset by positive contributions from condiments and sauces in all business segments. Pricing declined 0.4% in the quarter against 1% increase in the preceding quarter.The company has been witnessing weakness in top line for the last several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, Mondelez International, Inc. and General Mills, Inc. among others, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.68 billion increased 5.9% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA (constant currency) was up 1.9% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter owing to cost cutting initiatives.Quarterly Segment DiscussionU.S.: Net sales of $4.6 billion declined 1.2% year over year. Organic sales dropped 1.2% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 0.8% in the quarter compared with 4.2% in the last quarter. Pricing was down 0.4%.The downside was primarily due to select distribution losses in cheese and meats as well as lower shipments in foodservice that overshadowed the benefits from a shift in Easter-related sales as well as gains in frozen, macaroni and cheese, and condiments and sauces.Canada: Net sales of $597 million declined 6.4% year over year despite a 3.3% favorable impact from currency. Organically, its sales declined 3.1%. Volume/mix grew 0.6%, attributable to growth in condiments and sauces that more than offset the discontinuation of select cheese products. Pricing decreased 3.7%.Europe: Net sales of $595 million declined 4.9% year over year due to 4.1% currency headwinds. Organically, sales fell 0.8% amid a challenging consumer and retail environment. Volume/mix was up 0.8% against 0.4% in the preceding quarter as robust consumption gains in condiments and sauces and gains in food service. Pricing declined 1.6%.Rest of World: Net sales of $851 million increased 1.6% year over year. Organically, sales grew 3% on higher pricing. While pricing increased 3.7%, volume/mix fell 0.7%.Outlook Skewed Toward Second Half of 2017 Kraft Heinz does not provide formal guidance. However, the company expects organic sales growth to ramp up toward the second half of 2017. This will likely be driven by stronger sales performance and cost savings that will benefit the final quarter of the year.Kraft Heinz remains on track to deliver $1.7 billion cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017. The company remains focused on defined strategy of investing, in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market capabilities as it speed up the savings and efficiencies within business.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 6% due to these changes.The Kraft Heinz Company Price and Consensus  The Kraft Heinz Company Price and Consensus | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Kraft Heinz's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it lags a lot on the momentum front with an F.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock.

142,KHC,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows. B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) also hit a new 52-week low, while Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices dip marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

143,KHC,"Shares of Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), a U.S. food and beverage company, tumbled as much as 3.6% to $40.39 in the intraday trading on Aug 30 after billionaire investor Warren Buffett crushed rumors of The Kraft Heinz Company’s (KHC  -  Free Report) interest in acquiring Mondelez.While speaking to CNBC, when asked if Kraft Heinz, in which Buffett holds a 26.7% stake, would be interested to take over the Oreos and Triscuits maker, Buffett told CNBC, “I think the answer is no on that.”Analysts have been long speculating that Kraft Heinz would pursue another acquisition after the company’s failed $143 billion bid to take over Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) earlier this year. The obvious choice was Mondelez, as it was once part of Kraft until it was spun off into a separate snack food company in 2012 to focus more on international markets.Investors should note that Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion merger proposal in February stating that that there is no financial or strategical merit in it. As a result, Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer. Initially, Kraft Heinz made clear its intentions of working out a deal for the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.Meanwhile, Mondelez has been witnessing weak volumes since 2014 because of lower demand. In fact, Mondelez has been witnessing sluggish sales results ever since it split from Kraft Foods due to global snacking category slowdown.Mondelez’s volumes were down 0.3% in 2016 and 2.1% in the first half of 2017. The company’s net revenues declined 2.8% in the first six months of 2017. Even, Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada.Mondelez and Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Another company, General Mills, Inc.’s (GIS  -  Free Report) sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.Mondelez’s shares have lost 5.5% so far this year, compared with the 9% dip of its industry. Earnings estimates moved down 1.8% for the current quarter over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz shares have lost 6.7% year to date.Zacks RankWhile Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Kraft Heinz hold a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

144,KHC,"Owing to the growing awareness of the nutritional value of food products among consumers, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) is focusing on natural and organic ingredients, reshaping its existing portfolio and foraying into other categories. Through 2017, the company has been focusing on improving in many areas, including soy sauces in Indonesia, cold cuts in United States and baby food in Canada.Also, the importance of using real ingredients and minimal processing in packaged food products is being emphasized on. As a result, a large number of companies in the food industry are switching or have already switched to the use of cage-free eggs. Kraft Heinz, which uses eggs for its line of sauces, plans to switch to 100% cage-free eggs for its North American operations by 2025.Apart from innovation, cost saving has also led to higher profits. The company expects $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion (previously 1.7 billion) of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, primarily focused on work-force reduction, factory closures and consolidations. In third-quarter 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.58 billion from its Integration Program.Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint.Though the company’s sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. While organic sales declined 1.1% in the last nine months of 2017, adjusted EBITDA rose 1.3% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points year over year. As part of these initiatives, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate the top line.ConcernsThe company is seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters owing to a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients. In the first nine months of 2017, reported net sales of $19.36 billion declined 1.4% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Three of the four reporting segments saw year-over-year declines during this period, with Canada seeing the steepest decline of 5.5%. The United States and Europe witnessed a decline of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Organically, sales declined 1.7% in the United States and 6.4% in Canada.Continued softness in sales weighed on the company’s performance, leading to an 8.9% year-to-date decline in the shares. This compares unfavorably with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. Also, the earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 remained stable over the past 30 days.  Currency fluctuations are a major headwind for Kraft Heinz, with a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Foreign exchange dented revenue growth by more than 5% in fiscal 2015 and 2.5% in 2016. It also negatively impacted net sales by 0.3% in the first three quarters of 2017.Moreover Kraft Heinz’s fourth-quarter outlook is weak with organic sales likely to face a 30-bps headwind from hurricane-related issues, delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons owing to strong fourth-quarter 2016 results. The company anticipates solid EBITDA growth to offset these challenges, reflecting its focus on boosting sales as well as cost savings.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are Flowers Foods, Inc. (FLO  -  Free Report), The Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW  -  Free Report). All the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

146,KHC,"The Q2 earnings season has so far seen releases from 41.9% of the consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 cohort. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 53.8% of the companies in the Consumer Staples sector have surpassed earnings and 61.5% have beat revenue expectations. Total earnings for these consumer staples companies increased 2.9%, while revenues declined 2.6%.Some of the key players in the sector – General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) – have already released their quarterly numbers. Hershey beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in second-quarter 2017 by 19.8% and 0.7%, respectively. General Mills’ cost-saving initiatives have helped it come up with better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results along with solid adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Total revenue however declined 3% year over year owing to lower organic sales.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report). The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases on Aug 3.Kellogg Company, the world's leading producer of cereal and convenience foods, posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.9% in the last quarter.

QuoteWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In an effort to achieve growth, the company continues with its Private Brands’ integration and revised organizational structure to focus more on organic foods. However, these initiatives are yet to yield positive results. The company incurred higher spending with regard to its business structure realignment. Unfavorable pricing, inflationary pressure, higher operating expenses also added to the concerns. Such challenges have led the company to issue a soft guidance for the second quarter, which in terms of earnings, is anticipated to be the lowest in 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 49 cents, depicting a year-over-year decline of 9.9%. Further, the analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.54 million for the said quarter, almost in line with the year-ago sales figure.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017  From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

148,KHC,"We expect Kellogg Company (KHC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 3. Last quarter, this cereal and snacks company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.95%. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.16%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Per our proven model, Kellogg has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of +2.17%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #2.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets, as well as soft U.S. snacks business, owing to lower demand.Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kellogg, like a number of other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the company expects its sales in the European business to remain soft in the second quarter due to lower volumes, tough comparisons and currency headwinds. However, strong performance in Latin America and Asia is likely to compensate for the above headwinds.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. In order to counter the sluggish sales trend, the company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation.Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales.

149,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. It isn’t unknown that seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales. Although General Mills expects fiscal second quarter to register improvement in sales, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory (Read more: Will Soft Volume Weigh on General Mills’ Q2 Sales?).Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.The company is currently taking a number of initiatives focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Buoyed on the above-mentioned initiatives, General Mills was successful in reporting higher margins until the first quarter of its fiscal 2018. Despite having profound strategic plans, General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFor the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn more favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter.The company expects its margin headwinds to subside gradually during the second half of fiscal 2018. Also, it expects to generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit.Overall, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

150,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. The food giant has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.The company’s total sales declined 3.5% in the first quarter. Organic sales declined 4%, wider than the 3% drop in the prior quarter. Price/mix did not impact quarterly revenues but volumes declined 4% in the quarter.Resultantly, General Mills’ shares have declined 9.3% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to follow the trend in the second quarter as well. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft owing to lower volumes in yogurts and cereals. At the same time, retailers are also reducing inventory, given the ongoing price war. The company’s North America Retail’s sales declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and 4.6% in the last reported quarter.Although the company expects organic sales to be better in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands will bring in improvements. As for fiscal 2018, General Mills expects its total organic sales to decline 1-2%.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s North America segment revenues, of $2.7 billion are likely to surge 9.2% sequentially but is expected to decline 0.03% year over year.Convenience Stores & Food Service segment is likely to witness 8.9% sequential growth but is expected to remain unchanged year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe & Australia segment revenues of $454 million indicates a decrease of 7.7% from the prior quarter but 0.04% growth on a year-over-year basis. Again, the consensus estimate for Asia & Latin America segment revenues of $457 million are likely to increase 16.6% sequentially and 0.04% year over year.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.1 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 7.8%. However, revenues of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company are likely to decline 1.2% year-over-year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Mills, Inc.

151,KHC,"The consumer environment looks rosy owing to favorable jobs scenario, increased consumer spending, rise in Consumer Confidence Index and an improving economy. However, shifting demographics, changing consumer preference and technology advancements continue to pose threats for the sectors where consumers’ are the main driving force.Which are the sectors that are impacted the most by this trend? Let’s find out.Well, one most prominent sector in the lot is Consumer Staples, which deals in essential and non-durable goods that form a part of our daily lives. Products ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco, and other household essentials generally make up this sector’s business. Notably, highly competitive environment, shift in preference towards organic food products, new store formats and evolving business models are major challenges plaguing the sector.Consequences of These HeadwindsWhen discussing the consequences, we can rightly quote the example of the grocery industry, which is a key segment of this sector. The industry has been grappling with intense competition, highly promotional landscape and change in customers’ taste resulting in the increased demand for organic products.As we all know, competition in the traditional grocery space mainly relates to strengthening franchises and shift to low-priced private label brands. Further, the recent intrusion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. on Aug 28 has intensified the competition. Following this, Amazon has started slashing the prices of Whole Foods’, giving its brick-and-mortar rivals goose bumps.Moreover, as quoted earlier, change in consumer tastes to healthy products has significantly altered the fate of the food industry, where the canned products and packaged goods are falling out of customers’ favor. The impact of this trend can be clearly seen in the performance of Campbell Soup Company, which is struggling to find a place in customers’ carts for its canned soup products. This is also true for other categories, including Cereal, which is also witnessing a decline.Additionally, packaged-food manufacturers are struggling to get the right promotional pacts in place with grocery retailers and other vendors. This has left them scrambling to occupy the center grocery aisle in a store. Some retailers battling for protecting shelf space are Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), and Campbell Soup.These challenges have left industry players scrambling for options to improve businesses. Apart from protecting shelf space, the food industry is feeling the pressures of some serious price wars, lower market share, diversifying products, and exploring acquisitions and mergers.Other headwinds like strained margins, high operating expenses, declining volumes, slowing emerging markets growth, uncertain international markets and foreign currency impacts may also hinder growth.How the Consumer Staples Sector is Placed?We note that the Consumer Staples sector has been underperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the sector recorded 3.2% growth, a notch below the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.2%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.While the sector Rank is encouraging, its dismal performance relative to the S&P 500 Index makes us cautious about placing bets in the sector.Earnings Trend for Sector PlayersThe second-quarter earnings season, which marked the second straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500, is well behind us.Shedding light on the Consumer Staples sector, the aforementioned challenges surely call for a tough quarterly performance for industry players. We note that many major sector participants came up with dismal earnings for the quarter and slashed their forward outlooks. Further, estimates for these companies declined considerably following the earnings.Also, as is the general case, share prices of these companies have plunged following the dismal results. These factors considerably reduce the visibility for these stocks to beat estimates in the quarter ahead.Surely, investing in companies that deliver positive surprises can fetch handsome returns for investors. On the flip side, investors prefer to sideline stocks that have a dismal surprise trend to avoid portfolio mishaps.Here is the key to any investment portfolio, picking the most lucrative stocks and doing away with stocks that have little visibility.Consumer Staples Stocks to Avoid After Earnings SlumpHence, we bring you five stocks from the Consumer Staples sector that have disappointed in the most recent quarter and witnessed decline in share price following the results. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.First on the list is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), a global direct-selling beauty company offering cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry, and accessories. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #5 and reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017. Results for the most recent quarter were primarily impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Another major setback for the company has been weak Active Representatives growth, which is hurting results for the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, estimate for the current fiscal has declined 55% to 9 cents per share in the last 60 days. Moreover, the stock declined a solid 25.9% since reporting dismal earnings on Aug 3, underperforming the industry’s 1.7% gain.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and earnings miss of 5.5% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, is also in the red. This worldwide manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters, reporting an average negative surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Much of this debacle could be attributed to a difficult packaged food industry landscape, where sales have been soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and tough retail environment. Also, the company expects a tough operating scenario in fiscal 2018, which led to a cautious view. Estimate for the current fiscal has declined 3.7% to $3.10 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 5% since reporting results on Aug 31, against the industry’s 1.1% upside.Another stock to avoid is Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States as well as a leading manufacturer of various specialty food products. The stock has declined 26.1% since posting dismal second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, wider than the industry’s fall of 23.9%. Moreover, the company has reported negative earnings surprise in four of the last five quarters, with an average four-quarter miss of 15.2%. The company has been facing a tough retailing on account of fast-evolving consumer trends. Moreover, Dean Foods’ volumes have been under pressure due to stiff competition and macro factors. These factors, along with high raw milk costs led the company to post a negative surprise of 30% in the second quarter. Estimate of 85 cents per share for full-year 2017 has declined 37% in the last 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Next is B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report), the manufacturer, seller and distributor a portfolio of shelf-stable, and frozen food and household products in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 16.3% in second-quarter 2017, mainly hurt by industry-wide challenges. Further, it lowered adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017. The company has an average negative surprise of 8.1% in the trailing four quarters. Further, estimates for 2017 dipped 1.9% to $2.12 per share in the last 30 days. This Zacks Rank #4 company has declined 3.4% since reporting second-quarter results on Aug 4, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% downside.Lastly, we would suggest avoiding Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and a negative earnings surprise of 10.9% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. The lower-than-expected results were due to lower volumes, foreign currency headwinds and soft sales at personal care and small appliances segments. This consumer products company has reported earnings miss in the last two quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.7% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, estimate for the current fiscal has fallen 0.4% to $5.57 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 14.5% since reporting earnings on Jul 27, compared with the industry’s 5.7% declineLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

152,KHC,"We expect The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after market close on Aug 3. Last quarter, this packaged food manufacturer delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.18%. However, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 8.09%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Per our proven model, Kraft Heinz has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at 97 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 96 cents resulting in an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Hence, weak consumption trends in the U.S. along with currency headwinds in Europe are likely to restrict sales growth in the near term.Nonetheless, this Pittsburgh, PA-based packaged food company’s cost-savings and restructuring initiatives have been giving a boost to the margins, thereby driving the bottom line, which is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also expects its go-to-market activity to normalize in Canada, which is likely to further support sales.That said, adverse impact of lower volumes and higher commodity costs raise concern.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 13.1% year-over-year increase. However, the consensus estimate for revenues is $6.70 billion, implying a 1.3% decline.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

154,KHC,"No one person’s commentary about the stock market commands quite as much attention as that of Warren Buffett. Of course, the “Oracle of Omaha” has certainly earned that level of respect, amassing billions of dollars over decades of meticulous investing. But this also means that when Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) reports its latest holdings, investors often move quickly to copy its recent moves.Berkshire filed its 13F for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, providing the would-be Buffetts of the world with an update on the conglomerate’s latest adjustments and giving Wall Street the closest thing to a look inside the mind of the billionaire investor that it could possibly have.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. Some of the company’s larger stakes include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of American (BAC  -  Free Report), and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).During the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s value increased about 8%, reaching a whopping $191 billion on the back of one major new addition and several position increases. Should you be following in Buffett’s footsteps by buying the same stocks? Let’s take a closer look.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by about 23% during the quarter. The technology behemoth is now the portfolio’s largest holding at 14.63% of its total value. Berkshire first purchased AAPL in Jan. 2016, and when asked to explain the move at the time, Buffet responded by simply saying, “Because I liked it.”Apple is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has been hammered by the recent market sell-off, which occurred just days after the company reported disappointing iPhone sales during the holiday quarter. Nevertheless, the stock is sporting a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and the fact that it presents such a rare value opportunity in the tech sector probably explains Buffett’s position.Shares of Apple are trading at just 15x forward earnings, coming in slightly below the market-wide average. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of 1.26, so investors are getting a decent price for its growth aspirations as well. Apple’s P/S of 3.55 is a bit stretched, but the company remains a cash cow and is generating more than $11.30 in cash per share right now, significantly outpacing its industry peers.Apple remains a strong buy-and-hold option for investors focusing on financial security and value. The firm’s dominant grip on the consumer tech industry might be slipping a bit, but Apple should remain a titan for years to come.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report)Buffett and Berkshire took the bulk of their position in BNY Mellon during the second quarter of 2012. Since then, the size of the holding has fluctuated a bit, including several small decreases in 2015 and two 50% increases in 2017. The conglomerate also upped its stake in BK by about 20% during the fourth quarter, buying a number of shares between $51 and $55.BNY Mellon has performed basically in line with the market over the past year, moving a respectable 18% higher over that time. The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall VGM grade of “D.”Investors should not expect explosive earnings growth or consistent market-beating returns from BNY Mellon. But the stock is probably a decent option for investors looking to diversify their financial holdings with a sound asset servicing company.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA  -  Free Report)Berkshire surprised many investors with the revelation that it had taken a new stake in this struggling drugmaker during the fourth quarter. Its position is relatively small and accounts for just 0.9% of the portfolio’s value, but it led many on Wall Street to question whether Buffett could see something in the stock that others were missing.The generic drug giant has faced significant headwinds lately, due in large part to lower U.S. generic drug prices and increased competition—causing management to take out massive loans to protect from its shrinking profit margins.Berkshire could be well positioned to benefit from the company’s planned turnaround, but investors should note that Teva is currently holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, the Zacks Rank is only a one-to-three month indicator, and we know that Buffett likes to buy and hold his stocks well beyond that. Teva might be risky right now, but if the company can solve its debt crisis, it could bounce back over the next few years.Want more analysis from this author?

155,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results before market opens on Friday, Feb 16, 2018.Last quarter, this packaged food manufacturer’s earrings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Overall, the company surpassed/met the consensus mark in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1.38%.A Look at Kraft Heinz’s Revenues Performance & ExpectationsThe company is seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting its categories. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) have been giving dismal performance for quite some time.In the first nine months of 2017, reported net sales of $19.36 billion declined 1.4% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the biggest decline in Canada (down 5.5%). United States and Europe registered a decline of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Organically, sales declined 1.7% in the United States and 6.4% in Canada.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, needs sustained improvement in sales for the company’s return to an overall healthy stature. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz expects organic sales growth in the United States to see a 30-basis point headwind from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading in Q3; delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts; as well as difficult year-over-year comparison owing to strong fourth-quarter 2016 results that included some degree of retail inventory build. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.8 billion reflects 1% decline from the year-ago quarter.Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $850 million are likely to witness 6.1% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $644 million indicates an increase from $600 million a year ago. Canada revenues are likely to increase to $631 million from $617 million a year ago, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kraft Heinz’s total revenues stands at $6.9 billion, implying a 0.6% year-over-year increase.Bottom-Line ExpectationTo combat weak sales environment, Kraft Heinz has implemented several cost-saving initiatives. The company had earlier aimed to cut annual costs by $1.7 billion by 2017-end, primarily through work-force reduction along with factory closures and consolidations. Cost savings have driven margins for the company, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint. As of third-quarter 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.58 billion from its Integration Program.The company anticipates solid EBITDA growth to offset the above-mentioned challenges in the fourth quarter, reflecting its ongoing focus on profitable sales, as well as cost savings.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 5.5% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is -1.57%.Zacks Rank: Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

156,KHC,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2 before the market opens.Last quarter, the Oreo-maker delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.00%. Overall, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMondelez had earlier stated that a global cyber attack, which wreaked havoc across Europe and the U.S. at the end of June, would impact its revenues in the second quarter. Additionally, the company has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it difficult for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) to boost sales.Again, foreign exchange is a major headwind for Mondelez with around 75% of its revenues coming from outside the U.S. We expect these headwinds to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, Mondelez reaffirmed its full-year organic revenue outlook of ""at least 1% growth.""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.95 billion for the second quarter, pointing at a 5.6% decline year over year.Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the company at large. These initiatives could offset the aforesaid adverse impact to some extent on the company’s sales growth in the second quarter. The company stated that its underlying margin progress continues to be in line with its outlook of mid-16% for the full year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is currently pegged at 46 cents, reflecting an increase of 3.4% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is -2.17% as the Most Accurate estimate of 45 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Mondelez’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Mondelez International, Inc.

157,KHC,"Over the past week, several of the Wall Street’s most talked about companies have posted their Q2 reports, but earnings season is far from over. Indeed, investors still have the latest reports from several tech giants and major market movers to look forward to, which means it’s more important than ever to stay tuned in.With that said, the massive amount of earnings reports coming out can be overwhelming for investors. Luckily, Zacks readers can utilize the Zacks Earnings Calendar in order to keep track of specific earnings releases, dividend announcements, and other vital news than can have a large impact on portfolios.Using the Earnings Calendar, we are looking ahead to next week to target the most important upcoming reports. Check out these four companies that are expected to release an earnings report during the week of July 31:Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, August 1 – Before Market OpenPharma giant Pfizer is set to report its second-quarter results before the bell on Tuesday. So far, the company’s large-cap pharma peers are a perfect nine-for-nine on earnings beats, although industry share prices have slumped on weak outlook. Drug stocks soared after the promise of regulatory reform, but the market has seen a bit of a pullback thanks to the administration’s relative inaction.Analyst sentiment has been mixed on Pfizer, as we’ve seen two positive and two negative revisions for to its second-quarter earnings within the past 30 days. Our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to post EPS growth of 1.95% and a revenue dip of 0.97% for the quarter. Pfizer has a strong pipeline, but genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure, and rising competition are all challenges this year.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, August 1 – After Market CloseTech behemoth Apple is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter earnings report after the closing bell Tuesday. Earnings in the consumer tech space have been strong so far, but Apple has faced new questions related to its supply chain, and with users desperately waiting for details on the iPhone 8, the company could be poised to report device sales weakness this quarter.Nevertheless, a handful of new gadgets, including the company’s wireless EarPods, did debut recently, and that could help lift sales slightly. According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Apple is expected to record EPS growth of 10.56% and revenue growth 5.55% this quarter. The stock also sports an Earnings ESP of 1.27%, and along with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), that should make investors feel more optimistic about the company’s chances to beat earnings estimates.Time Warner Inc. ) – Wednesday, August 2 – Before Market OpenCable TV leader Time Warner is set to announce its second-quarter earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday. Due to the company’s pending merger with AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Time Warner will not hold an earnings conference call, but the report will give investors an important update on the state of its business before it joins AT&T.According to the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Time Warner is poised to post revenue growth of 5.59%, but earnings are expected to slip about 7.66%. However, sentiment has improved recently, and the stock currently has an Earnings ESP of 1.68%. On top of this, positive estimate revisions have moved the company to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which should give investors more confidence heading into its earnings report date.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)) – Thursday, August 3 – After Market CloseFood giant Kraft Heinz is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. As one of the biggest food companies in the world, Kraft Heinz’s report will give us a fresh look at the latest consumer trends. Recently, a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food has hurt some of the company’s key segments.Heading into the report, just five out of nine of Kraft Heinz’s industry peers have surpassed earnings estimates this season, which underscores the challenges the industry has faced this year. So far in 2017, industry share prices have slipped more than 3%. Nevertheless, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for EPS growth of 13.11%, and given its Earnings ESP of 1.04%, it looks like the most recent sentiment has been positive.  Want more stock market analysis from this author?

158,KHC,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. DPS is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, before the market opens.Notably, Dr Pepper Snapple will be acquired by coffee-maker Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. in the second quarter of 2018.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. Moreover, Dr Pepper Snapple surpassed earnings expectations in only one of the last four quarters, the average negative surprise being 0.6%.Let us analyze a few other factors that might affect Q4 results:Sluggish carbonated beverages volume trends have been hurting carbonated beverages category growth for quite some time. Cross-category competition as well as growing health and wellness consciousness are also denting the category. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.To fight the decline in volume trends, the company is trying to diversify by introducing healthier beverage options. The acquisition of Bai Brands indicates the company’s efforts to diversify beyond carbonated soft drinks.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Packaged Beverages segment sales (accounting for more than 73% of total revenues) will rise 5.7% in the quarter. Last quarter, segment sales increased 3% on favorable product and package mix.Beverage Concentrates segment revenues were up 3% year over year in the third quarter on an increase in price and shipments of concentrate and lower discounts. In the fourth quarter, revenues will grow 3.6% year over year, per the consensus estimate.Also, Latin America Beverages segment revenues will likely be up 11.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. Revenues increased 5% in the prior quarter owing to a 2% rise in sales volumes and favorable pricing.Overall, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.77 billion, reflecting a 5.4% increase from a year ago.This apart, the company’s Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program to reduce inventory and storage costs as well as improve cash flows, looks impressive. The cash can be returned to shareholders via dividends and re-invested in the business to boost the top line.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?A look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst’s expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share declined by a cent in the past 60 days to $1.17. However, this reflects a year-over-year increase of 12.5%.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts.Dr Pepper Snapple has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is 0.04%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Dr Pepper carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the odds of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereDr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc QuoteUpcoming Peer ReleasesCampbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) are slated to report quarterly numbers on Feb 16.B&G Foods (BGS  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on Feb 27.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

159,KHC,"Kellogg Company’s (K  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassed the same. Cost-saving initiatives as well as higher contribution from the acquisitions of protein bar maker RXBAR and Brazilian food group Parati helped the company offset the industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings In LineFourth-quarter comparable earnings of 96 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line increased 5.5% year over year banking on higher operating profit and lower restructuring charges.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.21 billion, increasing 3.6% year over year. The upside can be primarily attributed to the December 2016 acquisition of Parati in Brazil and October 2017 takeover of RXBAR along with favorable currency translation. The top line outpaced the consensus mark of $3.11 billion by 3.2%.Currency and acquisitions had a 2% and 2.9% positive impact on revenues in the quarter. However, Venezuela deconsolidation had a 0.3% negative impact on the top line. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) were down 1.5% compared with a 1.4% decline in the previous quarter. Except Europe and Asia Pacific, organic sales decreased across all other regions.Volumes remained unchanged from the year ago period, a shade better than the 1.6% decrease in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, price/mix had a 1.5% adverse impact on sales against the 0.2% positive contribution last quarter.Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteProfits RiseKellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 16.8%, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points (bps) year over year. The uptick can be attributed to the benefit from strong productivity savings related to the Project K restructuring program, particularly this year's exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system.Comparable operating profit improved 5.8% year over year to $520 million in the reported quarter.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales declined 1.7% (3.3% organically) year over year to $2.1 billion due to the impacts related to the transition out of DSD in the U.S. Snacks business as well as continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business (particularly in thehealth and wellness segment). Volumes decreased 0.7% compared with a decline of 1% in the previous quarter. Price/mix was down 2.6% compared with 0.9% decline in the prior quarter. Adjusted (comparable) operating profit also slipped 0.8% in the segment.Europe: Segment revenues of $614 million improved 10.4% and currency had a 7.4% positive impact on the same. Organically, sales were up 3% in the fourth quarter compared with 0.1% growth last quarter. Adjusted operating profit improved 0.8% as well.Latin America: Segment revenues of $259 million improved 38.1% (organically, revenues were up 0.5%). However, price/mix and volume had a 0.1% and 0.4% negative impact on sales while currency had a 2.4% positive impact. Acquisitions also had a 32.9% positive impact on revenues. Adjusted operating profit grew 0.9% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: Segment revenues of $243 million improved 8.1% on the back of strong growth across the region for both cereal and snacks. Organically, sales increased 4.3%, better than 2.9% growth in the previous quarter. While volumes increased 4.4%, price/mix had a negative impact of 0.1% on sales. Adjusted operating profit improved 9.9% in the Asia Pacific.2018 ViewsKellogg’s expects revenues to remain flat on a currency-neutral basis for 2018. It also anticipates adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 9-11% on constant currency.Adjusted constant-currency operating profit growth is projected in the range of 4-6%. Cash from operating activities is expected to increase in the band of $1.7-1.8 billion for 2018 driven by higher net income, sustained working-capital improvement and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

160,KHC,"With a significant portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, Mondelez International, Inc.’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) international markets have contributed significantly to growth. The company generated about 73.2% of revenues from outside the United States in 2016 and 73.6% in the first nine months of 2017.The emerging markets of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia offer solid long-term prospects. The company’s organic revenues from emerging markets increased 2.7% in 2016 as well as in the first nine months of 2017. Mondelez is building new plants and expanding existing ones in China — one of the key emerging markets.Another key market for Mondelez is India where its business is run by Cadbury India Ltd. The company has seen strong growth in the country in the past few quarters. India revenues grew double digits in the third quarter of 2017 owing to the ongoing momentum in products like Fuse and Silk Oreo.In Brazil, improving dynamics in chocolate resulted in a fourth straight quarter of growth. Overall, Brazil revenues were up low single digits in the third quarter. Mexico continued to deliver solid growth, driven by strength in candy while growth in Argentina was led by pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.We believe emerging markets with continue to enhance Mondelez’s prospects at a time when the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption due to a shift in consumer preference toward organic food items. Food companies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, have also been struggling to boost sales over the last few years. Revenues from North America were down 1.2% in the first nine months of 2017 and overall sales declined 1.2% over the same time frame.Though overall sales have been sluggish, Mondelez's margins have been consistently strong buoyed by cost savings and productivity gains.  Operating margin expanded 330 basis points year over year, in the first nine months of 2017.The company’s $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018. Operating margin is expected to scale to 17-18% by next year. Savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and spending in lower-cost digital media outlets.Stock Price MovementThough Mondelez’s shares have lost 4.5% so far this year, it compares favorably with the 8.2% decline of its industry. Earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 increased 0.9% each, over the last 30 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 2.96%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

163,KHC,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The company has been witnessing top-line weakness over the last couple of years, primarily due to lower demand in North America. The food industry in the region is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about 68% of Kellogg’s total revenues. Hence it is evident that the revenue generated from this segment largely impacts the overall revenues of the company. The segment is further categorized into U.S. Morning Foods, U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty and North America Other.In the prior quarter, Kellogg’s total North America sales declined 1.6% year over year to $2.18 billion, owing to the exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal in traditional retail channels. Moreover, in the first nine months of 2017, sales declined 2.8% from the prior-year period. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at $2.06 billion, implying a 3.2% decline.North America Business by SegmentU.S. Morning Foods:  Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, which accounts for 40-45% of sales, has been performing poorly for quite some time now. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. In the prior quarter, revenues slipped 3% and declined 5.3% in the first nine months. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to decline 3.4% per the consensus estimate.U.S. Snacks: This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes. In the prior quarter, sales declined 4.5% from the year-ago level due to reduced merchandising and SKU rationalization. Also, in the first nine months of 2017, the segment’s net sales dropped 3.6% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to decline 8.1% per the consensus estimate.U.S. Specialty: This segment’s sales rose 1.9% in the prior quarter, marking the ninth straight quarter of sales growth, given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels, such as K-12 schools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Specialty segment revenues is pegged at $286 million, implying a 1.1% increase.North America Other: Segmental revenues grew 4.4% in the prior quarter on contribution from frozen foods. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 3.2% per the consensus estimate.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.11 billion indicates a 0.4% uptick on a year-over-year basis. In the first nine months of 2017, net sales declined 2% (down 3.4% organically) with volumes down 4.1% as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period.Kellogg Company Revenue (TTM)  Kellogg Company Revenue (TTM) | Kellogg Company Quote Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Earnings increased 9.4% year over year in the prior quarter and surpassed the consensus estimate by 12.9%. Also, Kellogg’s surpassed earnings in all of the past four quarter, the average beat being 7.9%.

164,KHC,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8 before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.9%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.88%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Kellogg has missed analysts’ expectations on sales in five of the past 10 quarters. The company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last couple of years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business has been affecting the company.Segment Discussion: Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg’s Total North America segment’s revenues (comprising 68% of the Kellogg’s total revenues) are expected to witness a 3.2% decline in the fourth quarter. Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business has been performing poorly since 2012 due to disappointing category growth. Precisely, its adult category has been a drag, adversely impacting its overall sales growth.Revenues at the U.S. Morning Foods segment including cereals dipped 5.3% in the first nine months of 2017. The metric at the U.S. Morning Foods segment is also anticipated to decline 3.4% in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, the U.S. snacks business has been struggling since 2013 on low volumes. Kellogg’s transition from a Direct Store Delivery system to warehouse distribution in its U.S. Snacking business is on track with shipping fully transitioned to warehouses in July 2017. This shift remains a headwind to sales of late as the company rationalizes SKUs and resets pricing to customers. The U.S. snacks business revenues are estimated to decline 8.1% year over year to $705 million in the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. It is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities plus product and packaging innovation. Again, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. The metric is also predicted to gain from the improved performance of Pringles in Europe.Europe revenues are likely to witness a 2.7% decline. However, Latin America as well as Asia Pacific revenues are expected to register a respective 20.9% and 3.6% rise in the quarter.Kellogg, much like a number of other U.S. food producers namely General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been struggling due to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the soon-to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017, declining 3% from the level in 2016 on a currency-neutral comparable basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.1 billion, implying 0.4% growth.Let as delve deeper into other factors likely to impact Kellogg’s fourth-quarter performance:Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline. Although the top line has been discouraging, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to lend support to the company’s bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also likely to subside, further supporting EPS growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company Quote Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Kellogg does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

165,KHC,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.97%.The chocolate maker surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderChanges in consumer preference and consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products have been a dampener for Hershey’s sales since 2014.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after a few quarters of no growth.Given this changing scenario, we expect Hershey to see modest sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier expressed that given the timing of Easter and the expected lower sales in China, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to be lower than full-year growth rate. For 2017, net sales are expected to be at the low end of the previously stated range of 2–3%.To counter the soft sales environment, major food companies like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), and The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) have been relying on productivity savings to boost its bottom line. Hershey too is banking on restructuring initiatives, which will likely help the company increase its EPS despite weak sales growth.Hershey’s adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) and 170 bps, respectively, in the first quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, Hershey will likely register higher quarterly EPS depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hershey is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.30%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 91 cents.Zacks Rank: Hershey currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

166,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) outlined four key global strategies for fiscal 2018 at the company's annual Investor Day meet on Jul 12.The North American food industry is experiencing changes in consumer preferences as consumers are increasingly gaining faith in organic and healthy food items. This is upsetting the consumer value equation, thus creating challenges for the food industry. This seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, thus making it harder for legacy brands to boost sales.General Mills’ shares have lost around 13.5% year to date, compared to the 7.5% decline of the Zacks categorized Food-Miscellaneous/Diversified industry. Estimates for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock have moved down for the current and the next year over the last 30 days.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.With evolving consumer food preferences, General Mills prioritizes consumer-focused innovation and marketing and also focuses on natural and organic product portfolio to boost sales.Key PrioritiesThe company plans to focus more on growing its cereal business, which has been sluggish for quite sometime now. Cereal sales declined 2.1% in fiscal 2017.and 1% in fiscal 2016In order to counter this, General Mills has made 75% of its cereals free of any artificial flavors and colors. The company is committed toward removing these ingredients from its entire cereals range. Further, General Mills plans to introduce new varieties of its ""Toast Crunch"" line, Blueberry Chex and Banana Nut Cheerios across U.S. brands.  Also, products like Nesquik and Cheerios all-family granolas will be added to the global product portfolio along with expansion of the Lion Wild brand.General Mills is restructuring its U.S. yogurt portfolio through fundamental innovation. It is renovating its core Yoplait and Go-Gurt products, expanding its organic presence with Annie's and Liberté, and developing a new yogurt segment. Yogurt sales declined 12.9% in fiscal 2017 while  it dropped 6% in fiscal 2016,  . Such initiatives are expected to help the yogurt business make a turnaround.The company’s third main strategy focuses on driving differential growth across several global platforms where it has already seen solid revenue (roughly $4 billion) momentum. They are Häagen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars (primarily under Nature Valley), Fiber 1 and Larabar brands, Old El Paso Mexican foods and its natural and organic brands in North America.Investing in its Foundation businesses (includes refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes etc.) is also a key priority for fiscal 2018. The company will be launching a line of organic soups under the Progresso brand and two new varieties of Pillsbury pizza dough.Apart from these four key priorities, the company is focused on improving its e-commerce channel as CEO Harmening is of the view that “the most significant change that will impact the next five years will be in how consumers get their food, driven by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce.”E-commerce already represents about 1.5% of the company's total sales in the U.S. in fiscal 2017 and this is expected to grow 5% by fiscal 2020. The company also expects double-digit growth for its global e-commerce business, led by the U.S, going forward.Consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings will likely make up for the sluggish revenue growth at General Mills.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The bottom line increased 10% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 6%.

Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on sales.    Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 2% on the back of a 2% increase in organic volumes. However, price had a 1% negative impact on sales.Of the five business segments, three registered positive organic sales growth.

However, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments witnessed 1% revenue decline each in the quarter.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteMarginsCore gross margin decreased 80 basis points (bps) to 50.7%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments.Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) margin decreased 80 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 27.2% driven by productivity savings from overhead, higher revenues, agency fee and ad production costs. Core operating margin decreased 10 bps year over year to 23%.Productivity cost savings contributed 190 bps of margin benefit in the quarter. P&G has been cutting costs aggressively to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $7.4 billion, up from $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 (as of Jun 30, 2017).

All-in sales growth is expected to about 3%.The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 5-8% (versus 5-7% expected earlier) compared with fiscal 2017 core earnings of $3.92 per share. The upbeat view primarily reflects the potential benefit from the Tax Act.On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to decrease 30% to 32% (as against 26% to 28% decrease expected earlier) against fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $5.59, which included a significant benefit from the Beauty Brands transaction that was completed in October 2016. The fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately 10 cents per share of non-core restructuring costs and 24 cents per share of non-core charges related to the Tax Act.P&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

168,KHC,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Cost-saving initiatives as well as higher demand for its frozen foods and Kashi snacks helped the company offset the industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings BeatThird-quarter comparable earnings of $1.05 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents by 12.9%. Earnings increased 9.4% year over year banking on higher operating profit that offset a higher tax rate.Adjusted earnings exclude costs associated with a mark-to-market loss and certain other items. Including these items, however, the company reported earnings of 85 cents per share, higher than the year-ago earnings of 82 cents.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.27 billion, increasing 0.6% year over year after several quarters of revenue decline. The upside can be primarily attributed to the December 2016 acquisition of Parati in Brazil, as well as favorable currency translation. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion by 1.8%.Currency had a 0.6% positive impact on sales in the quarter. Acquisitions also had a 1.6% positive impact on revenues. However, Venezuela deconsolidation had a 0.2% negative impact on the top line.

169,KHC,"Moving ahead with its portfolio restructuring strategy for long-term growth, Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to offload its global Spreads business to KKR (KKR  -  Free Report). Incidentally, the provider of personal care products, which was looking for buyers for its spreads unit, received a binding proposal from KKR to buy the shrinking business. Expected to close in mid-2018, the cash-free and debt-free deal is worth roughly €6.825 billion.Sources revealed that Unilever’s spreads business has been sluggish for a while now due to consumers’ preferences moving from bread and margarine to more natural foods. While Unilever has been taking initiatives to improve the business, management believes that its Spreads business is likely to reach its full potential under KKR’s ownership.In fact, industry experts also believe that funds like these can run such business segments more efficiently, by doing away with underperforming parts and accelerating growth via other game plans. Thus, sale of the Spreads business to KKR is likely to support growth of this segment, given the global investment firm’s robust network and operational excellence.The transaction, which will include sale of brands like Becel, Flora, Blue Band, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter and more, remains subject to regulatory approval. Further, Unilever plans to use the cash generated from this deal in making shareholder-friendly moves, or to carry out other buyouts.What Has Been Driving Unilever’s Strategic Moves?Unilever has been focusing on bolstering and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) earlier this year. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders and enhance margins to boost performance. In this regard, Unilever had decided to offload its shrinking spreads business in April, when it also announced plans to raise cost-savings target and combine foods and refreshments businesses.Clearly, the aforementioned sale to KKR marks a solid step in achieving these goals. As part of strengthening its portfolio, the company has also remained keen on making strategic buyouts. This is evident from Unilever’s agreement to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mae Terra in October, which complements the company’s efforts to expand in the high-growth natural and organic segment.Apart from natural foods, Unilever is also making aggressive attempts to nourish its beauty and wellness products portfolio. Evidently, the company inked a deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals last week, which is likely be a valuable inclusion in the company’s Personal Care Business. Prior to that, in November, the company agreed to acquire leading skincare and haircare brand Sundial Brands and cosmetics company Carver Korea in September. Unilever’s robust efforts to reshape its portfolio have been appeasing investors, as reflected by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s impressive past performance. Well, shares of this consumer products giant have surged 40.7% this year, crushing the industry’s rally of 21.3%. We believe that prudent endeavors like the aforementioned sale of the Spreads unit, is likely to drive further growth for Unilever.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

170,KHC,"Progressing with expansion of natural products portfolio, Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) inked a deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals. Headquartered in Oregon, Schmidt’s specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Management expects Schmidt’s brands to compliment Unilever’s diverse natural products portfolio and prove to be a valuable inclusion in the company’s Personal Care Business.Schmidt’s commands a strong portfolio of natural brands and has been delivering sturdy growth in the fast-paced natural products industry, courtesy of the company’s dedication toward innovation. In fact, Schmidt’s deodorants are popular for its award-winning formulas, extracted mainly from minerals and plants. While the transaction is likely to benefit Unilever, Schmidt’s products are also expected to gain from wide-spread sales channels in key global markets.The terms of the agreement have been kept discreet by the companies. Further, the contract is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.Other Acquisitions Driving the Stock  Unilever has been advancing well in the natural and organic products category, gaining from consumers increasing preference for such products. Rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products. The recent deal with Schmidt’s is thus expected to further strengthen Unilever’s position in this category.Apart from adding natural products brands in the beauty and wellness category, Unilever has also been fortifying organic foods portfolio. Evidently, Unilever entered into an agreement to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra in October.Notably, Unilever has been focusing on bolstering and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) earlier this year. Since then, the company has been undertaking several initiatives to improve performance.To this end, this consumer products giant has been on an acquisition spree in the last few months, to bolster foothold in the beauty arena. In November, the company agreed to acquire New York-based Sundial Brands, a leading skincare and haircare brand. It also clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros in September. Incidentally, the beauty category has been witnessing high growth, on the back of social media content and diverse professional make-up techniques. Investors are optimistic about Unilever’s consistent efforts to tap into prospective business areas and seize opportunities therein.

171,KHC,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, after market close on Nov 1. Last quarter, this packaged food manufacturer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08%. Also, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 3.68%. The chart below depicts the surprise history. The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise   The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company Quote The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters due to soft global retail and consumer demand. In the first half of 2017, reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) have been performing dismally for quite some time. Consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories remain challenged. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the steepest decline in Canada (down 8.9%) and Europe (down 5.8%). Its flagship U.S. segment saw a 2.3% year-over-year decline in net sales. The company’s overall organic sales also declined 1.8% during the period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, the company expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. This will likely be driven by strong marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives.  Kraft Heinz has implemented several cost-saving initiatives, including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz. The company plans to cut annual costs by $1.7 billion by 2017-end, primarily through work-force reduction along with factory closures and consolidations. Cost savings have driven margins for the company, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint. However, adverse impact of lower volumes, higher commodity costs and foreign exchange headwind could hurt profits in the to-be-reported quarter. Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting a 0.3% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $6.3 billion, implying a 0.9% increase. Here is what our quantitative model predicts: Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is +0.56%.

172,KHC,"Shares of major packaged food companies have been trading lower since June as investors fear that Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billion buyout of the organic grocer Whole Foods Market, Inc.  would make a seismic shift for retailers.Shares of a number of grocery store chains, including The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), dipped on Aug 28, after the deal officially came into effect. The deal was announced in mid-June. Losses spread across the food sector and shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Post Holdings Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) tumbled as well.Traditional packaged food brands such as General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg and Conagra are already struggling, as consumers look for fresh foods and more natural brands over packaged and processed food.Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. For Kellogg, net sales declined 3.3% year over year due to foreign currency headwind and weak volume (down 5.3%) as a result of unexpectedly soft consumption trends across most categories during the period. General Mills' sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.That said, these major packaged food companies have been fighting the sales slump with consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings.For General Mills, adjusted gross margin advanced 50 basis points or bps and adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps in fiscal 2017. Again, cost savings from its Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) have been supporting renovation, innovation, brand support and margins for Kellogg. Kraft Heinz realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.45 billion from its Integration Program as of second-quarter 2017.Amazon's foray into brick-and-mortar stores is now likely to step up fresh price wars for these companies’ products, both in stores and online. Amazon’s as much as 43% price cut on Whole Foods’ products on its first day as the owner of this organic grocer could be distressing for the entire food industry. Prices of a number of products, ranging from avocados to organic chicken, were cut.Bottom LineDespite traditional packaged food companies taking a number of initiatives to boost sales, the weakness in this area continues. Amid this uproar, how these food biggies deal with the latest Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a wait-and-see story.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

174,KHC,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30 after market close.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to lower demand.Mondelez’s sales were down 2.8% on a 2.1% decline in volumes in the first half of 2017. Organically, sales decreased 1% in the period. However, the company expects its sales to rebound in the second half delivering companywide organic sales growth of 1% for 2017. The company’s third-quarter volumes are expected to get a boost owing to delayed shipments after the cyberattack in the preceding quarter. The company’s shipping process was affected due to the global malware attack. That said, the company expects to recognize and recover delayed shipments during the third quarter that would result in higher volumes.Mondelez’s North America segment, comprising about 26% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the third quarter after registering a 5% year-over-year decline in revenues in the first half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company has a strong innovation agenda in North America for the second half of 2017. Mondelez has several new products in the pipeline to boost North American sales. These include new Vea brand snacks, non-GMO Triscuits, Belvita Protein, Ritz Crisp & Thins, and Good Thins.Europe revenues are likely to witness 12.4% growth. The consensus estimate for Latin America revenues of $911 million indicates an increase of 5% from the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in seven of the past nine quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has also been able to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.Mondelez’s third-quarter margins are expected to gain from higher volumes as well as lower overhead and advertising costs. Again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, higher pricing and restructuring are expected to boost its margin. Mondelez anticipates adjusted earnings to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis for 2017 and remains on track to reach its 17-18% profit-margin goal by 2018.For the third quarter, Mondelez’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting a 3.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.5 billion, implying 1.2% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.84%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

179,KHC,"Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) recently confirmed the buyback of its outstanding Dutch preference shares, through a public offer worth 450 million euros. The company is aiming to simplify its corporate structure through this buyback initiative. The public offering is in connection with Unilever’s agreement to purchase 6% and 7% preference shares in Unilever N.V. held by NN Investment Partners and insurer ASR Netherlands. The offer, which initiated on Oct 11, 2017, will cease on Oct 25.Simplifying the Corporate Structure The company has been considering corporate restructuring for its dual-headed legal structure, to make it more agile. To this respect, the purchase of 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares holdings of the company’s Dutch-listed entity, Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), is a radical step. As the consumer products giant is listed both in Amsterdam and London, the move will aid the company to improve corporate governance. The review of Unilever N.V.’s corporate structure is expected to be completed by the end of this year.Other Initiatives to Boost Performance Unilever has been focusing on strengthening and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co (KHC  -  Free Report). Since then, the company has been undertaking several initiatives to boost shareholder returns and raise its margin target in order to improve performance.Acquisitions have also been an important growth driver for Unilever. Unilever recently agreed to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra. It also clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros in September. The buyout will place the company in the beauty category which has been witnessing high growth, driven by social media content and diversified professional make-up techniques. Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc (EL  -  Free Report) have also been growing significantly, on the back of rising demand for beauty products.Unilever has been considering moving out of slow-growing business areas. In April, Unilever decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Further, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses. It also announced the buyout of the Australian ice cream brand Weis.Investors remain impressed with Unilever’s ongoing initiatives to streamline its business through buybacks, consolidations and acquisitions. Evidently, shares of the company have returned 15.7% in the past 6 months, compared with the industry’s rise of 5.6%.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company currently carries a VGM Score of A, indicating its inherent strength. You can see see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

180,KHC,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) — a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer food.Sales have been soft due to lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences. Sales at the North America Retail segment, accounting for 65.3% of sales in fiscal 2017, decreased 6.8% affected by declines in the U.S. Meals & Baking, U.S. Yogurt, U.S. Cereal, and Canada operating units. Volumes at the North America Retail segment dropped 11% owing to deterioration in the developed markets of North America, Europe and Australia. Like other U.S. food producers — Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — General Mills has been facing the brunt of the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Notably, shares of the company have lost 19.2% in the last one year, compared with the industry’s ’s decline of 9.6%. In the last 60 days, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.5% and 1.8% for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.Efforts to Counter Tepid SalesTo combat the weak sales, General Mills has outlined four key global strategies for fiscal 2018. The company plans to focus more on growing its cereal business which has been sluggish for quite some time now. Cereal sales nonetheless declined around 1% in fiscal 2016 and 3% in fiscal 2017.Also, restructuring its U.S. yogurt portfolio through fundamental innovation is a key objective as the unit has been experiencing sluggish sales over the last few quarters, declining 18% in fiscal 2017. The company’s third main strategy focuses on driving differential growth across several global platforms where it has already witnessed solid revenue momentum. Investing in its Foundation businesses (includes refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes etc.) is also a priority for fiscal 2018.Apart from these strategies, consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings are making up for the sluggish revenue growth at General Mills. The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales.Also, by fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. The company plans on delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which is expected to rake in approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The Road AheadDespite the several initiatives undertaken to boost sales, General Mills expects organic sales decline of 1%-2% year over year. The company expects earnings in the first half of fiscal 2018 to decline on lower sales, phasing of its cost savings initiatives and brand investments. However, management anticipates earnings for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to improve in the second half as sales pick up pace.

181,KHC,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, known for its consumer packaged food and beverages.Although Kraft Heinz’s shares have performed better than the industry year to date, estimates have been trending downward for 2017 and 2018 over the last 90 days. While the industry witnessed a decline of 6.3%, the company’s lost 3.3% during the same time frame. A shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food hurt the company’s top line. Meanwhile, the company has been undertaking several sales driving actions in 2017, like cost saving and productivity gain, in order to deal with the challenging macro environment.Key Sales DriversThe company’s outlook for the second half of 2017 is focused on the strategy of investing, innovation, marketing and go-to-market capabilities as it drives savings and efficiencies.Kraft Heinz has implemented many cost-saving initiatives, including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz. The company plans to save $1.7 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017, primarily focused on work-force reductions along with factory closures and consolidations. As of second-quarter 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.45 billion from its Integration Program.Among the other productivity improvement initiatives, programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint and building a performance driven culture in the company were undertaken.Though the company’s sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reported an organic net sale decline of nearly 1% while adjusted EBIDTA grew nearly 2%. As part of these initiatives, savings are being re-invested in innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth. The company is also working for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both food services and international channels.With growing awareness of the nutritional value of food products and a subsequent shift in consumer preference toward organic product over packaged items, Kraft Heinz, like many other companies in the industry, plans to switch to 100% cage-free eggs for its North American operations by 2025.In 2017, the Kraft Heinz is focused on improving the performance of three key brands — Heinz, Kraft and Planters — and five global product categories, which are condiments and sauces, cheese, meals, nuts and baby food.ChallengesHowever, the company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Kraft Heinz’ categories have slowed down due to soft global retail and consumer demand. Consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories like ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and salad dressings remain challenged.In the first half of 2017, reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the steepest decline in Canada (down 8.9%) and Europe (down 5.8%). Its flagship U.S. segment saw a 2.3% year-over-year net sales decline. The company’s overall organic sales also declined 1.8% during the period.Kraft Heinz’s developed markets – United States and Europe – saw negative organic sales growth. The company is witnessing lower volumes and share losses in the United States due to weak category trends.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKraft Heinz currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in this sector are Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) and Ingredion Incorporated (INGR  -  Free Report). While Post Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chefs' Warehouse and Ingredion carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

182,KHC,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500.

184,KHC,"In an attempt to simplify its capital structure, Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) is apparently considering to buyback around $520 million preference shares from Dutch institutional investors.  As the consumer products giant is listed both in Amsterdam and London the move is likely to help the company improve corporate governance.Per sources, Unilever has agreed to buy the 6% and 7% preference shares in Unilever N.V. held by NN Investment Partners and insurer ASR Netherlands. It will launch a public offering for the shares, which will value the outstanding 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares at €450 million ($528 million).The offering is expected in the third quarter of this year and is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter. After the completion, Unilever intends to acquire the remaining preference shares and to terminate the listings on Euronext Amsterdam.Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever PLC QuoteThe need to simplify the company’s capital structure rose when shareholders compelled Unilever to review its business structure after the Anglo-Dutch company rejected a $143 billion takeover bid by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017. The maker of Dove products and Ben & Jerry then undertook a business review to strengthen its position in a world of mergers and acquisitions and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.In this regard, Unilever has divested its underperforming businesses and has reportedly decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter, in April. Unilever also plans to integrate its food and refreshment businesses into a Netherlands-based unit. Furthermore, the company has announced hike in dividends (by 11% in June), raised cost savings target through its Connected 4 Growth (C4G) program announced last year. The program was undertaken to reduce costs, under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over. This has generated savings of more than €1 billion in the first half of year 2017, which is a step closer towards its target of €6 billion and a targeted underlying operating margin of 20% by 2020. Moreover, it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA, which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders.The company expects these actions to deliver underlying sales growth in the 3–5% range in 2017. The company anticipates accelerating growth in the second half of the year driven by the phasing of the innovation plans and a step-up in brand and marketing investment.Meanwhile, Unilever continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia. Further, the company is witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe. Additionally, it has been delivering weak results for the past few quarters due to sluggishness in the emerging markets, which account for about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. Though the emerging markets offer robust long-term prospects, they are generally volatile.Stock Price MovementA glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows the company’s shares have moved up 37.8% over the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 14.2% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 8% of the Zacks Classified industries (20 out of the 265).Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderUnilever currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we believe there is still much value left in the stock, which is quite evident from its VGM Score of ‘’A’’.Investors interested in the same space may consider some better-ranked stocks like Inter Parfums, Inc.

186,KHC,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been implementing cost saving initiatives, investing in consumer-focused innovation and accelerating the natural and organic product portfolio to boost its sales keeping the changing food preferences in mind.Earlier this month, the company posted weak first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5% and 7.8%, respectively.ChallengesMajor U.S. food companies are fighting a tough battle as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience foods are gradually losing sheen. Consumers would earlier take decisions based on taste, price and convenience.This seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), and others, thus making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales.In the recently reported quarter, General Mills’ adjusted earnings and revenues declined 9% and 3.5%, respectively, year over year due to weak sales across the board, barring Convenience Stores & Foodservice, and Europe & Australia segments. Its core U.S. Retail business’ sales declined 5% primarily due to double-digit declines in the domestic yogurt operating unit and a 7% decline in cereals. The company’s organic sales also declined 4%, with volumes decreasing 4%.The company also revealed a weak margin picture with adjusted gross margin declining 230 basis points (bps) due to higher input costs. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 210 bps thanks to lower adjusted gross margins and an increase in advertising and media expense.Again, fiscal 2018 guidance seems to be a shade depressing, depicting organic sales decline of 1% to 2%, segment operating profit growth of 0% to 1% (restructuring savings partly offsetting higher investments), and earnings per share growth of 1% to 2%.Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing. However, a material improvement in the segment will take some time.Turnaround EffortsTo regain lost ground, General Mills laid out four global growth priorities for improving its top line. Growing Cereal globally, improving U.S. yogurt through innovation, investing in differential growth opportunities and managing the company’s foundation brands with appropriate investment are the key agendas. Precisely, expanding the Cereal business includes Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), which is the joint venture with Nestlé based in Switzerland that markets cereal in 130 countries.The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales in a challenging and dynamic environment.Furthermore, General Mills is on track to achieve its cost-savings target for fiscal 2018 as it forges ahead with its margin-expansion efforts. The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equate to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The company remains optimistic about the rest of fiscal 2018 and expects retail sales to contribute positively, beginning second quarter. Although, we do not expect significant sales growth in the near term, the declines are expected to narrow down as the company focuses more on sales growth, banking on product innovations. Hence, sales are likely to strengthen and margin headwinds to diminish as we move forward through the fiscal year, driving profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

187,KHC,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013.

With the improvement in the U.S. economy, shoppers have started spending on beauty and personal care products as well as apparel, footwear and personal accessories apart from buying essential and non-durable goods. The rise of e-commerce and social media has provided a further impetus to the fast-growing beauty channels. In such a scenario, many companies are looking for opportunities to strengthen their footholds in the fast-growing beauty segment. Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) is no exception. This global consumer products giant recently clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros ($2.71 billion) from Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital and Carver's founder. Bain and Goldman jointly held 60.39% of Carver at the end of 2016, while its founder Lee Sang-rok held a 35% stake. Carver generated sales of 321 million euros ($381 million) with core profit of 137 million euros in 2016.Acquisition Benefits for UnileverNotably, the Anglo-Dutch company has been striking many skincare and cosmetics deals in the past to expand its footprint in the global beauty business as well as move away from its slower-growth food segment. Carver will join brands including Hourglass, Murad, Kate Somerville and REN in Unilever’s Prestige division.The acquisition is likely to provide ample growth opportunities to Unilever in both North and South Korea, despite geopolitical tensions between China and Korea related to the missile tests and China’s banning of tour packages to South Korea.

Unilever will be able poised for growth in the skincare business in South Korea through its AHC brand of anti-ageing creams, moisturizers and other skin products. Unilever will also have access to North Asia’s skincare market, where Carver has significant presence. With this acquisition, Unilever will expand in the fourth-largest skincare market, as per reports.The buyout will also place the company in the beauty category which has been witnessing high growth, driven by social media content and diversified professional make-up techniques. Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) are growing significantly courtesy of rising demand for beauty products. We expect the acquisition to strengthen Unilever’s portfolio and generate substantial revenues.We note that Unilever has been trying all means to become more reliant on bath, body and beauty products after the unexpected $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) in February 2017. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends as well as raise its margin target in order to boost its performance. In April, Unilever has reportedly decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Furthermore, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever PLC QuoteStock Price MovementThe company has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying since the company rejected Kraft Heinz deal.

189,KHC,"Unilever (UN  -  Free Report) is in the midst of a strong run that has seen its shares skyrocket to a new all-time high. New highs can sometimes cause investors to hesitate because they assume a stock will settle down, but our Zacks Style Scores can help investors find stocks that are still poised to grow, even as they sit near their historical peaks.Almost any investor could benefit by sticking to stocks with strong Zacks Ranks and high grades in our Style Scores systems. But for growth investors, it takes much more than simply looking for stocks with the highest growth rates. Understanding and evaluating quality is essential as well.This is where the Growth category of the Style Scores system comes into play. This category not only analyzes the growth prospects of a company, but also evaluates its corporate financial statements.Studies have shown that stocks exhibiting the best growth characteristics consistently outperform the market, and if investors add a strong Zacks Rank on top of those growth fundamentals, the returns are even better.With that said, let’s take a look at Unilever, a high Zacks Rank stock that also grades out well in terms of Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report) Shares of the Anglo-Dutch consumer packaged goods giant, which owns brands such as Dove, Lipton, Ben & Jerry’s, Degree Deodorant, and many more, started to soar after a $143 billion merger attempt from Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) failed to go through.Since then, Unilever’s stock price has shot up 47.59% year-to-date and now rests just below its all-time high of $60.81 per share, which it hit on Sept. 11.Unilever has flexed its muscles since the merger failed. The company posted a 22% increase in net profits during the first half of its fiscal year, and it has begun to bolster its brand portfolio by adding companies such as British-based organic tea maker Pukka Herbs, which helps Unilever as consumers look for more eco-friendly and healthy options.The London-headquartered company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Unilever also sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, as well as an overall VGM grade of “A.”Unilever’s projected EPS growth of 31.97% blows out the industry average of 7.71% and crushes Proctor & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) 6.46%. The company also outpaces the industry with projected sales growth of 9.11%. Unilever’s 30.73% cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a solid growth trajectory, especially compared to the industry’s 7.28% average.The company also earned an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. This metric helps to indicate when the timing is favorable to enter a stock in order to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Bottom LineUnilever’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ranking and it’s “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum help demonstrate that the company is in a solid position, both today and going forward. Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, the CPG powerhouse might just be a stock to consider.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.
