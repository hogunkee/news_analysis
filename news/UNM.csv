Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterUnum Group is likely to witness a decline in operating income at its Unum U.K. business in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company is also likely to have experienced lower sales volume in this segment in the second quarter.Further, the company is likely to report lower premium income at its Closed Block segment, owing to expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. In addition, the company’s Corporate unit has likely incurred an operating loss in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Also, Unum Group might have experienced a higher debt level, which in turn will increase interest expenses. The company is also likely to record a rise in total benefits and expenses in the second quarter.However, the company has likely reported better-than-expected results at its Unum U.S. and Colonial Life units, fueled by improved premium income.Additionally, continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.With respect to the surprise trend, the company delivered positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.39%.Unum Group Price and EPS Surprise  Unum Group Price and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Unum Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Also, earnings slumped 33.7% year over year due to a decline in revenues.Quarter in DetailAmerisafe’s total operating revenues decreased 3.7% from the prior-year quarter to $94.9 million, but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Gross written premiums in the quarter were up 0.6% to $81.1 million, primarily due to increase in payroll audits and related premium adjustments, partly offset by declines in voluntary premiums.AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AMERISAFE, Inc. QuoteNet investment income decreased 6.9% year over year to $7.3 million. This was mainly due to increase in the value of an investment in a limited partnership hedge fund in the year-ago quarter.Total expenses came in at $77.14 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter led by higher loss and loss adjustments incurred, and underwriting and other operating costs.Net combined ratio, a measure of profitability (lower the better) was 88.3%, deteriorating 1150 basis points (bps) year over year.The company incurred a one-time non-cash charge of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter, on account of estimated impact of revaluation of its net deferred tax assets pursuant to the Tax Reform Act enacted in December.Financial UpdateAmerisafe exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $55.56 million, down 5.7% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2017, total shareholders’ equity was $425.4 million, down 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Operating return on equity was 11.4%, down 530 bps year over year.Book value per share as of Dec 31, 2017 was $22.10, down 6.8% from the prior-year quarter.Dividend Hike, Share Repurchase NilOn Feb 22, 2018, the company increased its regular quarterly dividend by 10% to 22 cents per share.  This increased dividend will be payable on Mar 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 9, 2018.During the quarter, no shares were repurchased under the company’s share repurchase plan.Our TakeAmerisafe’s results reflect continued suffering from softness in workers compensation market, which has been pressurizing revenues since the past three years.

9,UNM,"Historic volatility has shaken the stock market badly and pushed it to correction territory last week, with investors fearing the end of cheap money policy era due to higher inflation, faster growth and rising budget deficits. This has raised the appeal of value investing (read: Best and Worst ETFs of Last Week).This is especially true as value stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market. Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect the company’s true long-term fundamentals. This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price.As a result, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. In fact, these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long-term investment horizon. Also, value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets.The long-term fundamentals for the stocks have been bullish given accelerating global economic growth, strong corporate earnings and the euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and high consumer confidence.In particular, the biggest tax overhaul in decades is expected to provide a huge boost to the value stocks. This is because massive tax cuts will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities, and fatty dividends, prompting investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks (read: Volatility ETF Crash: Important Takeaways).Given this, investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current erratic market. For them, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that will likely outperform in the coming weeks if volatility prevails.ETF PicksUsing our database, we have selected popular value ETFs that provide exposure to the broad stock market instead of a particular sector and have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with an expense ratio of below 0.50%.

In local currency, the figure declined 7.1% year over year to £22.4 million.Benefit ratio was 75.8%, up 820 basis points (bps) due to higher claim incidence in the group long-term disability product line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several products of the company added to this downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 6% year over year to $382.1 million on sales growth in recent quarters. Adjusted operating income decreased 16.5% to $66.7 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 340 bps year over year to 54.8%.Closed Block: Premium income reduced 4.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business.

This was mainly driven by reduced operating expenses and higher investment income.Capital ManagementAs of Dec 31, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 390%.

12,UNM,"The board of directors of W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) recently approved a 7.1% increase in dividends as well as a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share, banking on a solid capital position.The company will now pay a dividend of 60 cents per share annually or 15 cents quarterly, yielding 0.8% based on the closing price of $76.47 as of May 31, 2018. Shareholders of record on Jun 15 should be awarded with the meatier dividend on Jul 5, 2018.The company boasts an impressive track of dividend hikes at regular intervals and the recent raise marks its 13th increase since 2005. The company’s dividend has grown 50% over the last five years. Its payout ratio of 33.2 betters the industry average of about 18.With respect to special dividend, the recent one marks the seventh approval since 2012. Shareholders of record on Jun 11 should be rewarded with the meatier dividend on Jun 18, 2018.W.R. Berkley’s engagement in shareholder-friendly moves is well-supported by its firm capital position, driven by operational efficiency. This property and casualty insurer maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows.We expect such effective capital deployment to sustain in the long run as the company continues to benefit from a growing contribution by new startup units, well-poised international business, rate increases and a reserving discipline driving solid cash flow generation. The overhaul of tax rate should also lend additional support.W.R. Berkley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, shares of the company have gained 6.9%, outperforming the industry’s decrease of 1.4%. Its operational excellence aiding effective capital deployment should help continue the stock's bull run.  Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted strategy to solidify investor confidence in the stock.

13,UNM,"In a bid to enhance shareholder value, the board of directors of Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 13% and approved a new $750-million share buyback program.The new dividend payout amounts to 24 cents per share compared with 23 cents paid earlier. The annualized dividend of $1.04 per share yields 2.7%, based on the closing price of $38.54 as of May 24. Shareholders are expected to be awarded with the meatier dividend during the third quarter of 2018.Unum Group boasts an impressive track record of annual dividend raises. The latest hike marks the 10th straight year of increase, translating into a staggering 247% rise over a decade. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) accident and health insurer’s dividend yield betters the industry average of 1.9%.  Also, given its financial position and lower financial leverage compared the industry’s tally, the trend of continuous hikes is likely to sustain for good.Apart from dividend increases, Unum Group engages in share repurchases to lower the share count and boost its bottom line. To that end, the board of directors authorized the company to buy back up to $750 million shares through Nov 24, 2019. The new program replaces the previous $750-million program, scheduled to expire on Nov 25, 2018.With $100 million spent on buying back 2.1 million s    hares in the first quarter of 2018, Unum Group has repurchased $3.4 billion worth shares since the fourth quarter of 2008. The company estimates a $400-million share buyback this year.  The insurer’s concerted efforts to add shareholder value make its stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.A sturdy financial position, backed by a consistent solid operational efficiency by core operations, enables the company to generate enough capital. A lower tax rate is also providing additional cushion. This in turn places it well to augment its payout momentum or engage in other shareholder-friendly moves.Shares of Unum Group have lost 29.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%. However, we believe that the company’s leading status as a writer of voluntary business in the United States, its conservative pricing and reservation practices plus strategic endeavors to boost shareholder value will likely help rebound the shares.  Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted strategy to solidify their investor confidence in the stock.

16,UNM,"A healthy business with stable sales growth is the key to survival in today’s fast changing and highly competitive environment. So, superior revenues are essential to drive growth. Most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities. Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations.In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis, these are valued based on revenues and not on earnings. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company’s future earnings performance.While sales growth is an important metric for any corporation for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making, this in isolation does not reflect too much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.Hence, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Chattanooga, TN, Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) provides group and individual disability insurance products and services. The company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports automatic test equipment. This North Reading, MA-based company currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), based in Fremont, CA, designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.

17,UNM,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) boasts an excellent franchise and strong market position in supplemental health insurance in both Japan and the U.S.  During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year, driven by favorable performance by its U.S. business along with share buyback. The 2017 guidance (earnings per share between $6.40 to $6.65 ) was also reaffirmed.Aflac U.S. continues to perform strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010 (CAGR of 3.1%) and the trend continued in the first half of 2017 (total revenue up 1.8%). The company has undertaken a number of growth initiatives in this segment, which will further drive up its revenues.    The company’s strong financial position and disciplined capital management are impressive. It has been increasing dividend for the past 34 years. The company intends to increase its dividend for the 35th time this year. Its dividend yield of 2.13% compares favorably with the industry’s dividend yield of 1.99%. It recently authorized a new share buyback plan of 40 million shares.The company’s stock has gained 16% year to date, outperforming the 14% rally of the industry it belongs to. Given its favorable 2017 earnings guidance and progress on fundamentals, we expect the stock to continue to perform well in the coming quarters.Nevertheless, persistent low interest rates in the region have put pressure on revenue growth from Japan business.  In order to fight with this, the company has deemphasized sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in the region, which has created a dent in revenues from the segment to some extent.Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary, which will provide it enhanced business flexibility. The company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Given that the company derives almost 70% of total revenues from Japan, it is greatly exposed to foreign currency volatility. A weaker yen hurt second-quarter results by 2 cents a share when compared to the year-ago quarter. Its pre-tax hedge cost guidance remains in the $250–$270 million range for 2017. These costs will put pressure on the company’s bottom line.Aflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the space are Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Employer Holdings, Inc. (EIG  -  Free Report) and Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amerisafe’s second-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.9%.Unum beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.1%.Employer Holdings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 27.9%.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.

18,UNM,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are slated to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% topping revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Industry TrendsInsurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft performance in the to-be-reported quarter which will drag the sector’s fourth-quarter results. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will improve 8.4% with revenues increasing 2.4% year over year.A slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer due to the California wildfires. As a result, insurers have hiked prices that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. With higher prices, insurers not only will enjoy higher premiums going forward but also be well-equipped to settle claims without hurting profitability.In addition, since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the Fed has reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have improved moderately from the historical lows.Moreover, the tax reform policy, enacted in December 2017, that lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%, is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income for some players in the fourth quarter.Stocks to ConsiderFirst, Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment that has been performing strongly as evident from rise in revenues since 2010.Also, we expect sales increase to continue in the fourth quarter given the number of growth initiatives such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan. Premium growth continues to be pressured by first-sector savings product, WAYS, and a portion of block reaching paid-up status.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.49%. Despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank, a negative earnings ESP makes the prediction difficult.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the Annuity segment is $264 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 9.1%.Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company’s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. The fourth quarter is likely to be aided by this segment’s performance as well.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #2, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes the positive earnings surprise prediction inconclusive.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8%.Moreover, the company has likely experienced premium growth at both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by improving sales and persistency.However, the results of Unum U.K. are expected to have remained soft, due to a challenging economic environment.Our proven model shows that Unum Group has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.

19,UNM,"MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 31, after market close.We expect the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to benefit from improvements in the auto insurance business. The company has been making targeted rate increases in auto insurance in recent years. These price increases, along with other management actions, will drive profitability in this line of business. Overall, P&C sales may also benefit from price increases and management actions to drive value. Net income for this subsegment is expected at $80 million, up 86% year over year.We expect the company’s U.S. business segment to showcase a strong quarter of earnings and sales from Retirement and Income Solutions driven by higher sales of pension risk transfers and stable value products.In its Asia business, we expect to see increased sales driven by a successful sales campaign in Korea, as well as a larger agency force and continued success of its whole life critical illness product in China. These increases will be partially offset by lower yen-denominated life product sales in Japan and the continued impact from regulatory changes in Hong Kong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net income from this segment is pegged at $312 million, down 11.9%.In its Latin America business, we expect growth across several lines of business within Mexico and Chile, which should drive increased premiums and policy fee income. Positive net flows, primarily from Mexico and Chile should result in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net income from this segment is pegged at $149 million, up 22% year over year.In its EMEA business, we expect to see growth across several European markets and in its accident & health and credit life businesses in Turkey, partially offset by lower premium persistency in its employee benefits business in the Gulf. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net income from this segment is pegged at $79 million, up 9.7% year over year.MetLife has been generating enough free cash flow, which it uses for investment purposes and buying back shares. Repurchases made by the company in the fourth quarter will aid its bottom line.We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income driven by a favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity. The company’s bottom line will be aided by its expense management initiatives.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.6%.MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that MetLife is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: MetLife has an Earning ESP of -0.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MetLife carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the insurance sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter.Amerisafe Inc.

Though the same is far from hitting a historical high, it nevertheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a thriving economy and has hinted at two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the enforcement of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been reduced to 21% from 35%. This rate slash will possibly lend an extra boost to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter encountered a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the disasters might still leave the company’s underwriting profitability unhurt. Insurers having already suffered the perils of cat loss last year, should have managed to endure the shortfalls in first-quarter 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability is also slightly pressed.Nonetheless, improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are likely to have cushioned insurers to survive the deficits.A wide-ranged product portfolio, expanded global footprint and tactical M&A activity might have aided insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) will report quarterly results this week. Let’s take a look at how things pan out for the following insurers ahead of their quarterly releases on May 1.Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.’s (AJG  -  Free Report) top line is expected to have gained traction from organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. Brokerage segment will be benefitted from a favorable forex impact while Employee benefit consulting operations are estimated to have registered organic growth from new business opportunities. Lower tax rate is likely to boost the companies’ bottom line and margin growth directly. However, a projected rise in expenses will likely limit the operating margin expansion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a substantial 277.5% year-over-year increase. Arthur J. Gallagher carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes our surprise prediction difficult as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. (Read more: Arthur J.

Nevertheless, net premium has been declining at Encompass for the past two years. Decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns have impacted the overall top-line trends, to some extent.             The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.48 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 51.2% year over year. Allstate’s favorable Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.55% make us confident of an earnings surprise in the first quarter.

Riding on prudent underwriting, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends, margins are anticipated to have strengthened in core business segments. However, volatility in Unum U.K. seems to have persisted due to the  Brexit buzz, which probably induced an unreliable business environment. Although persistency is likely to have remained soft, an increase in force is but expected to have driven premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 22.5% year-over-year rise. Unum carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its combination with an Earnings ESP of -0.14% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.

23,UNM,"Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 1. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Sales are likely to have increased in both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life, which in turn drove premiums higher in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium is pegged at $2.2 billion. While the consensus mark for premium in Unum U.S. stands at $1.4 billion, the same at Colonial Life is projected at $394 million.Given prudent underwriting, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends, margins are anticipated to have strengthened in core business segments.Performance of the company’s dental product offering is expected to have improved with the rollout of the same to Unum U.S. sales force as well as the Colonial Life distribution channel.An improving rate environment is estimated to have increased net investment income. The Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $624 million.However, volatility in Unum U.K. might have persisted due to the noise surrounding Brexit, which induced an uncertain business environment. Persistency is likely to have remained soft but an increase in force is expected to have driven premiums.Nonetheless, lower tax incidence owing to a drop in the tax rate will possibly cushion the bottom line. Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted the metric. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25, up 22.6% year over year.What our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Unum Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Unum Group has an Earnings ESP of -0.14%.

However, the company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Therefore, this combination leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows:American Financial Group, Inc.

24,UNM,"Amerisafe Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings per share of 86 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8%. Earnings were up 21% year over year.The bottom line was driven by an increase in net investment income and a decline in total expenses.AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AMERISAFE, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailAmerisafe’s total operating revenues decreased 3.2% from the prior-year quarter to $94.6 million, but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2%.Gross written premiums in the quarter were up 2.4% year over year to $97.3 million, primarily due to higher voluntary premiums written, payroll audits and related premium adjustments.Net investment income increased 7.4% year over year to $7.2 million. This was mainly due to an increase in the value of an investment in a limited partnership hedge fund in the year-ago quarter.Total expenses came in at $74.8 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter due to lower loss and loss adjustments incurred, and underwriting and other operating costs.Net combined ratio, a measure of profitability (lower the better) was 85.6% compared with 86.6% in the year-ago quarter.Financial UpdateAmerisafe exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $36.1 million, down 35.1% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, total shareholders’ equity was $432.1 million, up 1.6% from Dec 31, 2017.Operating return on equity was 15.4%, up 360 bps year over year.Book value per share as of Mar 31, 2018 was $22.43, up 1.5% from Dec 31, 2017.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateOn Apr 24, the company declared its quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share.  This dividend is payable Jun 22, to its shareholders of record as of Mar 8.During the quarter, no shares were repurchased under the company’s share repurchase plan.Bottom LineAmerisafe’s topline growth reflect continued suffering from softness in the workers compensation market, which has been putting pressure on revenues for the past three years. However, its efficient claims management, favorable loss and frequency trends, prudent reserve analytics and improved operating leverage should be helpful for the company.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderAmerisafe carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

25,UNM,"Value investors typically tend to get fixated on the price-to-earnings (P/E) strategy while looking for stocks that are trading at a bargain. P/E, without a shadow of a doubt, is the most popular multiple used by investors for assessing the fair market value of a stock. But even this widely popular valuation metric suffers a few drawbacks.Why EV/EBITDA is a Better Substitute to P/E?While the popularity of P/E stems from its simplicity, another valuation metric called EV/EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential.While EV/EBITDA is a more complicated metric, it is also more comprehensive than P/E in stock evaluation. EV/EBITDA determines the total value of a company, while P/E solely considers its equity portion.Also referred to as the enterprise multiple, EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. Simply put, it is the total value of a firm.EBITDA, the other component of the ratio, is a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it eliminates non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the better it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV/EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account that P/E does not. Due to this reason, EV/EBITDA is typically used to value possible acquisition targets, as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Companies with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another key drawback of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In comparison, EV/EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV/EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels.However, EV/EBITDA is also not without its downsides and alone can’t conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Thus, instead of solely relying on EV/EBITDA, you can club it with the other key ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired outcome. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 14 stocks that passed the screen:SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) is one of the largest grocery wholesalers and retailers in the United States. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has an expected year-over-year earnings growth rate of 19.7% for fiscal 2018 and a Value Score of A.Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) is the industry leader in disability income protection and one of the top providers of supplemental benefits in the United States.

The bottom line also improved 7.1% year over year.Strong performance at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments was partially offset by weakness at Unum U.K. business.Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteIn the reported quarter, the company displayed growth and disciplined execution of strategy. It also efficiently returned capital to shareholders.Including after-tax realized investment gains of 2 cents, net income grew 7% year over year to $1.07 per share.Total operating revenue of Unum Group was $2.8 billion, up 1.5% year over year. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Premium income improved, whereas net investment income declined, both on a year-over-year basis.Total benefits and expenses were up 2.3% year over year to $2.5 billion. Rise in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits, commissions, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other expenses led to overall increase in costs.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.4 billion, up 4.5% year over year. Operating income grew 9.1% year over year to $247.8 million.Unum U.K.: Premium income decreased 9.9% year over year to $126.8 million. In local currency, premium inched up 1% year over year to £99.1 million. This was mainly due to growth in the group life and supplemental line of business on favorable persistency and sales improvement.Operating income was $28.9 million, significantly down 21.7% year over year. In local currency, the figure declined 12.1% year over year to £36.9 million.Benefit ratio was 75.6%, up 550 basis points (bps). This was owing to unfavorable claims solutions and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the second quarter of 2017 across several of the company’s products added to this downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 7.1% year over year to $376.3 million on sales growth in recent quarters and stable persistency. Operating income grew 5% to $81.8 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 20 bps year over year to 51.3%.Closed Block: Premium income decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. Nonetheless, improvement in premium income for the long-term care line of business, owing to premium rate increases on certain in-force policies, limited the downside.Operating income was $32.6 million, flat year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $37.6 million, narrower than an operating loss of $39.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital ManagementAs of Jun 30, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was in excess of 395%.

27,UNM,"Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.83 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.3% and increased 7% year over year.Better-than-expected results were driven by favorable performance from the company’s U.S business along with share buyback.Total revenues remained unchanged year over year at $5.4 billion and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.48 billion.Return on equity was 16.5%, up 50 basis points year over year.Aflac Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteSegments ResultsAt its Japan segment, premium income, net of reinsurance agreements, decreased 2.7% year over year to $3.2 billion. Net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, decreased 7.9% to $557 million, due to lower reinvestment rates and increased amortized hedge costs.Total revenue declined 5.7% year over year to $3.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings decreased 1.4% to $791 million. Growth rates in Japan for the second quarter were suppressed as a result of a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate.The company’s U.S. segment reported a 1.9% year-over-year increase in premium income to $1.4 billion. Net investment income increased 2.3% year over year to $180 million.Total revenues increased 2.1% year over year to $1.6 billion. The pre-tax operating profit margin for the U.S. segment was 21%, up 200 basis points year over year.  In this segment, the company expects a long-term compound annual growth rate of 3% to 5% in new annualized premium sales.Dividend and Financial UpdateThe company spent $800 million on buying back shares in the first half of the year. At the end of the quarter, the company had 15.6 million shares available for purchase under its share buyback authorization.The company announced 43 cents quarterly dividend which will be paid on Sep 1, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug 23, 2017.Guidance Affirmed  The company kept its guidance intact. It expects to buy back $1.3–$1.5 billion worth shares in 2017. EPS is estimated between $6.40 and $6.65, assuming an average exchange rate of 108.70 yen to the dollar in 2016.If the yen averages 105–115 to the dollar in the third quarter, operating earnings, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, will be approximately $1.51 to $1.69 per diluted share.Our TakeAflac’s second-quarter earnings reflected strength in its U.S operations. Company-wide agent distribution, new product launch and ongoing investments in this segment will propel further growth.Nevertheless, Aflac continues to suffer from low interest rates in its Japan business and though major changes have been made in product mix to address this, currency woes persist. We, therefore, believe that the segment will remain under pressure in the next few quarters.Zacks Rank and Other ReleasesAflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

28,UNM,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with 26% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reporting quarterly numbers already. Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, the performance of 128 index members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 77.3% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.3% outperforming on the top-line front. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).The Finance sector’s results (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) have not been very impressive, but aren’t too disappointing either. Of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index, 54.1% that have reported quarterly results show 7.4% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for bottom line and 68.6% for top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector. Let’s see how the second quarter has turned up for insurers.Results of insurers exposed to catastrophe losses will witness a dent in underwriting margins on account of several catastrophe losses that occurred during the quarter under review. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Some insurers have estimated catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. projects $627 million (pre-tax) in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Another component of insurer’s top line, net investment income, has witnessed improvement, but still remains below historical levels, owing to still-low interest rates.Nevertheless, the recent increase in interest rates by the Fed should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should benefit from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Top line may also benefit from an improving economy and revived consumer sentiments which may lead to increased demand for insurance products.On the flip side, pricing woes linger. Insurers having fat capital reserves are fighting hard to gain business in a highly competitive environment and one of the most common ways to achieve underwriting targets is by lower pricing. Certain lines of insurance – commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability are mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, mergers and acquisitions and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase are like to benefit insurers.Let’s peek into these five insurance companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 27.Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This makes surprise prediction difficult despite the company’s Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last quarter, Aflac, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.09%. It surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.85%.Aflac’s Japan business is expected to benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company’s emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive and carry strong and stable margins.  In its U.S. business segment, we expect to see improved persistency, which in turn should support premium growth. The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion (read more: Will Changing Business Strategy Aid Aflac Q2 Earnings?).Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Hartford Financial has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, Hartford Financial, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.96%. In two of the last four quarters, Hartford Financial missed expectations. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 9.41% of the last four quarters.We expect Hartford Financial’s results to be supported by improved performance of its Personal Auto business. Commercial Lines in small and middle markets are likely to perform well, boosting both the top and the bottom lines, continuing the previous quarter’s trend. The Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segment will likely deliver a solid performance, reflecting the company’s claims expertise and improvements made in its book of business over the years (read more: Hartford Financial Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?).Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8%.Notably, Unum Group expects 2017 operating earnings to grow at or slightly above 5-8% range.Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.Moreover, the company has likely experienced premium growth at both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by improving sales and persistency.Further, voluntary benefits sales at Unum U.S. have likely improved in the fourth quarter.However, the results of Unum U.K. are expected to have remained soft, due to a challenging economic environment.Also, the company is estimated to display lower operative revenues at both Unum U.K. and Closed Block segments in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7.

30,UNM,"Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Jan 31, are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment. This unit has been performing strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010 for the past many years, a trend that continued through the first nine months of 2017. We expect to see strong financial performance and continued strength in the profitability of Aflac U.S. led by the ongoing investment by the company in this business.Also, we expect to see new sales increase to continue in the fourth quarter given a number of growth initiatives such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan. Premium growth continues to be pressured by first sector savings product, WAYS, and a portion of block reaching paid-up status.The curtailment of sale of first sector products as well as weakening of yen led to a decline in revenues by 0.3% in 2016 which further fell by 5.7% in first nine months of 2017. The restriction on sale of first-sector products, which carry higher premiums, along with currency volatility is further expected to suppress top-line growth in the region in the quarter under consideration.  Investment income in this segment has been pressured by lower reinvestment yields and higher hedge costs and the same is expected for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is pegged at $3.7 billion, which signifies a decline of 17.8% year over year.The company is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary. The conversion will enhance Aflac's business development flexibility. The company booked approximately $24 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first nine months of 2017.The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Aflac derives almost 70% of total revenues from Japan, which exposes it to significant foreign currency volatility. This might hurt its margins.However, the company’s continued efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.55%.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Aflac has an Earning ESP of -0.49%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aflac carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. The company’s negative ESP thus leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are some companies worth considering as our model shows that these possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  Amerisafe Inc.

31,UNM,"Lincoln National Corp. (LNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 31, after market close.We expect to see an increase in total annuity sales, driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. The company has gained market share in 2017, benefiting from products that provide more investment choices and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. New product launches (Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider, introduced late in the second quarter, has led to increased sales and is continuing to gain traction) and upgrades to their existing ones, will further aid annuity sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $264 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 9.1%.Other Developments in Q4  Increased Top Line From Life Insurance Unit: Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company has changed in its sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.Higher Contribution in Group Protection Unit: The company’s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. Sales in 2016 were up nearly 18% and 14% in the first nine months of 2017. This strong sales growth indicates the resilience of its distribution channel.The company’s pricing remains disciplined and its outlook for sales growth is aligned with its long-term target of mid single-digit increases. We expect sales growth and improving persistency to contribute to fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $26 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 62.5%.Strong Performance in Retirement Plan Service: This segment is expected to show growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. This will be driven by higher sales growth from digital innovations and product enhancements, that are focused on simple and transparent pricing, improved customer service and strong retention.Increased Expenses: The company has undertaken digital initiatives to improve the customer experience. These efforts will result in significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements, but will cause the company to incur digitization expense of roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017.Balance Sheet Strength and Capital Management: Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback will drive the bottom line. Lincoln National’s balance sheet strength and solid capital generation, which enables it to buy back shares, will provide an extra support to the bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.83%.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

32,UNM,"During the time of market volatility, investors often rely on value investing rather than other options like growth or momentum. As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate, value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price.However, this apparently simple value investment technique has some drawbacks and not understanding the strategy properly may often lead to “value traps”. In such a situation, these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once drove the share price down, turn out to be persistent. There are many value investment yardsticks such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount.However, for investors looking to escape such value traps, it is also vital to determine where the stock is headed in the next 12 to 24 months. Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. This is where lies the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/ Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five out of the 26 stocks that qualified the screening:Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report): The company develops and distributes anti-aging personal care products and nutritional supplements under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex category brands worldwide.  The stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 8.8%.Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report): The company is a prominent name in the field of omnichannel retail with more than 1,100 stores in 49 states. Apart from a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A, the company also has an impressive growth rate of 13.7% for the next fiscal.Olin Corporation (OLN  -  Free Report): This global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products operates through three segments - Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls; Epoxy and Winchester. The company has an impressive long-term growth rate of 13.8%. The stock has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.

(SPR  -  Free Report): The company designs, manufactures, and supplies commercial aero structures worldwide.

33,UNM,"Shares of Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $91.3 on Jan 9, eventually closing a tad lower at $90. The gain is believed to be driven by the positive impact of the recently signed tax reform.What Aided the Price RiseThe company recently announced that it will invest $250 million in different areas such as employee welfare, business growth and provide support to childhood cancer initiatives.This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Per management, this easy tax regime provides it an opportunity to make investments like the latest one.Moreover, for its U.S workforce, Aflac intends to make better retirement benefits by increasing the company's 401(k) match from 50% to 100% on the first 4% of employee’s contribution while making a one-time contribution of $500 to every employee's 401(k) plan. It will also offer certain hospital and accident insurance products to all employees free of charge as the company currently does with its core cancer insurance products.On the business growth front, the company plans to invest in the technology and digital businesses like Empowered — a subsidiary of Aflac.Share Price PerformanceAflac’s stock has gained 29.6% in a year’s time, outperforming its industry’s growth of 21.5%.Is Further Upside Left?This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock continues to suffer from:Conversion Costs: Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary. This, in turn, will enhance its business development flexibility. In fact, the  company has booked approximately $24 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first nine months of 2017.The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Pressure on Business in Japan: Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan, which contributes nearly 70% of the company’s revenues. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in the region.The curtailment of these products as well as weakening of yen has led to a decline in revenues by 0.3% in 2016 and 5.7% in the first nine months of 2017. Going forward, the restriction on sale of first-sector products, which carry higher premiums along with currency volatility are further expected to suppress top-line growth in the region.  Forex Volatility: The company’s significant exposure to Japan makes its vulnerable to foreign currency volatility. Evidently, Aflac’s earnings have been hampered by the alarming weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar for the past many years.While foreign currency adversely impacted bottom line by 34 cents in 2016, the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate hurt operating earnings per diluted share by 8 cents in the first nine months of 2017. Currency volatility is expected to continue affecting earnings in the coming quarters.Overvalued: Aflac's valuation looks stretched at the current level. The company currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6, near its highest range. The ratio is also higher than the P/B ratio of 1.4 for the industry.Based on the above-mentioned factors, we believe the stock will remain under pressure in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the space are Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Trupanion, Inc. (TRUP  -  Free Report) and Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amerisafe’s beat estimates in two of the four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.4%.Trupanion beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 38.8%.Unum beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

34,UNM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Unum Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.26, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.47. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Unum Group’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 9.75 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.91. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Unum Group has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.96, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Unum Group stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Unum Group has a P/S ratio of about 1.11. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.40 right now. This makes the stock look undervalued from this aspect as well.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Unum Group currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Unum Group a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Unum Group is just 1.85, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.23. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, UNM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Unum Group might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score and Momentum Score of F, each. This gives UNM a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s consensus estimate for the current quarter has remained stable, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.2% in the past two months. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Unum Group Price and Consensus  Unum Group Price and Consensus | Unum Group QuoteFurther, the company has long-term earnings growth rate of 7%, and it sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineUnum Group is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #2 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among top 2% of more than 250 industries) which hints at favorable broader factors. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!     It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

35,UNM,"Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.Unum Group is expected to have witnessed improved operating income at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by higher premiums and favorable risk results. Sales at both the segments likely have improved, thus fueling the company’s total premiums.The company’s voluntary benefits business likely has performed better.Continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.The Unum U.K. is expected to have remained soft at the backdrop of challenging economic environment.The Zacks Consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.04 on $2.8 billion revenues. While the bottom line reflects a 4.9% increase, the top line translates to a 2.3% increase, both on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Unum Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Unum Group has an Earnings ESP of -0.51%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.03 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Unum Group Price and EPS Surprise Unum Group Price and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteZacks Rank: Unum Group carries a Zacks Rank #2, which though increases the predictive power of ESP, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are as follows:CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

37,UNM,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries:1) Healthcare: +23,000(up 324,000 over the last 12 months)2) Transportation & Warehousing: +22,0003) Professional & Business Services: +13,000(up 600,000 over the last 12 months)4) Financial Activities: +10,000Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 4 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(CNC  -  Free Report) Centene(Healthcare)(LSTR  -  Free Report) Landstar(Transportation & Warehousing)(TSS  -  Free Report) Total System Services(Professional & Business Services)(UNM  -  Free Report) Unum Group(Financial Activities)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place.

39,UNM,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions of late. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.1% downward while for 2018, the consensus mark moved nearly 1% south.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive Value Score of C. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Shares of Cincinnati Financial have also underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 1.7% in contrast to the industry’s 17% rally. Cincinnati Financial has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years and the first nine months of 2017 were no exception. Higher insurance losses and contract holders’ benefits besides underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses were primarily responsible for this increase. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.The company witnessed a noticeable decline with respect to its bottom line in 2016 and the same trend continued in the first nine months of 2017. Therefore, the company is not expecting a major turnaround on the bottom-line front in the near term.  This apart, the company with its concentration in the Midwest region has been exposed to devastating cat events. To that end, it has been experiencing high level of catastrophe loss over a considerable period of time and the first nine months of 2017 were no exception.The company faced the wrath of Mother Nature with an unprecedented hurricane activity in the third quarter, which induced such a massive catastrophe loss. Further, these damages also resulted in deteriorating the company’s combined ratio, a measure of profitability used by an insurance company to denote its daily operational performance.Notably, the fourth quarter will bear the brunt of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires, due to which the company has projected losses of not less than $1 million in each. Thus, such cat events will put a dent in the overall performance of the company.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over the last few years and the same was witnessed in the first nine months of 2017. Dwindlig cashflows might restrain the company's financial flexibility.Choosing the StocksWhile Cincinnati Financial doesn’t appear to be an attractive pick right now, there are a few solid stocks in the insurance space promising greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have narrowed down to three favorable stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.

41,UNM,"Despite the volatile operating environment, with the occurrence of natural calamities, regulatory changes, Federal Reserve’s decision as to when hike the interest rate again, there have been quite a few insurance companies which have delivered better-than-expected results in the third quarter of 2017.Even though the aforementioned challenges are anticipated to impact the upcoming quarter, we remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in the near term.We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better in the impending quarter, raising optimism among investors.Rising Interest Rates — A Much Awaited Boon to InsurersIf we focus on the life insurance industry, we can identify its connection with interest rates, given the high sensitivity of the players’ business models to interest rates. Therefore, life insurance industry’s heavy dependence on investment income will benefit most companies from the rising interest rate environment. Thus, rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide a required relief to insurers to maintain margins.Although the Federal Reserve has left the interest rates unchanged (following the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on Sep 20, 2017) ranging between 1% and 1.25%, the life insurers are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year, indicated by policymakers at the meeting. Interestingly, the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates thrice in 2018. Hence, the overall industry pins hope on the investment income growth in the immediate term. This in turn might also help strengthen its market position.A progressing rate environment will lessen the burden on life insurers’ investment income, boosting their earnings. This will additionally, accelerate the insurance companies’ overall rise in the future.Other Aspects Likely to Boost Future PerformanceContinued growth in premiums and a better control over underwriting expenses are anticipated to lend a substantial boost to life insurers’ income in the quarter ahead. The individual life insurance premiums, which witnessed modest growth over a considerable period of time, will likely continue the trend with rising demand, driven by an improving job market and the aging population (for retirement savings).Interestingly, life insurers are increasingly moving toward redesigned and re-priced products with potential to enhance their liability profiles and profitability in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, stronger corporate bonds and improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment losses. Also, bettering economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns to investors. Life insurers are expected to gain from this favorable trend if it continues in the long run. In fact, a flourishing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverage.Further, the demand for life insurance is estimated to improve and fortify on the back of customers’ need for greater safety in a volatile financial environment. Per a recent report by the worldwide insurance association, Life Insurance Management Research Association (LIMRA), minimum 34% of Americans are likely to buy life insurance in 2017. This will in fact encourage demand for life insurance with the industry reaping benefits from such an upside.  Key PicksDespite challenging market conditions and evolving customer demands, insurers might gain from improved interest rates and an improving economy that are capable of yielding profits through underlying strength and business modification.We zeroed in on four insurers that hold promise to deliver favorable results, banking on a solid price performance and a favorable Zacks Rank backed by positive estimate revisions.Duluth, GA-based Primerica, Inc. (PRI  -  Free Report) distributes financial products to middle income households in the United States and Canada. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being revised 2.7% upward to $5.36 and 3.1% to $6.07 for 2018 over the last 60 days. This is reflected through the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Primerica have rallied 21.6% quarter to date, outperforming the industry’s rise of 10.3% and substantially lying ahead of the S&P 500 index’s 3.5% gain.  DeRidder, LA-based Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report) offers workers compensation insurance in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share moved up 3.9% to $3.22 for 2017 and 1.3% to $3.07 for 2018 over the last 60 days. This is reflected through the company’s same bullish Zacks Rank of 2.Shares of Amerisafe have increased 12.3% quarter to date compared with the industry’s increase 5.1% and substantially outperforming the S&P 500 index’s gain of 3.5%.Reno, NV-based Employers Holdings, Inc. (EIG  -  Free Report) operates in the commercial property and casualty insurance industry primarily in the United States. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being moved 2.6% upward to $2.39 and 2.1% to $2.40 for 2018 over the last 60 days. The Zacks #2 Ranked player reflects this improvement.Shares of Employer Holdings have climbed 8.6% quarter to date, coming in above the industry’s gain of 5.1% and substantially outperforming the S&P 500 index’s gain of 3.5%.  Chattanooga, TN-based Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) provides group and individual disability insurance products and services, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom.

42,UNM,"After surging to peak levels, the Dow and the S&P 500 snapped an eight-week winning streak — the longest since 2013 — while Nasdaq ended a six-week winning streak. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 logged its biggest weekly decline since August. The sell-off stemmed from concerns over the delay in the implementation of corporate tax cuts, which happened be the major driver of the recent stock market rally (read: 5 Biggest ETF Winners of Trump Trade Resurgence).The tax plan unveiled by the Senate Finance Committee differs from that of House Republicans on various fronts. The Senate proposal defers the corporate tax rate cut of 20% until 2019, does not repeal the estate tax, and leaves the mortgage interest deduction unchanged. Additionally, the proposal maintains the current number of individual income tax brackets of seven but slashes the top bracket by a percentage point to 38.5%. It also provides small-business owners with a deduction rather than a special business rate.Given this, Trump’s proposal will face several roadblocks for approval by this year-end. Investors should note that tax reform is a key catalyst to keep the bull market alive. As such, delay or no progress in tax overhaul could lead to huge sell-off in the stock market. Further, if the Senate proposal is passed, then the battle for tax reforms will intensify giving a way for the major correction in the stock market. According to Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere, the failure of corporate tax cuts could trigger a correction of as much as 15% in stocks.Moreover, one of the leading indicators, high-yield market, has started to flash warning signs for the broader equity market. The last week sell-off in these bonds could be a precursor of a larger pullback in the stock market (read: Treasury ETFs in Focus on Potential Delay in Tax Reform).However, the Arms Index, also known as the short-term trading index and used to measure buying or selling intensity, suggesting investors are in a buying mood. It is calculated by dividing the Advance-Decline Ratio by the Advance-Decline Volume Ratio. An Arms index value above 1.00 is a bearish signal while value below 1.00 is a bullish sign. A value of 1.00 indicates a balanced market. As of the close on Nov 11, the NYSE Arms rose to 0.77 and the Nasdaq Arms slipped to 0.80.Further, solid corporate earnings and pickup in global economic activity have been the key drivers of the stock market rally throughout this year despite the political turmoil in Washington. The combination of these two factors will continue to keep the positive momentum alive in the stock market albeit at a slower pace.How to Play?Given this, value investing seems appealing at present. Here, one can bet on stocks with strong fundamentals – earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow – that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market. Value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. In fact, these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long-term investment horizon and are less susceptible to trending markets.As a result, investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current volatile market environment. For them, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that will likely outperform in the coming weeks if volatility persists.ETF PicksUsing our database, we have selected popular value ETFs that provide exposure to the broad stock market instead of a particular sector and have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with an expense ratio of below 0.50%.iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that are thought to be undervalued by the market relative to comparable companies by tracking the Russell 1000 Value Index.Zacks ETF Rank: #3Expense Ratio: 0.20%AUM: $36.8 billion    Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to track the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, which measures the performance of the largest U.S. value stocks (read: Value ETFs & Stocks to Beat Market Volatility).Zacks ETF Rank: #3Expense Ratio: 0.06%AUM: $33.7 billion    iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE  -  Free Report)This fund also offers exposure to large U.S. companies that are potentially undervalued but tracks the S&P 500(R) Value Index.Zacks ETF Rank: #3Expense Ratio: 0.18%AUM: $13.9 billionVanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE  -  Free Report)This fund targets the U.S. mid-cap segment and follows the CRSP US Mid Cap Value Index.Zacks ETF Rank: #2Expense Ratio: 0.07%AUM: $7.6 billionPowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1000 Portfolio (PRF  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the FTSE RAFI US 1000 Index, which measures the performance of the largest U.S. equities based on the following four fundamental measures: book value, cash flow, sales and dividends.Zacks ETF Rank: #3Expense Ratio: 0.39%AUM: $5.1 billionStock PicksFor stocks, we have chosen five top picks using the Zacks Stock Screener that fits our criteria: a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, a Value Style Score of A, a Zacks Industry Rank within the top 10%, and market cap of over $1 billion.

43,UNM,"Unum Group’s (UNM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 operating net income of $1.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. The bottom line also improved 11.2% year over year.Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteStrong performance at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments was partially offset by weakness at Unum U.K. business.The company’s sustained performance is driven by strong top-line growth, overall decent benefits experience and a good expense management. In the reported quarter, the company displayed growth and disciplined execution of strategy. It also efficiently returned capital to its shareholders.Including after-tax realized investment gains of 3 cents, net income improved 10.9% year over year to $1.12 per share.Total operating revenues of Unum Group was $2.8 billion, up 2.1% year over year. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Premium income improved, whereas net investment income declined, both on a year-over-year basis.Total benefits and expenses inched up 0.9% year over year to $2.5 billion. Rise in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits, commissions and amortization of deferred acquisition costs led to an overall increase in costs.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.4 billion, up 3.5% year over year. Operating income climbed 11.9% year over year to $258.4 million.Unum U.K.: Premium income grew 3.3% year over year to $131.5 million. In local currency, premium rose 3.6% year over year to £100.4 million. This was mainly owing to growth in the in-force block, resulting from prior-period sales and stable persistency.Operating income was $26.5 million, down 6% year over year. In local currency, the figure declined 6% year over year to £20.2 million.Benefit ratio was 74.9%, up 310 basis points (bps). This was owing to higher claim incidence and unfavorable claim resolutions in the group long-term disability product line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several products of the company added to this downside. However, a lower average claim size in the group life product line partially offset the downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 6.9% year over year to $378.7 million on sales growth in recent quarters and stable persistency. Operating income grew 3.4% to $81.7 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 20 bps year over year to 51.8%.Closed Block: Premium income decreased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. Nonetheless, improvement in premium income for the long-term care line of business owing to premium rate increases on certain in-force policies, limited the downside.Operating income was $26.6 million, falling nearly 7% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $36.2 million, narrower than the operating loss of $45.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by reduced operating expenses and decrease in interest expense owing to a lower level of outstanding debt, partially offset by a higher overall rate of interest.Capital ManagementAs of Sep 30, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 410%. Unum Group exited the quarter with cash and marketable securities worth $771 million.Book value per share of Unum Group increased 4.4% year over year to $42.11 as of Sep 30, 2017.The company spent around $100 million to buy back about 2 million shares in the quarter.Guidance TweakedUnum Group projects 2017 operating earnings per share to grow between 5% and 8% or slightly above the upper end of the range.Zacks RankUnum Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

44,UNM,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 17.4% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid numbers so far. The proportion of positive surprises is above average this quarter. Also, the estimate revision trend for the next quarter has been mostly favorable as Q4 estimates have gone up in the past couple of weeks.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 71.3% for earnings and 70.1% for revenues.Per the report, total earnings of S&P 500 companies for Q3 are expected to grow 2.6% year over year on 5% higher revenues.Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. Soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Nevertheless, an aging population and growing unemployment are likely to drive demand for insurance products.Prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment in recent years will likely provide strong support to overall earnings.Also, higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) is expected to witness improved operating income at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by higher premiums and favorable risk results. Sales at both the segments will likely improve, thus fueling the company’s total premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.04 per share on $2.8 billion revenues. While the bottom line reflects a 4.9% increase, the top line translates into a 2.3% increase, both on a year-over-year basis.Unum Group currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).However, its Earnings ESP of -0.51% makes surprise prediction difficult.

This unit has been performing strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010, a trend that continued through the first half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is pegged at $3.8 billion, which hints at a decline of 7.9% year over year.  (Read more Will Strong U.S. Business Aid Aflac's Q3 Earnings?).Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteAmerisafe Inc.

45,UNM,"MetLife Inc (MET  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have received rating action from A.M. Best. The rating giant has affirmed Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” of MetLife along with its Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR).Moreover, A.M Best has reiterated the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa-” of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, General American Life Insurance Company and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company.This apart, the rating giant has further affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a+” of MetLife’s Auto & Home affiliates group. The group includes Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, seven fully reinsured subsidiaries and a separately rated subsidiary — Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company. The outlook of these Credit Ratings remained stable.This rating actions acknowledges MetLife’s leading position in the group insurance market along with its vast geographic presence. The rating giant expects MetLife to gain steam from its focused business strategies like the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial. The divestment helped MetLife in lowering its exposure to softening interest rates and equity market sensitivity. Post the divestiture, MetLife generates almost half of its operating earnings from international business.Notably, despite the sustained soft interest rate environment, MetLife managed to generate strong revenues, stable operating earnings and cash flows, indicating its operational efficiency. The rating giant believes that this will contribute to the company’s organic earnings growth along with improving expense management. MetLife has also been able to maintain its financial leverage and interest coverage ratios within A.M. Best's expectations.However, these positives are partially offset by the high level of risks in its investment portfolio. A.M. Best believes that the risks stem from its securities lending and funding agreement-backed securities programs.  Although operating leverage remains within A.M. Best’s guidelines for its current rating on a consolidated basis, the rating giant expects MetLife to successfully manage its leverage going forward.MetLife is exposed to the possibility of earnings decline related to its run-off of MetLife Holdings segment and the Brighthouse spin-off in the short term.  The present volatility within some existing business lines and stiff competition within group benefits and the emerging markets in which MetLife operates also remain headwinds. Well reflective of these negatives, its shares have gained 11% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 20%. Coming to the subsidiaries of MetLife, the ratings reflect their strong capitalization and solid operating performance. The affiliates’ multiple-channel distribution network also adds to the extensive market expertise. National geographic diversification and marketing advantage derived from MetLife's established brand name recognition also helped these subsidiaries maintain their competitive edge. These ratings perfectly recognize the financial strength and support provided by MetLife to its units.Nevertheless, the rating giant is concerned that these tailwinds are partially negated by MetLife Auto & Home's considerable amount of underwriting leverage, its exposure to catastrophic events and a dividend policy hindering surplus growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMetLife presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Investors interested in the insurance space can consider better-ranked stocks like CNO Financial Group, Inc (CNO  -  Free Report), Unum Group.
