20,URI,"When looking at annual returns for the year, it would be a mistake to think they come at a steady rate. More often, the year is punctuated by fits and starts. The job of a swing trader is to capitalize on the upswings and sidestep the pullbacks.What's made the last year challenging is that defensive action on pullbacks often saw immediate rebounds to new highs. However, if you didn't take defensive action, you left yourself exposed to sector rotation. That could leave you with the wrong stocks as the indexes were making new highs.Taking a look at the action of IBD's SwingTrader over the last few months illustrates the point. Our current trades shrunk considerably as the Nasdaq composite spent time below its 5-day moving average and dipped below its 10-day line in mid-November. Skechers (SKX) was already on as a current trade, but the list expanded more aggressively starting on Nov. 16 (1). Scientific Games (SGMS), Illumina (ILMN), and United Rentals (URI) were good for some quick gains before the index started pulling back on Nov. 29 (2). Our defensive selling accelerated on Dec. 1 (3), a morning plagued by headlines that later proved to be false.On Dec. 7, the buying started again in earnest (4). Getting in early at these reversals, rather than waiting for new high ground, has been critical to staying in phase with the market. While some quick profits were booked in names like RingCentral (RNG) and Kennametal (KMT), there were some small losses as well, like Netflix (NFLX). But, as the market pulled back starting on Dec. 19 (5), two things occurred that were noteworthy. First, the pullback was very orderly and slow to give up its 10-day moving average. Second, several stocks set up, triggered buys and made progress during this time.Take Diamondback Energy (FANG). There were many constructive chart patterns forming among oil explorers and producers as the Nasdaq hit new highs. Diamondback Energy stood out because of its strong earnings record and relative strength. While the market pulled back slightly, it made significant progress.On Jan. 2 (6), the Nasdaq celebrated the New Year by starting a fantastic run of 8.4% the first few weeks. SwingTrader added names aggressively early on. The backdrop helped boost our confidence. Diamondback Energy was already up 7.8% from its entry by the start of the year. We also booked a few quick profits from stocks like Weight Watchers (WTW) and Mastec (MTZ) during the pullback. Whenever you start from a position of strength, you have the flexibility to push a little harder. We still employed profit-taking rules to nail down gains along the way up. The reversal on Jan. 16 (7), sparked some loss cutting and profit taking and on Jan 23. (8), another round of selling occurred, as the index seemed extended.The SwingTrader product has a list of every past trade. What is immediately recognizable is that strings of profits see intrusions of losses periodically in times of market weakness. Keeping that list overwhelmingly green requires more names in a favorable market and quick action when it isn't.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Recent swing trading articles on stocks noted above are available on Skechers, Illumina, RingCentral, and Diamondback Energy.Stock Market Follows Newton's Laws In Swing Trades Swing Trading Strategies And LessonsSwing Trading Webinar

21,URI,"To beat the stock market and mutual fund peers, having the right stocks isn't enough. It's having them at the right time that counts. And Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX) has done that in spades in the past 10 years and is doing so again this year.The fund, managed by Patrick Kelly since 2004 and Ankur Crawford since 2015, has cranked out an average annual gain of 10.55% in the 10 years since April 1, 2007, vs. 7.71% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 7.51% for the S&P 500. This year the $5.3 billion fund has raced ahead 11.04% vs. peers' 8.62% and the broad stock market's 6.07% gains.It's doing that thanks in large part to the double-digit gains notched by nearly 40% of its publicly traded stocks so far in 2017.Blue chip stocks, including a bevy of tech beauties, are a big part of Spectra's story right now. Top-10 holdings Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Visa (V) and Broadcom (AVGO) were all double-digit climbers, with returns ranging from Visa's 14% to Apple's nearly 25%.Other big gainers for the fund included Adobe Systems (ADBE), up 26%; Alibaba Group (BABA), whose ADRs were up 24%; and S&P Global (SPGI), up 21%.Through Monday afternoon, Amazon, Facebook, Broadcom and Alibaba were advancing yet again. The $4.78-billion market cap Cavium (CAVM), punching way above its weight class, was also rising — again. So was United Rentals (URI). Each was pushing back up near all-time high levels.Most of those stock market winners can also be found in Spectra's peers and the major stock indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. But it's the managers' handling of the fund's investment process that has made the performance difference.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. It has a solid 95 Composite Rating and four years in a row of earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' — including No. 4-rated Amazon.com — at IBD's Stock Checkup.Lead manager Kelly and Crawford, who advanced to her manager role after joining Alger as a research assistant in 2004, have notched their gains mainly by sticking to their investment approach, even when that means sidestepping sectors that have benefited from the ""Trump bump"" stock market rally.The crux of their approach is to seek growth stocks that are undergoing what they call ""positive dynamic change"" — high-unit-volume growth and positive life-cycle change.Kelly, 42 years old, and 41-year-old Crawford talked about their strategy and holdings with IBD from their offices in New York City.IBD: What does the positive-life-cycle-change part of your strategy mean?Kelly: In a positive life-cycle change, we're looking for earnings acceleration and multiple expansion driven by the positive change.IBD: How much of your portfolio consists of life-cycle change, how much consists of high-unit-volume growth?Crawford: About 10% of the portfolio is both, and the remainder is split half and half.IBD: Since the election, a lot of money managers have focused on playing sectors that they believe will benefit from Trump initiatives and a Republican Congress. However, with the failure to repeal or reform ObamaCare, many investors are concerned about the outlook for those policy moves. How are you playing this?Kelly: You highlighted one of the big market risks. Can the administration deliver on its promises? We're still optimistic that administration policies will be more supportive of U.S. business and GDP growth. With a lot of companies we've invested in, we're staying the course.IBD: Across the board?Crawford: The procyclical bias favoring materials is outside how we invest. With materials, we don't see a positive life-cycle change per se vs. a cycle to be played. In banks, however, there is much change. We expect they will benefit from lower regulation.We didn't take our industrials positions up dramatically because we worried about the very thing you're talking about, and industrials have given up some gains on those fears. However, in technology there are secular growth drivers that, regardless of policy, we expect will play out.IBD: The tech sector is your largest weighting. Why?Kelly: We continue to be big on trends in the internet, software and semiconductors. We believe tech will be a big beneficiary of trends in the mobile internet, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Big Data.IBD: What are some examples?Kelly: Amazon's Alexa (a voice-capable interactive personal assistant) is an AI device. It will prove disruptive to the retail sector.Apple is a life-cycle change company with a growing services business and an upcoming product-cycle services that should be an anchor that mutes the cyclicality of any product cycle.IBD: Is there also a potential Trump Trade boost for, say, Apple?Kelly: If tax repatriation takes place, Apple has $100 billion sitting (outside the U.S.) that would make them a beneficiary. It would either allow them to do a pretty significant buyback or, for companies that are legacy companies, it would give them the ability to positively life-cycle change. They can buy assets that let them turn their big ship around.IBD: Let me ask about some individual companies as of your latest disclosure. Do you like Alibaba because of any one part or do you like it because of its many parts together?Kelly: Our thesis is that Alibaba is one of the most dominant companies in the world. It's the dominant e-commerce platform in China. They also have leading positions in video, payments, logistics and cloud computing in China. We continue to believe platforms such as Alibaba and Amazon are extremely disruptive and underappreciated by the market.IBD: What has enabled earnings per share for Cavium (CAVM) to grow again after four quarters of declines?Crawford: For us, this is a classic unit-volume-growth story. They're a semiconductor company that will benefit from the upcoming 5G infrastructure upgrade. There will be a need to build faster data centers and to move to ARM-based servers (which are a category of reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, architectures for computer chips, which cut costs, heat and power use). Cavium has a complete portfolio of infrastructure IT to address the next generation of networks. These product cycles will drive content growth and market-share gains, which we expect will drive significant revenue and earnings accretion over the next three years.IBD: Any concern about Facebook's EPS growth slowing for two quarters in a row?Kelly: Internet advertising will experience rapid growth. And we expect Facebook to continue to take market share. It's also in the early stages of monetizing Instagram and its rapidly growing 600-million user base. Facebook has other medium- to long-term monetization levers, including Messenger, WhatsApp and their Oculus Rift platform.IBD: Netflix's (NFLX) quarterly EPS growth has accelerated. Any clouds on the horizon?Crawford: It's a transformative company that single-handedly changes the way we consume content. We are concerned that their free-cash-flow and earnings potential resides in the out years (in the future). They're able to get leverage only as they've seeded the global market.We see additional international penetration; the ability to increase pricing from the current offering of $10 a month in the U.S., which we believe is greatly underpriced for the value; and their ability to monetize their user base using creative advertising methods. We believe they can double their user base and revenues in the next five years.IBD: Broadcom has accelerated EPS growth for four quarters in a row. Are you comfortable they can keep this up?Crawford: They're one of the best examples of life-cycle change. They have a visionary CEO (Hock Tan), who via acquisitions and organic growth has driven earnings up ninefold over the last seven years. And we believe he's not done.Broadcom should continue to see further earnings accretion and now capital return to shareholders because it's generating $6.5 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow, which is about 30% of its revenue in free cash flow.IBD: Morgan Stanley has pulled back from its March high on investors' fears that corporate tax reform and lowering banks' regulatory burden is not the slam dunk many thought they would be. What's your thesis?Kelly: They've undergone significant change. Wealth management was only 5% of their business in 2006. Now it's roughly 50%. We believe that shift to a higher margin, less-capital-intensive business can drive return-on-equity expansion and multiple expansion. And financials in general should still benefit from regulatory relief and higher interest rates.IBD: Which of your strategic drivers does Adobe represent?Crawford: It's both a lifecycle-change and a high-unit-volume-growth company. And it is dominant in its market, and should have sustainable midteens revenue growth for the next three to five years, with over 20% earnings growth in that period.Digital advertising is the high-unit-volume-growth part of their business. They provide a platform that enables customers to deploy digital advertising.The life-cycle change is in the creative products part of the company, which has undergone a fast transition and is continuing to grow their total available market, as their products are adopted more broadly.And Adobe is adding more solutions, such as Fotolio, which is competitive with Shutterstock. It's a site where photographers can display their images and content-creator customers can use their images. It's a subscription type business, which allows for increased average selling price per customer.IBD: United Rentals (URI) has traded sideways near its all-time high since its January earnings report. Do you still like it?Kelly: It's one of the leading equipment rental companies in the U.S. Postelection, investors expected it to benefit from construction, from corporate tax reform and improving GDP growth. It (stalled) because there is uncertainty about the prospects for an infrastructure bill. If one passes, United would be a big beneficiary. Trump is also pro-energy, so a buildout of pipelines should benefit United.IBD: S&P Global (SPGI) has mostly gone sideways since Congress failed to repeal or reform ObamaCare. Is that a problem for S&P?Crawford: It's not a problem yet. S&P is another market dominant company. It is one of effectively two players in the ratings business, where they enjoy secular growth in debt issuance due to global economic growth and regulator constraints on banks. Combined with their information services business and their index business, 70% of their business is recurring.Adding to that, they are pruning their portfolio and using the proceeds to buy back shares.IBD: The fund's outperformance in the past 10 years got a boost from the fund's 56.52% gain in 2009. What worked so well for the fund that year?Kelly: We follow our philosophy and process in all markets to deliver strong long-term results for our clients. Looking at one year is not the lens we use to view the performance of the fund... (On the other hand, we) have had consistently strong performance over any three-year rolling period over the past 10 years. I think that is the better metric to focus on than any one year.IBD: What's your process for building positions in a stock?Kelly: Building positions depends on the stock and a variety of other factors. We continually assess risk-reward and look to rotate money into the names that we think have the most favorable risk-reward.IBD: You are active managers. Some people say active management at least in mutual funds is doomed. What do you think?Kelly: We're in a highly competitive market. You need to be able to drive good performance over a multiple-year period. We've been able to do that. That will continue to be our challenge going forward. We remain confident in our team and philosophy and process.RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersFidelity's Will Danoff Talks About The Super Bowl And Super StocksAdobe, Facebook, Other Stocks Drive One Of The Best Mutual Funds

33,URI,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

The $7 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, provides exposure to large-cap stocks with — you guessed it — low volatility. Shares are near a 45.79 flat-base buy point initially cleared Sept. 11.SPLV was featured in this ETF column July 13 as it found support at its 50-day line. It climbed 3% from the support line to a Sept. 12 intraday high. Before that, shares rose 5% from a May bounce off the 50-day.SPLV takes the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks and weights them so those with the lowest volatility get the biggest weighting. Financials made up the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25 at 21%; industrials were at 18%, utilities at 17% and consumer staples at 12.5%. Information technology represented 11%. Top names included Republic Services (RSG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).The fund has returned 12% YTD and averaged a 12.9% annual return over the past five years. It also bears a 0.25% expense ratio.SPHB is likely to outperform if the market takes off on the wings of high-beta growth stocks. SPLV is likely to do better if the stock market heads lower and low-volatility stocks fall less than high-octane growth stocks.Tuesday's picks, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), gave up some ground along with gold prices. Both held above their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:Apple Leads Dow; FANG Gains Fade; Did Gold Flash A Buy Signal?Apple, Techs Weigh On Stocks; Bitcoin Jumps; Time To Buy Gold?What An ETF For Extreme Stock Market Bulls Is Saying About Investors

219,URI,"The market for nonresidential construction in the U.S. may be heading for a sharp improvement over the next year based on trends ranging from architectural billings to steel demand, even though recent activity presents a mixed picture.The latest government data show that nonresidential construction spending dipped in August from a month earlier. Year-over-year it rose, though, and economists point to certain metrics that portend a further lift in spending in 2015.The expected increase applies not only to sectors that have already seen a rise in spending, such as retail and office, but also to sectors that have been in a slump, including education and health care.A variety of stocks could benefit from an uptick in nonresidential construction. These range from commercial/industrial construction companies such as Fluor (FLR) and KBR (KBR) to suppliers of construction equipment like United Rentals (URI), Terex (TEX) and Manitowoc (MTW) and steel producers like Nucor (NUE).One of the metrics analysts and economists are watching is the Architectural Billings Index, a measure of design activity and future construction that has reached multiyear highs in recent months.Architects Show OptimismOn Oct. 22, the American Institute of Architects reported that the September score was 55.2, up from 53.0 the month before and 53.8 a year earlier. It was the second-highest reading in over seven years, just behind July's reading of 55.8. A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. This typically leads to a rise in construction of nonresidential projects.Kermit Baker, the AIA's chief economist, says the third-quarter numbers ""are the strongest we've seen since before the downturn.""""Design activity is very highly correlated with construction activity,"" he told IBD, adding that it usually takes nine to 12 months to translate into land-clearing for construction.The lag means ""you might not see an immediate impact on steel demand,"" Morningstar steel-stocks analyst Andrew Lane told IBD. ""But it's another bullish indicator for the industry.""In its third-quarter earnings release, Charlotte, N.C.-based steel maker Nucor said its fabricated construction products businesses (rebar fabrication, joist and decking and pre-engineered metal buildings) spurred ""much stronger profits"" than in the second quarter.""This performance reflects improving conditions in the nonresidential construction markets,"" Nucor said, though those markets ""remain at historically low levels.""Most recent government nonresidential construction numbers show a market still struggling to find its footing after a prolonged downturn.Census Bureau data show that nonresidential construction spending in August fell 1.2% monthly but rose 6% vs. a year ago. September data are due Nov. 3.Seven of 16 nonresidential construction sectors saw spending rise in August. These included office, up 1.1% sequentially and 18.9% year-over-year; manufacturing, up 1.7% and 14.5%, respectively; and lodging, up 0.9% and 10.2%, respectively. Commercial construction, including retail, fell 3.1% on a monthly basis but rose 9.4% year-over-year.The uptick in office-related construction ""comes as no surprise,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry trade group. That's because job growth ""has accelerated, particularly in office-type jobs"" such as professional services.""Over the past year we've seen solid growth in office space-related construction, measured in dollar volume,"" Basu told IBD.Houston, Seattle And San JoseHe calls Houston, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., ""standout performers"" in this segment, thanks mainly to growth in energy (Houston) and tech (Seattle, San Jose) industries. The retail sector has benefited from ""interaction between expanding consumer expenditures and the need to protect market share from online retailers,"" Basu said.""One way for shopping centers to compete with online retail is to improve the shopping experience and convince people to get off their computers and actually go out to shop,"" he added. ""So you see shopping centers investing in the construction of grocery stores or movie theaters to lure people in.""Among sectors that saw a slowdown in construction spending in August were health care, down 0.6% monthly and 6.6% year-over-year; and education, down 2% monthly but up 1.9% year-over-year. The numbers should improve in coming months, observers say.Why Education Is ImportantThe AIA's Baker notes that there have been four straight months of gains in institutional billings, a sector that is mostly made up of education and health care but also includes cultural, religious, correctional and sports facilities.""That was the sector that had not recovered much, but there's a lot more confidence that we will see an upturn in institutional next year,"" Baker said. ""We are encouraged that there have been four months of upturn, and that the numbers have been accelerating.""A rise in construction of education facilities would provide a particularly big boost to nonresidential construction because it's one of the industry's biggest sectors.Education was hit hard by the recession and housing crisis. As property values fell, so did property taxes that finance construction of public schools. But as property values go up there will be more money to spend on schools.Another trend that may help educational facility construction comes from colleges and universities.""Many universities are trying to improve the standard of living in the wake of lower enrollment,"" Basu said. ""This has led to plans to improve the quality of both on- and off-campus housing.""Meanwhile, the health care sector might see a rise in construction as hospital operators grow more comfortable with ObamaCare.""Hospitals took a time out on major construction because they wanted to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act,"" Basu said. ""One of the positive aspects of the ACA is that the level of uncompensated care has fallen. All other things being equal, this improves the finances at hospitals. And anything that improves the finances improves the construction outlook.""

""So there's good pent-up demand.""Also, Zebra has continued to innovate, driving replacement demand.And Zebra is acquiring Motorola's (MSI) technology for reading bar codes via RFID chips. ""That gives Zebra the ability to close the loop and sell to a new customer base as well as existing customers,"" Aronow said.The fund started its current stake in the first quarter and boosted it in April and May.Early In CycleAronow likes the outlook for midcap construction-equipment renter United Rentals (URI).""It's showing improvements in utilization and pricing,"" Aronow said. ""And we're still early in the nonresidential construction recovery.""The company reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.65, up 47%, on July 16. ""That was a 20-cent upside surprise, showing strong business momentum,"" Aronow said. Its stock hit an all-time high of 114.95 the next day. It's up 43% this year.The firm came through the financial crisis well-financed, Aronow says, with a better fleet of equipment than its rivals. Those factors help to drive price and usage.The fund has trimmed its stake in recent disclosures, taking profits and managing risk, Aronow says.Midcap Akorn's (AKRX) EPS growth has accelerated for two quarters. Shares are up 38% this year.The maker of specialty drugs focused on ophthalmologic injectables has a pipeline that could lead to billions of dollars in new sales, Aronow says. He also likes the prospect of additional acquisitions.Aronow says that staffing firm Robert Half International (RHI), which Tuesday reported earnings and sales rose in Q2, is in good markets: finance, technology and accounting. Amid tightening demand in those markets, what Half charges customers rises faster than what Half pays its temps, Aronow says.And Half's sales efforts enable the firm's market share to grow faster than the market, he adds.Hampered earlier this year by large-cap and value outperformance, Aronow's fund was down 1.7% this year, going into Tuesday. Its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar averaged a 2.11% gain. The S&P 500 was up 7.97%.Over the past three years, the fund's average annual gain is 12.35% vs. 11.67% for its direct rivals and 16.17% for the S&P 500.

501,URI,"In some ways, United Rentals (URI) is well-positioned to profit from the current economic climate.A nervous recovery makes renting more attractive than buying.The equipment-rental company's past two quarters were strong. Earnings jumped 65% in Q2 and 47% in Q3 on revenue gains of 58% and 71%.The big earnings and revenue gains, though, were largely because of an acquisition. In April, United Rentals completed the acquisition of RSC Holdings.The merger involved the rental industry's two biggest players — United Rentals is No. 1 in market share and RSC is No. 2.As of March, United Rentals had 542 sites. RSC brought 440 locations. The merger, however, involved some closings. As of Q3, United Rentals reported 848 sites in the U.S. and Canada.While that boosted United's position as the top player, the resulting footprint isn't dominant. The equipment rental industry is highly fragmented. Market watchers estimate United Rentals' market share after the acquisition at 11%.The acquisition, though, wasn't entirely about size.""When you look at what we are doing, we said we're going to focus on diversifying our customer mix, our portfolio, and we've done that,"" CEO Michael Kneeland said at the October earnings call.RSC Holdings added revenue from the industrial segment, which is more stable than the commercial-construction segment that United relied on.Before the merger, United's industrial-tied revenue was about a sixth of its total revenue. Now industrial is more than a third.United Rentals has shaped a cup-with-handle base. The potential buy point is 43.22.However, buying stocks in a market correction is a low-probability action.

513,URI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) shares have rallied 54.7% in the past year, outperforming the 20% gain of the industry it belongs to. Being the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals enjoys strong brand recognition, enabling it to draw more customers and build customer loyalty.The price performance of the company is backed by an impressive earnings history. United Rentals surpassed earnings estimates consistently in eight of the past nine quarters. Moreover, earnings estimates have risen in the past few weeks, suggesting bullish sentiments on United Rentals.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose 2.4% and that of 2.6% for 2019. This bullish trend justifies the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes United Rentals a Solid Pick?Solid Growth Prospects: The company’s main strategy is to improve profitability by providing superior standard of service to customers, optimizing customer mix and fleet mix, strategic acquisitions to expand core equipment rental business, along with continued expansion of trench, power and pump footprint and tools offerings. In particular, United Rentals’ strategy calls for the implementation of Project XL, which is a set of eight specific work streams focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability via cost savings.The company has a robust earnings growth profile. The company’s earnings grew 23% per year on an average over the last three years (as of 2017). The company’s top line also increased 10% per year on an average over the same time period. The company has gradually increased its industrial exposure along with non-cyclical specialty acquaintance.United Rentals has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.53 per share for the current year, which is expected to grow 46.3% year over year (higher than the industry average of 29.3%). Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 13.9% in 2018, higher than the industry average of 4.6%.Expansion Via Acquisitions: United Rentals is expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. In March 2018, United Rentals acquired the assets of Industrial Rental Services, a leading U.S. provider of two-way radio solutions and industrial blinds, primarily in the Gulf and West Coast regions. The acquisition expands United Rentals’ Tool Solutions specialty rental fleet by more than 35,000 isolation blinds, flanges and racking systems for industrial applications as well as approximately 16,000 radios, repeaters and accessories for plant maintenance, and construction personnel.The two most important acquisitions made in 2017 were of Neff Corporation and NES Rentals. Neff Corporation enhanced the company’s earthmoving equipment and efficiencies of scale in key market areas. On the other hand, the acquisition of NES Rentals expanded United Rentals’ geographic footprint in key markets like East Coast, Gulf States and Midwest, and further established the company as an aerial supplier.United Rentals’ adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points year over year in the last reported quarter, as it continues to benefit from its integration of two sizable 2017 acquisitions, namely NES and Neff.Valuation Looks Rational: United Rentals has a Value Style Score of A, putting it in the top 20% of all the stocks we cover from this perspective.The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 13.9, below the industry’s average of 20.8x. This indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. Also, the company has a forward P/E ratio of 10.6, lower than the industry average of 17x, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term.Also, the company currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.5, below the industry average of 27.5x.Positive Construction Market: Demand for United Rentals’ products is largely related to the performance of the broader construction market. Per the latest report from the United States Department of Commerce, construction spending in April surged to its highest settlement since January 2016. This also marks its biggest increase since 2012. Per the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Commercial Construction Index, 93% of the total contracts in the country would witness a surge in profit margins by 2019.As such, demand for United Rentals’ products should increase as well, thereby driving its revenues. Also, the industry to which it belongs has a decent industry rank (among the top 12% out of 265 industries), signaling that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report).Century Communities sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 47%.Beazer Homes is a Zacks Rank #2 stock and its earnings for the current quarter are expected to grow 78.3%.Lennar carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 18.4%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

514,URI,"Per the latest report from the United States Department of Commerce, construction spending surged to its highest settlement since January 2016. This also marks its biggest increase since 2012. The construction market in the United States has been looking up for some time now. Per the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Commercial Construction Index, 93% of the total contracts in the country would witness a surge in profit margins by 2019.Further, broad-based factors like low levels of unemployment, strong job additions in the construction sector and positive consumer confidence have been instrumental in propelling the sector’s growth. Taking such factors into consideration, investing in stocks from the sector would fetch spectacular returns.U.S. Construction Activity Springs Back to LifeConstruction spending in the United States rose 1.8% in April compared to a slump of 1.7% in March. The seasonally adjusted spending rate of $1.31 trillion in April was about 7.6% higher than the same period a year ago. Also, the consensus estimate for the month of April was an increase of 0.8%.Such an increase was made possible by increased spending on private construction projects, which steadily rose to 2.8% in April. This marked its biggest increase since January 2012. Further, the outlays on private residential construction surged 4.5% to its highest settlement since November 1993. This followed a decline of 4.1% in the previous month.This apart, outlays on non-residential construction jumped 0.8% in April. Investment in public construction witnessed a decline in the month, falling 1.3% from an increase of 1.2% in March. Further, outlays on construction projects by the federal government fell sharply by 10.2% after increasing close to 2% in March.Steady Job Additions in Construction Per the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a total of 25,000 new jobs were added to the economy by the U.S. construction industry alone. Per the Associated Builders and Contractors’ (ABC) analysis of this data, approximately 286,000 jobs were added by the sector on a year-over-year basis. This marked its biggest increase since April 2016.Further, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also stated that in April, the construction industry offered an average weekly wage of $1,170.39, higher than the overall weekly average of $925.98.Moreover, unemployment rate in the sector declined about 2.1 percentage points to 4.4% in May. This marks its lowest level since July 2000. What also added to the gains was the fact that national unemployment rate plummeted to 3.8% in May — its lowest settlement since April 2000.5 Hot ChoicesWith construction spending rising to its highest levels in as many as 28 months, the space is poised to gain immensely in the days ahead. Not only did the sector hire more in April, it also offered steeper wages than the overall average. Further, Trump's business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and repeal of regulations have propelled the sector’s growth.The Zacks Construction sector is currently placed in the top 13% out of the 16 Zacks sectors. In this context, we have selected five stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These five stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

515,URI,"With erratic movements of major market indices last week, many analysts found it quite tricky to spot the prime factor behind the extreme volatility. Although The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% on Feb 9 after a wild week, fears of a downturn in the near future gripped the market.However, chances of a recession are negligible given record low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job additions. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings also acted as an antidote.Markets Bled Last WeekOn average, the Dow moved more than 1,000 points every day through the week. The market saw the index alter directions roughly 53 times, per The Wall Street Journal. Moreover, the weekly decline of 5.2% for the index was the steepest in more than two years.The encouraging wage growth data convinced investors of a probable spike in inflation, which might lead the central bank to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private sector workers witnessed 2.9% year-over-year wage growth in January, the highest since June 2009. The fear of impending inflation led the 10% drop in Dow from the record-high mark of Jan 26.  Chances of Recession Negligible Most analysts believe that the market was overdue for a correction and major indices might even plunge further, but that will not lead to a recession anytime soon. The signs of recession are normally reflected in indicators like GDP and employment data, and these parameters show no signs of a recession.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP might jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate of Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the US Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 U.S. jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1%, and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year-over-year in January 2017.Favorable Q4 Earnings Dispel FearsWe are almost at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season, with 341 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers and 159 yet to report. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for all S&P 500 companies will be up 14.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. The expected year-over-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter is way higher than the 6.7%, 11.2% and 13.5% growth rates for 3Q17, 2Q17 and 1Q17, respectively. Moreover, we expect the index’s earnings to increase to 15.7%, 17.5% and 18.1% in 1Q18, 2Q18 and 3Q18, respectively.Which Stocks to Focus On?Given the healthy expectations for earnings, most analysts believe that the market will not be unstable for long.Picking stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and VGM Score. Moreover, we have chosen firms with market capitalization of more than 10 billion, as large cap stocks are comparatively stable and less volatile.All the four stocks, with a VGM Score of A, sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) has a strong reefing presence. The refineries, where the company has operatorship interest, have a total daily capacity of 1.2 million barrels.The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 37.8%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 58% through 2018.Headquartered in Menomonee Falls, WI, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), with roughly 1,100 stores spreading across 49 states, is basically an omnichannel retailer.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 37.8%. We expect year-over-year earnings growth of 8.5% and 14.5% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, respectively.Headquartered in Findlay, OH, Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report) is a leading refiner of crude. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with average positive surprise of 182.6%.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for URI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.35 per share for URI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for URI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.24% heading into earnings season.United Rentals, Inc.

519,URI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, after market close.Synergies from the Neff Corporation acquisition are expected to reflect in fourth-quarter 2017 earnings. The company completed the buyout for approximately $1.3 billion last October. The buyout will enhance the company’s earthmoving equipment capabilities and efficiencies of scale in key markets. As part of the deal, United Rentals acquired approximately $860 million worth of fleet based on original equipment cost and 69 branch facilities. The company expects revenues from Neff in the fourth quarter of about $110 million, and EBITDA at around $55 million from Neff alone.Let’s delve deeper into other factors that are likely to affect the company’s Q4 earnings.In the third quarter, the company posted positive rental rates after eight straight quarters of negative rates. We expect the fourth-quarter results to reflect positive rental rates as well. Factors such as strong organic growth led by improving end-market demand and the NES acquisition are likely to help the company see an improvement in rates.Equipment Rentals, comprising about 86% of total revenues, is expected to get a boost in fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equipment Rentals revenues of $1.6 billion reflects sequential growth of 6.3% and year-over-year rise of 25.7%.The consensus estimate for rental equipment sales is $143 million, indicating an increase of 5.9% from the prior quarter. Again, sales of new equipment are expected to increase 12.5% on a year-over-year basis. Contractor Supplies revenues will likely witness 6.8% growth and Service and Other revenues are expected to rise 18.3%.Project XL initiatives, prudent investments in fleet, accretive acquisitions and robust market demand enhance United Rentals’ prospects.Moreover, the company has been experiencing growing demand in its core construction and industrial sectors. Commercial construction has been strong of late. Upstream oil and gas is also gaining traction on improving macro conditions. Thus, demand for United Rentals’ products is expected to increase, thereby driving revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1.88 billion in the said quarter, up 23.3% from the year-ago quarter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 earnings has improved in the last 30 days. Estimates for the fourth quarter moved up 0.9% to $3.34. The consensus mark for 2017 depicts an increase of 4 cents to $10.60.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 25.1% and 22.5%, respectively.United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Rentals, Inc. Quote What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that United Rentals is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

521,URI,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Rayonier (RYN  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.9% over the past month. RYN hit a new 52-week high of $39.16 in the previous session. Rayonier has gained 23.4% since the start of the year compared to the -6.6% move for the Construction sector and the 6.2% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Rayonier reported EPS of $0.31 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.16 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.45%.For the current fiscal year, Rayonier is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share on $774.4 million in revenues. This represents a 10.77% change in EPS on a -3.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.74 per share on $807.25 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.74% and 4.24%, respectively.Valuation MetricsRayonier may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for RYN? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Rayonier has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 54X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.9X versus its peer group's average of 11.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 10.8. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Rayonier Inc. Price and Consensus Rayonier Inc. Price and Consensus | Rayonier Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Rayonier currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Rayonier passes the test. Thus, it seems as though RYN shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Rayonier Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Rayonier have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Louisiana-Pacific (LPX  -  Free Report), Armstrong World Industries (AWI  -  Free Report), and United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 6% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RYN, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregtae VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise URI has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

523,URI," Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) recently announced the purchase of more than 450 lots across three new home communities in Myrtle Beach and four in Raleigh. The assets were purchased from Bill Clark Homes, a leading private homebuilder in the Carolinas.The deal is valued at approximately $29 million and the company funded it through available cash.Significant Top and Bottom-Line Contributions  The acquired communities will be incorporated into Beazer’s existing operations in Myrtle Beach and Raleigh and are expected to start contributing immediately to profits and return on assets, without increasing leverage.In fiscal 2018, these acquired properties are likely to contribute significantly to Beazer’s revenues and adjusted EBITDA.The Larger PictureThe acquisition is part of the company’s plan to drive capital intensive growth. There are three main factors in this investing strategy.First, Beazer is accelerating acquisition of gatherings sites and age-restricted condominium communities. Second, the company’s traditional community acquisition activities are focused on delivering extraordinary value at an affordable price. Third, Beazer will spend more on land development, including about $60 million on formerly land held assets.These activities are expected to drive community count in fiscal 2019 and 2020.Stock Price MovementBeazer’s shares have gained more than 39.6% in the last six months, surpassing 30.4% growth of its industry. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 130.5%. Meanwhile, estimates for the current year and next have been stable over the last 30 days.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBeazer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are United Rentals, Inc.

524,URI,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) has witnessed a dismal price trend so far in 2017. The company’s shares have lost 5% as against the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates Industry's growth of 0.1%. Also, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has underperformed the industry in each of 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Abnormal weather conditions in many markets are affecting Martin Marietta’s operations. The company’s businesses are subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profits. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe drought can jeopardize shipments, production and operations in all markets. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast is most active during the third and fourth quarters.The recent hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — disrupted the company’s operations, caused short-term dislocations and work stoppages in August and September.During the third quarter, volume growth in the Mid-America Group was affected by heavy precipitation while Southeast Group’s shipments were unaffected. Volumes also declined due to  project delays. Infrastructure volume growth declined during the quarter due to weather-related woes and delay in ongoing projects.  Let’s take a look at some more factors affecting the stock.Earnings Miss and Downward Estimate Revisions: The company’s lackluster bottom-line performance in the last reported quarters disappointed investors. Earnings of $2.39 missed estimates by 4%. Moreover, the company lagged estimates in the last four quarters with an average miss of 2.01%.Again, Martin Marietta has witnessed current-quarter earnings estimates decline 17.3% over the past 60 days, on the back of two downward revisions against none upwards. The same for the current year fell 5.3% due to three downward revisions versus none in the opposite direction. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is expected to grow 4%, less than the industry’s projected growth of 12%. Also, earnings estimates for 2018 declined 7.6% in the same time frame.Guidance Cut: The company expects net sales in the range of $3.64-$3.74 billion, lower than the previous range of $3.75-$3.95 billion. Aggregates Product line net sales are projected in the range of $2.1-$2.16 billion (lower than the previous range of $2.2-$2.3 billion). Aggregates product line volume is expected in the range of -1-1%, down from the previous expectation of 4-5.5%.Cement Product Line net sales are estimated in the range of $365-$375 million, down from the previous range of $380-$400 million. Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt/Paving Product Lines net sales are projected in the band of $1.27-$1.31 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.3-$1.4 billion.Overvalued Compared to Peers: Martin Marietta has a Value Style Score of D, pushing it into the bottom 40% of all stocks we cover from this perspective.Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the company currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.7, higher than the S&P 500 index’s average of 21.4x. Also, the stock is relatively overvalued compared with its peers as the industry average is pegged at 23.9x.Looking at the company’s sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.3, higher than the industry average of 1.1. Some prefer this metric more than other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.An often overlooked ratio is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into consideration, but can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business. Martin Marietta has a P/CF of 18.3, higher than the industry’s average of 10.7.All these ratios show that the company is overvalued compared with industry peers and thus it not a good time to place a bet on the stock.Negative Industry Outlook: The industry has underperformed the broader market over a year. Currently, the industry ranks among the bottom 8% (243 out of 265 industries). Along with dismal performance of the industry in the past, a poor rank signals that the stock is likely to be affected by unfavorable broader factors in the immediate future.Moreover, tightened labor markets, in both the public and private sectors has led to project delays and hinder significant growth in construction activity. Martin Marietta blames the state departments of transportation of being understaffed, which is limiting the number of new projects stemming from the additional infrastructure funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act and other state and local initiatives.Therefore, similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. As both the share price and estimates are falling for Martin Marietta, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc (AWI  -  Free Report). All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

526,URI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, United Rentals has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts United Rentals’ current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.1) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that United Rentals has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for United Rentals’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, United Rentals has a P/S ratio of about 2.0. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, United Rentals currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes URI a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for United Rentals is just 0.6, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 0.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.1, which is slightly better than the industry average of 10.5. Clearly, URI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though United Rentals might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives URI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B.

"
528,URI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire BakerCorp. International Holdings Inc. for $715 million. The all-cash deal, slated to close in third-quarter 2018, will give a significant boost to United Rentals’ specialty rental business in North America as well as enable it to foray into some European markets.United Rentals’ shares closed Monday at $144.75, down nearly 2% from Friday’s closing price.Buyout SynergiesBakerCorp, which has been in business for more than 75 years, is a leading provider of tank, pump, filtration, and trench shoring rental equipment for industrial and construction applications. It has more than 4,800 customers in North America and Europe. The company’s rental fleet consists of more than 24,000 units, including steel and polyethylene tanks, roll-off boxes, pumps, pipes, hoses and fittings, filtration units, tank trailers, berms, and trench shoring equipment.United Rentals, the world’s largest equipment rental company with 1,002 rental locations in 49 states and Canada, expects the deal to create major opportunities for revenue growth, and customer service through cross-selling, re-rent conversion and scale. BakerCorp generated $79 million of adjusted EBITDA on $295 million of revenues for the 12 months ended May 31.BakerCorp primarily operates in the United States and Canada, where it has 46 locations. Additionally, it has 11 locations in France, Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands. BakerCorp’s international operations, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenues for the fiscal ended Jan 31, 2018, will provide United Rentals an opportunity to enter into select European markets for the rental of fluid solutions.Meanwhile, the combined entity is also expected to create about $19 million in direct cost synergies across corporate overhead and shared services.United Rentals anticipates the integration to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share with an attractive internal rate of return and run-rate ROIC exceeding cost of capital within 36 months after closing. The company expects its net leverage ratio to be about 2.5x at 2018-end. Meanwhile, it remains focused on its recently announced $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization.United Rentals’ Systematic Inorganic Efforts Bode WellUnited Rentals follows a robust expansion strategy via acquisitions and joint ventures. In March 2018, United Rentals acquired the assets of Industrial Rental Services — a leading U.S. provider of two-way radio solutions and industrial blinds, primarily in the Gulf and West Coast regions. The acquisition expands United Rentals’ Tool Solutions specialty rental fleet by more than 35,000 isolation blinds, flanges and racking systems for industrial applications, as well as approximately 16,000 radios, repeaters and accessories for plant maintenance, and construction personnel.Again, the two most important acquisitions made in 2017 were of Neff Corporation and NES Rentals. Neff enhanced the company’s earthmoving equipment and efficiencies of scale in the key market areas. On the other hand, the acquisition of NES Rentals expanded United Rentals’ geographic footprint in key markets like East Coast, Gulf States and Midwest, and further established the company as an aerial supplier.Price Performance and Zacks RankUnited Rentals’ shares have declined 16.7% in the past three months, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 0.6% growth. Declining rental rates are marring its prospects. However, the company’s foremost strategy to improve profitability of the core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies will eventually reflect in its share price performance in the near term. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings per share is expected to increase 45.9% year over year.United Rentals currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (WMS  -  Free Report), Aegion Corporation (AEGN  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Advanced Drainage Systems’ current-quarter earnings are expected to increase 44.4%.Aegion and Armstrong World Industries’ full-year earnings are likely to increase 34% and 22.9%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

529,URI,"Manufacturing and construction activity boomed last month, and the summer often means even more spending. So let’s take a look at three construction and manufacturing sector stocks that are strong buys at the moment.The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index popped to 58.7 in May up from 57.3 in April, which topped economists’ expectations of 58.4. Last month marked the 21st straight month of manufacturing expansion.U.S. construction spending also surged 1.8% to a record high in April, the biggest increase since January 2016, according to the Commerce Department. These gains were due in part to the 4.5% jump in residential construction, the biggest percentage gain since November 1993.With all that said, let’s take a look at three stocks from the manufacturing and construction sector that investors should think about buying right now.1. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report)Right off the bat, Caterpillar stock looks pretty darn cheap at the moment. Coming into Friday, CAT was trading at 13.6X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500’s 17.3X. Meanwhile, investors should note that Caterpillar stock has traded as high as 32.6X over the last two years, with a two-year median of 22.6X—with CAT currently trading just above it two-year low of 13X.Meanwhile, our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Caterpillar’s quarterly revenues to surge by 21.5% to touch $13.77 billion. At the other end of the income statement, CAT’s adjusted earnings are projected to skyrocket nearly 78% to hit $2.65 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by roughly 56%. Investors should also note that CAT has received 11 upward earnings estimate revisions for its full-year, all within the last 60 days, against zero downgrades. Caterpillar stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sits well below its 52-week high.2. United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report)United Rentals, which, as its name suggests, rents an array of industrial and construction equipment, has seen its stock price climb roughly 54% over the last year. URI is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. United Rentals stock is currently trading at 10X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which comes in far below its industry’s average of 16.7X.Looking ahead, United Rentals revenues are projected to climb by 12.8% this quarter to hit $1.8 billion, while its full-year revenues are expected to surge nearly 14% to reach $7.56 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s bottom line expansion projections look more impressive. United Rental’s quarterly earnings are expected to hit $3.53 per share and its full-year EPS figure is projected to touch $15.49, which would represent year over year gains of roughly 49% and 46%, respectively.3. Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report)Shares of Terex have been trending in the wrong direction lately, but its earnings revisions are headed in the right direction. The lifting and material processing products company has earned 10 full-year upward earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days, against zero downward revisions. Terex’s adjusted full-year earnings are projected to soar by 114.81% to touch $2.90 per share. The company’s current quarter EPS figure is projected to climb by 76% to touch $0.90 per share. On the top of the income statement, Terex’s quarterly revenues are expected to pop over 18% to $1.40 billion, while its full-year revenues are projected to climb 16% to touch $5.06 billion.TEX is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. Lastly, TEX’s valuation picture looks solid right now. Going into Friday, TEX was trading at 12.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, representing a discount compared to its industry’s 16.4X average. Furthermore, TEX has traded as high as 29.7X over the last year and currently rests right above its 52-week low of 12.2X.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

530,URI,"As we bid adieu to 2017, let’s take a look at how the construction sector fared this year and what’s in store for 2018.Overall, 2017 was a great year for the construction sector buoyed by robust gains from home building investments and a rebounding U.S. economy. Especially, optimism surrounding the construction sector grew manifold post President Donald Trump’s victory, since one of his key priorities was driving infrastructure investments. This optimism is likely to continue in the near term, thanks to the long-awaited tax cuts, which are likely to be passed this week.In total, spending on construction increased 4.1% year over year in the first 10 months of the year, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Although spending on government projects declined 3.4% year to date, it grew 3% in October, the biggest one-month gain in three years, with spending at the federal, state and local levels rising. Government project spend is expected to increase in 2018 with the Trump administration’s $1-trillion infrastructure spend program, which is yet to materialize. On the other hand, residential spending increased 6.6% in the first 10 months of 2017. While a few projects like multifamily housing are gradually losing ground, others like office buildings, education facilities, and transportation terminals are in high demand.Insights Into the Sector’s Prospects for 2018U.S. construction starts are expected to climb slightly in 2018, according to Dodge Data & Analytics’ 2018 Dodge Construction Outlook. A 3% increase to $765 billion is expected, following a similarly modest 4% rise to $746 billion, is estimated for 2017.The forecast further entails 3% increase in public works construction spending, higher than 1% growth in 2017. Highways and bridges projects are likely to get a boost as federal funding is rising owing to the FAST Act. Again, reconstruction efforts related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma are also adding to the expectations.Also, residential construction activities stepped up this year and the trend is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs. Per the study by Dodge Data & Analytics, 4% gain is expected for residential building, 2% for nonresidential building, while nonbuilding construction is expected to stabilize following two years of decline.However, a few market pundits are of the opinion that the Trump administration’s efforts toward overhauling the tax code could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market and make housing less attractive. The GOP tax bill allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million.That said, the December reading of the confidence level of homebuilders speaks of the industry’s strength. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.Builders seem to be shaking off worries related to the Republican tax plan, and apparently believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives. The legislation promises many practical changes in a number of areas, but it will surely have a major positive impact on corporate profitability.Per the Zacks Earnings Trends, earnings for the construction sector are likely to witness 20.3% growth in 2018, up from the expected 14.9% increase in 2017. Revenues are likely to improve 9% in 2018, compared with 9.5% growth estimated for 2017.Strong Economy and Labor Market Act as CatalystTrump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. Both markets and investors responded positively to this. The aura exists, as is evident from the broader market’s performance.The S&P 500 index topped the milestone of 2,500 for the first time in mid-September, surpassing the 266% rise during the 1949-56 run, per Bloomberg. Notably, the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma, depicting strong complacency in the stock market. Again, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved up 5,000 points this year — the biggest annual gain in its history — and is moving closer to another major milestone of 25,000.The world’s largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter (2nd estimate), marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and up from the second quarter's 3.1%. Again, further decline in unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the construction sector. The November figure came in the lowest since December 2000.All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow more than 24% this year, higher than the broader market’s (S&P 500) rally of 20.1%. We note that the construction sector has been a major contributor to the S&P 500’s growth story.Investing in the Construction sector might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 31% (5 out of 16 sectors) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.5 Construction Stocks that Outpaced the MarketWe bring five construction stocks that not only outpaced the market (S&P 500) in 2017 but also are expected to outperform in the coming years.

531,URI,"Increasing demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products bode well for Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report). Along with it, cost-saving initiatives and divestures at regular intervals to accelerate growth are expected to drive profits.Key Growth DriversGiven the housing end market’s steady improvement, there is an increasing demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price range. The momentum is expected to continue which in turn will improve demand for Masco’s products. Rising housing prices are also giving a boost to consumer confidence in home investments.More than 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. Masco’s growth in the last few quarters has mostly been driven by steadily growing repair and remodel activity.The positive momentum is evident from the company’s results in the first nine months of 2017. The company’s net sales increased 3.1% driven by solid contribution from its Plumbing Products (up 5%) and Decorative Architectural Products (up 4%) segments. Strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution led to a 3% increase in North American sales in the first nine months of 2017.Notably, the company’s Plumbing Products segment continues to be strong, particularly in North America, as it gained market share with its high-end showroom products and saw strong growth in eCommerce sales across both pure-play online retailers and omni channel partners.Overall, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its market leading brands. It is one of the leading cabinet manufacturers in the United States and holds one of the largest shares in faucets. Its popular brands include KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint, and Milgard windows.Apart from strong demand, Masco’s effective cost-saving initiatives help it in boosting profit level that include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions. Masco’s adjusted gross profit increased 5.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017 and gross margin expanded 80 basis points over the time period. Operating margin increased 40 bps, on an adjusted basis, over the said period.Again, Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas in a bid to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.Although the recent hurricanes have negatively impacted the last reported quarter, delaying deliveries and installation schedules, Masco’s prospects remain bright given the expectations of continued momentum in housing industry banking on improving economy, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Masco’s shares have gained 26.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 17.7%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have remained stable over the last seven days.Nevertheless, increasing demand for repair and remodeling and new product launches are key growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Patrick Industries, Inc.

534,URI,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018) results on May 8, before the market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 11.40% over the last four quarters. Notably, Jacobs’ fiscal first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.Our proven model shows that the company will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Jacobs has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.34%. This is because the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents is a penny lower than the Most Accurate estimate.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Jacobs’ favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive Earnings ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 or at least 3 (Hold), for a likely earnings beat.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Stellar Earnings?Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and some major emerging economies, like China, is expected to spur demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services over the long run.Though no specific financial guidance has been provided for the fiscal second quarter, Jacobs’ expectation for the fiscal will give a rough idea of the factors that might have influenced results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects that elevated defense spending in major economies like the United States, new organic investments, bolt-on acquisitions, superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for state-of-the-art technology solutions will boost revenues of Aerospace & Technology line of business (LOB).Additionally, increasing public investments in worldwide transportation and water infrastructure, as well as business prospects in the healthcare market are anticipated to drive top-line performance of the company’s Buildings & Infrastructure LOB in the near term.Moreover, the company believes revenues of its Industrial LOB will go up in the upcoming quarters, on the back of improved life science, semiconductor, and mining & minerals businesses.Furthermore, amid the lackluster energy market, Jacobs expects that efforts to strengthen its downstream chemicals and refining business will likely drive revenues of the company's Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.Stellar top-line performance of the aforementioned segments, greater cost management, restructuring moves, reduced corporate taxes and timely project delivery are expected to have reinforced the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Construction sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%.

537,URI,"The construction market in the United States has been looking up for some time now. Per the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Commercial Construction Index, 93% of the total contracts in the country would witness a surge in profit margins by 2019. The space has also gained immensely from a steadily developing office real estate market.Further, broad-based factors like a rise in GDP, low levels of unemployment and strong job additions and positive consumer confidence have been instrumental in propelling the sector’s growth. Investors looking to bet on construction stocks should wait no further as this is the right time to realize maximum gains from the space.A Healthy Office Real Estate MarketOffice development in the country has witnessed a boom in the recent past. High employment levels have resulted in an increase in the pipeline of office construction projects. Per a report from Knight Frank and JLL, about 11.1 million square feet of new office development took place in first quarter of 2018. Further, the report states that approximately 84.2 million square feet is under development.If records are anything to go by, total office construction currently makes up 1.7% of total existing inventory. Further, factors like increased public spending, lower tax rates, upbeat wage rates and reduced trade deficits are bound to foster U.S. GDP growth in the future. In return, a sturdier economic growth will augment aggregate construction spending in the United States.Sturdy Job Additions in the SectorAccording to the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, job openings increased from 6.1 million to 6.6 million in March. This is the highest level recorded since the survey was first conducted in December 2000. Notably, the construction industry added 68,000 more workers to the economy, becoming one of the few industries to have created the maximum number of jobs.Strong Earnings in Q1Growth is very strong in Q1, but that was no surprise for the market. Importantly, the growth picture for the current and coming quarters is effectively the same as before the start of this earnings season.Net margins are expected to increase 1.4 percentage points from the year-earlier period, with Finance, Technology, Industrials, Energy, and Construction driving most of the margin gains. For the first quarter, construction sector earnings were up 47.3% from the same period last year on 20.3% higher revenues. (A Critical Look at the Q1 Earnings Season)All the construction companies have reported their earnings for the last quarter and the showing has been exuberant. The earnings and revenue beat ratio stand at 69.2% and 84.6%, respectively.4 Hot ChoicesA burgeoning office construction market, sturdy job growth in the sector and a robust economy have been instrumental in boosting gains for the space. Further, Trump's business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and repeal of regulations have propelled the sector’s growth.The Zacks Construction sector is currently placed in the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors.

538,URI,"Shares of Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) have gained more than 69% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.7% growth of its industry. Additionally, this Toledo, OH-based world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.After all, the overall outlook for the U.S construction sector remains positive with healthy economy, strong job market and historically low mortgage rates that will continue to drive stocks higher.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both the fourth quarter and the current year have increased 5.2% and 0.9%, respectively, in the last 30 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.What Makes Owens Corning a Solid Pick?Stellar Performance: Last month, Owens Corning came up with robust quarterly results, with the company’s earnings and revenues increasing 12% and 15.7%, respectively. Even in the first nine months of 2017, the company’s adjusted earnings improved 13.4% on 11.3% year over year growth in net sales. The robust performance was due to the solid contribution from its three segments, namely, Composites, Insulation and Roofing.Notably, its Roofing segment, accounting for more than 40% of its revenues, registered 16.5% growth in sales over the time frame, reflecting strong shingle and component volumes, ongoing strong reroof demand and stepped up activity. Year-to-date pricing gain continues to offset the impact of asphalt inflation. In the first nine months of 2017, industry shingle shipments were up about 7% driven primarily by storm activity and replacement demand.We remain optimistic about the company’s prospects given favorable end-market trends from housing and residential repair/remodel spending, good incremental margins in the composites and insulation businesses, and strong margins in the roofing business.Paroc Group Acquisition: Late last month, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Paroc Group (from CVC Capital Partners), a leading European manufacturer of building and technical mineral wool insulation. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2018, which should be accretive to 2018 EPS, with more meaningful gains expected in 2019 post synergies.The Paroc acquisition will expand Owens Corning’s mineral wool technology portfolio, enhance its presence in the European insulation market, provide access to a variety of new end-use markets and will boost the Insulation sales mix outside the United States and Canada to 35%.Apart from Paroc, Owens Corning completed the $560 million acquisition of Pittsburgh Corning in June. The buyout of Pittsburgh Corning will further expand Owens Corning's commercial and industrial product offerings and expand its presence in Europe and Asia.Owens Corning is expanding into commercial and industrial markets with the acquisition of Pittsburgh Corning as well as Paroc. These buyouts will boost revenues outside the United States, thereby helping its bottom line as well.Solid Estimated EPS Growth: The company’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to increase 41.5% year over year. The company’s EPS is expected to grow 19.2% for the current year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 7.2%.In 2018, Owens Corning is expected to come up a stellar performance with its bottom line expected to grow 18.3%, almost in line with the industry’s expected 18.1% growth rate.Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 8.8% in the current quarter and 10.6% for the current year. For 2018, the company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 7.2%. Hence, Owens Corning makes a great pick in terms of growth investment supported by a Growth Score of B.Solid VGM Score: The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) make solid investment choices.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like Patrick Industries, Inc.

539,URI,"On Jun 14, we issued an updated research report on Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report). The company’s results will be aided by strong repair and remodel activity, as well as the continuation of positive new building construction activity. Further, focus on restructuring activities, investment in new products and the Tectum acquisition is anticipated to drive growth. Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail. Volumes to Boost Top Line For 2018, Armstrong World projects net sales growth in the range of 5-7% aided by a modest upturn in volume, average unit value (AUV) improvement in Mineral Fiber segment and continued double-digit sales gains in the Architectural Specialties segment. Driven by sales gain, productivity improvements in plants and impact of announced restructuring activities aiding the bottom line, the company expects EBITDA improvement more than 10% for the year. The company’s EPS guidance is in the range of $3.60-$3.82, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19-27%. The company’s results will also be aided by strong repair and remodel activity, as well as the continuation of positive new building construction activity. Investment in Product Launches to Reap Benefits The company has been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. Armstrong World’s launch of Sustain, in the spring of 2017,  was a major step in reinforcing its presence in the Mineral Fiber category. Further, the introduction of Total Acoustics in 2016 has strengthened the company’s leadership position at the high-end of the Mineral Fiber segment. These launches have witnessed extraordinary rates of adoption by architects, and the company anticipates the penetration of these products to continue through 2018 and beyond. Restructuring Efforts to Fuel Margins In 2017, Armstrong World took steps to optimize manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure. In November, the company announced its intention to close the St. Helens plant and open a distribution center near Phoenix in order to provide better service to its West Coast customers. It has also planned to restructure the G&A profile to serve an Americas-focused business. These actions will yield cost savings in the range of $15-$20 million by the end of 2019. Further, these will propel EBITDA growth in the second half of 2018 and the company anticipates delivering $400 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2019. Acquisitions to Augment Growth The company recently acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. The buyout bolstered Armstrong World’s interior accent capabilities. In January 2017, the company concluded the buyout of Tectum, which accelerated its penetration into specialty ceilings and walls. Throughout the year, its team integrated Tectum into the Armstrong platform, and the results have exceeded expectations. Now having fully integrated the business, the company can begin making modest capital investments to further enhance capabilities and profitability in this product line. Moreover, continued sales leverage and capital investments at Tectum will enable its Architectural Specialty business to expand margins in 2018 and beyond. Share Price Performance  Armstrong World has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has appreciated around 42.7%, while the industry has recorded growth of 19.1%. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider Armstrong World carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. (SSD  -  Free Report). While Patrick Industries and United Rentals sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Simpson Manufacturing carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Patrick Industries has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.7%.

The company’s shares have appreciated 56% during the past year. Simpson Manufacturing has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. Its shares have rallied 52%, over the past year. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

541,URI,"Investors with an interest in Building Products - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report) and Installed Building Products (IBP  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both United Rentals and Installed Building Products are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.96, while IBP has a forward P/E of 22.42. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IBP currently has a PEG ratio of 0.75.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 4.64. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IBP has a P/B of 10.45.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to URI's Value grade of A and IBP's Value grade of C.Both URI and IBP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that URI is the superior value option right now.

543,URI,"Vulcan Materials Company’s (VMC  -  Free Report) bolt-on acquisitions, strong aggregate reserve position and improvement in private construction activities are encouraging.The company follows a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions. The company has closed acquisitions totaling $212 million so far this year.In the first quarter of 2017, the company took over facilities, a marine aggregates distribution yard and building materials yards in California. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, it acquired an aggregates facility, asphalt mix operations, an asphalt paving business and a rail-served aggregates operation. In the second quarter of 2017, the company signed an agreement with SPO Partners to buy the latter’s aggregates business — Aggregates USA LLC. These buyouts expand its ability to serve customers well and bring in operational and commercial synergies. In 2016, Vulcan expanded its aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas.Moreover, an improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well as sustained growth in private construction activity drives demand for aggregates as well as non-aggregates businesses of Vulcan Materials.     Positives like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector’s performance. As such, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products should rise as well, thereby driving revenues.Also, a strong aggregates business is a major positive for Vulcan Materials. The company is the largest producer of construction aggregates in the United States, possessing the largest proven and probable reserve base in the country. Importantly, the aggregates industry is characterized by high barriers to entry as there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates, thus placing Vulcan Materials favorably.Inclement Weather HurtsSeasonal influences on construction activity weigh heavily on the company’s performance. Inclement weather conditions affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute products as its production and distribution facilities are located outdoors.In the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results. Operations in key Southeastern markets, particularly Florida and Georgia, as well as coastal markets in Texas and along the central Gulf Coast were disrupted.  Aggregates shipments were lowered by at least 1.5 million tons during the quarter. Apart from the immediate impact of the storms, labor market disruptions, haul truck shortages and other logistical challenges continue to trouble.

545,URI,"On Dec 19, we issued an updated research report on NCI Building Systems, Inc. (NCS  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from its encouraging outlook, focus on growth strategy around insulated metal panels (IMP), and investments in automation and process innovation. However, additional charges related to restructuring and volatile steel prices are expected to thwart results.Upbeat ViewFor first-quarter fiscal 2018, NCI Building estimates revenues to be in the range of $390-$410 million, reflecting 2% year-over-year growth at the mid-point. The company projects its adjusted EBITDA to be in the $24-$34 million range in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. It anticipates gross margins to improve in fiscal 2018 driven by a solid cost structure. The company expects to see a strong fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.IMP Sales to Drive GrowthNCI Building’s focus on growth strategy around IMP and its ability to drive adjacent products across the engines of legacy distribution channels will support the company’s performance.  It expects the IMP product lines to improve at a low double-digit rate in fiscal 2018 based on solid underlying demand. Further, NCI Building anticipates low-rise non-residential construction starts in the fiscal year to grow in mid-single digits, with the adjustable markets for legacy businesses projected to be up in the range of 2-4%.Investments to Boost ResultsNotably, NCI Building is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of rising demand for key products and strategic actions. The company is focused on investments in automation and process innovation which will slash operating costs, improve margins, quality and service, and enhance operational flexibility. It will also focus on continued improvement in manufacturing, and delivering further cost reductions with the Lean and Six Sigma initiatives across the entire business. The step will reduce excess operational back-office costs and simplify the business.Additional Charges to Mar ProfitOver the last several years, NCI Building has incurred various charges related to cost restructuring and disposal of idle or non-core assets. The company expects to record continued activity in these areas and incur additional charges during fiscal 2018. It will continue to recognize these items separately in the reporting of operating results each quarter, which will impact margins and profitability.Steel Prices Remain a ConcernNCI Building’s volumes were adversely affected by a rapid escalation in steel prices over the last two years. Even though the company has successfully passed through higher steel-input costs in fiscal 2017, volatile steel prices might impede its performance in fiscal 2018.Share Price PerformanceNCI Building has underperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 19.7%, while the industry has recorded growth of 20.4% during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNCI Building currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc.

546,URI,"Shares of Quanex Building Products Corporation (NX  -  Free Report) crafted a fresh 52-week high of $24.05 on Dec 14, eventually closing lower at $23.80. An encouraging outlook for fiscal 2018 drove the company’s share-price performance.The company has a market cap of $829.2 million.

Further, Quanex Building has an impressive VGM Score of B. In this, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score eliminates the negative aspects of stocks and selects winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3, offer the best investment opportunities.Quanex Building Products Corporation Price and Consensus  Quanex Building Products Corporation Price and Consensus | Quanex Building Products Corporation QuoteWhat Led to the 52-Week High?On Dec 11, Quanex Building posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings dropped 17.8% year over year due to lower volumes and short-term inefficiencies related to transitioning away from its less profitable wood-flooring business. Recent hurricanes in the United States also affected earnings in the quarter. In addition, revenues fell 6.5% year over year in the quarter.Despite posting disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results, Quanex Building anticipates elevated demand for its products in the coming quarters as rebuilding efforts remain on track. The company also remains well positioned for growth and margin expansion in the near future.  Notably, Quanex Building expects to generate net sales in the range of $890-$900 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting growth of 4.5% at the mid-point compared to fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to lie in the band of $103-$108 million.  The company will continue to invest in automation across all divisions, with a continued focus on the North American Cabinet Components segment. It expects capital expenditure will be between $25 million and $30 million for the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report), Patrick Industries, Inc.

548,URI,"U.S. GDP growth for the first three months of this year was reportedly the highest for any first quarter since 2015. At full employment, the economy is presently showcasing remarkable strength in both business and consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve is also anticipated to announce additional rate hikes this year, taking cues from a tight labor market scenario and a fiscal stimulus plan by the Trump administration.A sign of robust economic momentum will likely bolster infrastructure spending in the United States. Against this backdrop, allocating your hard-earned money in selective construction stocks can prove to be a masterstroke.Better-Than-Expected GrowthLast Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revealed that GDP growth rate was 2.3% for the January-March quarter, better than the 2% gain predicted by Wall Street analysts.In the last four quarters, GDP growth rate averaged 2.9%, almost in line with 3% growth predicted by the Trump administration. However, the American economy slightly slowed in the three months ended March, on account of decelerated growth in consumer spending and “seasonal quirks”. It largely stemmed from seasonal amendment issues, relating to how BEA factors in abnormal changes in the U.S. economic activity. Nevertheless, the setback is presumed to be momentary against the milieu of heavy fiscal stimulus and stretched labor market conditions.The economy’s aggregate productivity of goods and services topped expectations in the first quarter, sustaining hopes of a solid recoil for the rest of the year.Trump’s ImpetusThe first-quarter GDP reading is not a spot-on reflection of the U.S. economy; as the full impact of increased government spending and tax cuts has not yet materialized. Consumer spending growth braked at 1.1% in the first quarter due to delayed tax deferrals. The December Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bill was effectual in January and did not show in employees’ paychecks until late first quarter.However, we notice that government spending advanced at a 1.2% rate in the January-March session and is expected to gain momentum from the second quarter, on the back of increased public expenditure lately approved by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. President’s promise of a $1.5-trillion fiscal stimulus program is likely to provide a lot of economic juice in the next couple of years.The slowdown in first-quarter consumer spending was largely offset by 6.1% growth in corporate investment, reflecting upside in business inventory rebuilding and gains in oil and gas exploration. Investments of nonresidential structures also surged 12.3% in the quarter.Moreover, on Friday, Trump highlighted a fresh section of his economic program, relating to America’s trade deficits with other major economies like Germany. A slight dip in deficit balance added 0.2% points to first-quarter GDP growth and is likely to support more gains going forward due to Trump’s focus on “fair” trade practices.  Fed ExpectationsThe Federal Reserve will likely shrug-off the repercussion of a tepid GDP growth rate in the first quarter. The Mar 20-21 minutes session revealed that policymakers ""expected that the first-quarter softness would be transitory,"" on account of ""residual seasonality in the data, and more generally to strong economic fundamentals.""The Fed has lifted interest rates to 1.75% last month and will possibly execute additional hikes this year to curb unwanted inflation in the economy. The U.S. economy is at its full employment and a stretched labor market will eventually push up inflation; as employers are trying to brave workforce shortages with higher wages. Notably, a report released on Friday disclosed that wages of U.S. private sector employees went up by 1% in the first quarter, marking the biggest quarterly rise in the last 11 years.How to Play the MarketIncreased public spending, lower tax rates, upbeat wage rates and reduced trade deficits will likely foster U.S. GDP growth in the future. Sturdier economic growth will augment aggregate construction spending in the United States. Per the Census Bureau, U.S. construction spending rose 4.4% year over year to $176.3 billion in the first two months of this year.The Zacks Construction sector is currently placed at the top 19% out of the 16 Zacks sectors.Per the latest Earnings Preview report, earnings and revenues of all construction stocks in the benchmark index will likely climb 46.7% and 17.3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.In order to cash in on the solid growth potential of the sector, we have handpicked five construction stocks that will likely add a sparkle to your portfolio.These companies carry a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and currently flaunt an attractive VGM Score  of A or B.

550,URI,"The construction sector witnessed a dynamic 2017. Rising residential demand along with a rebounding U.S. economy eased political and economic challenges.The Year So FarThe construction sector has demonstrated stability through 2017 and witnessed sustainable growth amid various challenges. It goes without saying that President Donald Trump was the biggest factor. Investors were expecting faster growth based on Trump’s assurance of significant tax cuts, higher infrastructure spending and lesser regulations.Although the momentum slowed a bit later, the S&P 500 index topped the milestone of 2,500 for the first time on mid-September, surpassing the 266% rise during the 1949-56 run, per Bloomberg. Notably, the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma, depicting strong complacency in the stock market.Although public construction declined in 2017, it can get back into the positive territory with expansions in terminals and runways, airport construction, as well as with public education construction spending. On the other hand, residential spending increased 6.6% in the first 10 months of 2017, reinstating its stature, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau.So far, it has been a good 2017 for the housing market and the trend is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs. Consumer Confidence, a key determinant of the economy’s health, improved significantly in November, reaching its highest level in 17 years. Again, there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials, a generation that had to some extent refrained from entering the market.Despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected. The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter, marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a nice pickup from the second quarter's 3.1%. Notably, it is the first time since 2014 that the U.S. economy has witnessed growth of 3% or more for two straight quarters.Will Supply Shortage & Labor Hurdles Restrain the Positive Momentum?What is plaguing the industry of late is the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and the upward pressure it is creating on prices in several parts of the country. Housing affordability fell in the third quarter of 2017, according to a National Association of Home Builders or NAHB survey. Meanwhile, labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the companies’ margins.Nonetheless, economists are of the opinion that the rebounding U.S. economy accompanied by low level of unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the sector as a whole. November figure was the lowest since December 2000. The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months, the longest streak.All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow nearly 23.3% this year, higher than the broader market’s (S&P 500) rally of 19.3%. Notably, investing in the Construction sector might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 6% (1 out of 16 sectors) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Keeping the positive momentum in mind, here are eight construction stocks that more than doubled the S&P 500 YTD and will continue to outperform in the coming months given that these have potentially superior weighting methodologies and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Sterling Construction Company, Inc. (STRL  -  Free Report) – Up 112.1%Sterling along with its subsidiaries, operates as a heavy civil construction company in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, California, Hawaii, and other states in the United States. It carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last two years, the company has successfully turned around, and dramatically improved its balance sheet and overall financial health. Thus, the company is well positioned to generate substantial earnings growth in the future. Looking beyond 2017, the company expects to benefit from a steady stream of heavy civil project opportunities across its geographies as well as its residential business. The company’s earnings are expected to increase 211.3% for the current year and 119.1% for the next.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) – Up 102.4%NVR is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings. NVR has delivered stellar performance so far this year, driven largely by its disciplined business model, focus on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 15% to $3.42 billion.Also, the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 11.4% and 0.1%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2017 from 2016 levels. The uptick can be attributed to favorable market conditions in 2017, which led to a higher sales absorption rate on a year-over-year basis.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a long-term (three-five years) expected EPS growth rate of 17%.

553,URI,"Aegion Corporation (AEGN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, Aegion posted negative earnings surprise of 13.04%. In fact, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The company has a negative average earnings surprise history of 3.57% in the past four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Aegion Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Aegion Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Aegion Corporation QuoteKey Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aegion’s earnings per share is pegged at 12 cents for the first quarter, underlining roughly 33% year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $299 million also indicates nearly 8% drop from the prior-year quarter.Notably, Aegion’s first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year due to lower construction activities in many parts of its business due to adverse weather conditions. Extremely cold temperatures in the first six weeks of 2018 impacted some of Aegion’s business in the United States and Canadian operations, which remains a major headwind for the quarter to be reported.Moreover, customer work releases are slower at the start of the year. Additionally, results might have been impacted by absence of the large deepwater project which had a strong contribution in the first two quarters of 2017. However, strong backlog, along with continued strength in key markets, as well as the company’s focus on restructuring actions remain catalysts for growth.Meanwhile, Aegion’s Corrosion Protection segment will be buoyed by focus on improved project execution and labor utilization. However, rising energy and labor costs might have affected the segment’s margin performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s net sales is pegged at $93 million for the quarter to be reported, down more than 24% from $123 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Our consensus estimates indicate that sales of Aegion’s Infrastructure Solutions segment will reach $132 million in the quarter, reflecting around 2.3% year-over-year growth. Benefits from further penetration into the pressure pipe market on the back of new product development, investments in underserved North America CIPP (cured-in-place pipe) regions and improved product sales are expected to reflect in the segment’s results.Further, we expect quarterly sales for the Energy services segment to be $76 million, up around 4% year over year. The segment is anticipated to mainly grow on restructuring efforts. However, restructuring charges and cost inflation remain concerns.Aegion’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year, affected by the prevalent headwinds. The stock has lost around 0.5% compared to nearly 7% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aegion is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 10 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents, is -13.04%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aegion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Continental Building Products, Inc.

556,URI,"Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) has been exhibiting robust performance on less competition in the luxury new home market as well as solid housing demand.Though Toll Brothers’ shares have underperformed the Zacks Homebuilding Industry so far this year, it has outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Meanwhile, estimates for the current quarter and year have moved up 6.3% and 0.3% over the last 60 days, suggesting analyst optimism on the stock’s performance.Toll Brothers missed analysts’ expectations on both earnings and revenues in the recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. However, earnings increased 72.6%, while revenues were up 9% year over year, given the higher number of homes delivered.Deliveries increased 9% in units, while contracts surged 20% in dollars and 15% in units on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter marked the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in contract dollars and units. However, average price of homes delivered remained almost flat year over year during the quarter.  PositivesLess competition in the luxury new home market proves beneficial for Toll Brothers. The company mostly caters to luxury move up buyers, who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, Toll Brothers enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, resulting in increased home deliveries, earnings and revenue backlog growth. In 2017, total revenues increased 12% year over year to $5.82 billion. Deliveries totaled 7,151 units, up 17%. Earnings came in at $3.17 per share, up 45.4% year over year.Moreover, given the pent-up housing demand, Toll Brothers has secured some of the most sought-after urban locations in the country, where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to obtain. In November 2016, Toll Brothers acquired Coleman Homes in Boise, ID, that involved the takeover of approximately 1,400 owned lots, 350 controlled lots and the immediate addition of 15 selling communities to its community count. Through this acquisition, Toll Brothers expanded its footprint, mainly in Western United States.Also, the outlook for the U.S. homebuilding industry is quite compelling, given the affordable interest rates and tight inventory indicating pent-up demand. Moreover, the latest positive housing data reassures the industry’s strength, courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is driving momentum.ConcernsA shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor, escalating land prices and higher material costs are exerting pressure on margins of Toll Brothers as well as other homebuilders. In fact, Toll Brothers’ adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points (bps) in fiscal 2017.Additionally, the company believes that home sale prices will decline and have an adverse year-over-year impact on adjusted gross margin, which adds to the woes.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderToll Brothers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc (AWI  -  Free Report).United Rentals sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

557,URI,"Shares of Aegion Corporation (AEGN  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. The global leader in infrastructure protection and maintenance has witnessed its shares surge around 27.2% in the past three months. The company has also outperformed its industry's growth of 11.9%.Aegion has a market cap of roughly $877 million and average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 212K. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.05% in the trailing four quarters.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores (Value - B, Growth - A, Momentum - B). Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A along with some other key metrics makes the company a solid choice for investors.Let's take a look into the factors that are driving the Aegion stock of late.Driving FactorsInvestors are optimistic on Aegion’s strategic actions focused on generation of more predictable and sustainable long-term earnings growth. Within the infrastructure solutions platform, the company is likely to focus on restructuring three businesses — Tyfo Fibrwrap North America operations, and CIPP (cured-in-place-pipe) operations in both Denmark and Australia. The CIPP businesses in Denmark and Australia along with Fyfe North America are intended to be supplemental growth drivers to the core North America CIPP operations. Consequently, the company is trying aggressively to return these three businesses to profitability in early 2018.Aegion chose to exit the non-pipe contract application of its Tyfo Fibrwrap technology due to smaller project scopes.

558,URI,"PulteGroup Inc.’s (PHM  -  Free Report) prudent investments in new land positions will continue to result in higher volumes, revenues and profits. The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate inventory turns.In the first nine months of 2017, the company spent $773 million in land acquisition. PulteGroup is on track to spend approximately $1.1 billion on land acquisition and $1.6 billion on land development (up around 10%) in 2017.Apart from prudent land investments, the company is adopting initiative to improve its operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. These initiatives have helped drive profits. Earnings in the quarter increased a solid 40% from the year-ago level. The upside was supported by higher demand despite disruptions caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma.As part of its cost-reduction program, PulteGroup made significant workforce reductions and curtailed overhead costs and inventory. Moreover, aggressive debt repayment due to an improved financial position has lowered its interest costs. In addition, PulteGroup’s strategic pricing programs allow buyers to select the lots and options that they value the most, resulting in higher levels of house options and lot premiums. The company is also adjusting contents of its homes and is building smaller floor plans to curtail construction costs.Also, the latest positive housing data reassures the industry’s strength, courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is driving the momentum.In fact, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has gained 66.9% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain of 17.6%. Moreover, a good industry rank (top 26% out of more than 256 industries) signals that the companies in this space are likely to benefit from broader factors in the near term.ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages while land prices are on the rise owing to limited availability. This is denting homebuilders’ margins. Home sales’ gross margin decreased 80 basis points year over year to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2017.PulteGroup’s homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Natural disasters and inclement weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials and dent demand for new homes.Share Price MovementShares of PulteGroup have gained 85.7% year to date, outperforming 67.8% gain of the industry it belongs to. The price performance has been backed by an impressive earnings history. PulteGroup surpassed earnings in all of the past four quarters, the average beat being 8.09%.  Though earnings estimates for 2017 declined 3.5%, it increased 2.2% for 2018 over the last 60 days. This indicates analysts’ apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future but the stock’s growth story might impress over the long term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are Patrick Industries, Inc.

559,URI,"Shares of United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) have rallied 49.4% so far this year, outperforming the 19.8% gain of the industry it belongs to. Also, the company has outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.The price performance is backed by an impressive earnings history. United Rentals surpassed earnings estimates consistently over the past seven quarters. Moreover, earnings estimates have risen in the past few weeks, suggesting bullish sentiments on United Rentals.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings rose 7.5% and 13.9% for 2018. This bullish trend justifies the stock’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).United Rentals enjoys strong brand recognition, which enables it to draw customers and enhance customer loyalty. The company offers approximately 3,200 classes of rental equipment for rent on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.Furthermore, the return on equity delivered in the trailing 12 months is 44.8%, while the industry returned 10.8%, reflecting the company’s efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.This equipment rental company, with a market cap of $12.6 billion, has strengths in several key areas. Thus, adding the stock to your portfolio seems prudent.Solid ProspectsUnited Rentals’ main strategy is to drive profits at its core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, the company’s strategy calls for the implementation of Project XL, which is a set of eight specific work streams focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability through cost savings. Also, United Rentals is focused on expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. In October 2017, the company acquired Neff Corporation which will enhance United Rentals’ earthmoving equipments capabilities and efficiencies of scale in key market areas.In August 2017, United Rentals bought power equipment assets from Cummins Inc., which is expected to help United Rentals cash in on the strong demand for power solutions in North America. The acquisition of NES Rentals Holdings II, Inc. in April is expected to strengthen relationships in the construction and industrial sectors and leverage United Rentals’ technology and infrastructure.Notably, earnings in 2017 are expected to grow 22.1%, way higher than the industry’s projected growth of 7.2%. Additionally, the company’s sales growth in 2017 is projected at around 14.1% compared with the industry’s 0.6%.Valuation Looks RationalUnited Rentals has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this perspective.The company currently has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 15.9, below the industry’s average of 19.7x.

The overall outlook for the construction market is positive. Factors like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer sentiments raise optimism over the sector’s performance. As such, demand for United Rentals’ products should increase as well, thereby driving revenues. The Zacks Construction sector has rallied 19.8% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 16.7%.Also, the industry to which it belongs has a decent industry rank (among the top 45% out of 265 industries), signaling that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.VGM ScoreUnited Rentals has a VGM Score of B.

560,URI,"On Nov 28, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report) crafted a 52-week high of $59.05 during intra-day trading, finally closing lower at $59.00.Armstrong World has a market cap of $3.1 billion. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 456.2K. Investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s focus on transformation plans, improvement in AUV and innovation in products.The stock has gained 41.4% in a year’s time, higher than the S&P 500’s gain of 18.7%. Armstrong World has also outperformed the industry’s gain of 19.9% with respect to share price movement during the same time frame.What's Driving Armstrong World?Recently, Armstrong World signed a definitive agreement to divest its EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and Pacific Rim businesses, in a bid to focus on investment and innovation in high-end mineral fiber manufacturing as well as expand capabilities in Architectural Specialties. The divestment is a significant step of an ongoing transformation plan.Armstrong World expects the divestment to complete in mid-2018 and will realize around $250 million of net cash following the deal’s accomplishment. Moreover, this move will enable the company to focus on resources of its core Americas ceilings and walls businesses.Armstrong World remains focused on improving sales dollars per unit sold, or average unit value (AUV). Over the past three quarters, it implemented price increases for ceiling tile, and grid products in the Americas and EMEA. The company will announce further pricing actions depending on movements in raw material prices or foreign currency valuations. Further, its innovative and latest product enhancements will drive AUV through better mix and better like-for-like pricing.Notably, Armstrong World’s high-performance ceiling system portfolio, which includes the recently-launched Total Acoustics and Sustain families, displays its endeavor to offer innovative product to customers.Backed by these factors, Armstrong World raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.80-$2.90 per share, reflecting 24% year-over-year growth at the mid-point. Further, year-over-year sales growth is estimated in the 6-9% range, translating to total sales of $1.31-$1.34 billion. The company expects to benefit from pent-up demand following the hurricanes, a strong order backlog and improving construction market.Upward Estimate RevisionsFurthermore, Armstrong World’s positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Armstrong World moved up over the past month, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. The earnings estimate for 2017 has gone up 2.2%, while that of 2018 inched up 0.7%.Armstrong World Industries Inc Price and Consensus  Armstrong World Industries Inc Price and Consensus | Armstrong World Industries Inc QuoteThe above-mentioned tailwinds have raised investors’ optimism on the stock and are anticipated to boost the company’s share price in the days ahead.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Patrick Industries, Inc.

561,URI,"The U.S. housing industry appears to be back on track after a few sluggish months, indicating gradual recovery on strong demand. Americans bought new homes in October at the fastest pace in a decade, reflecting the underlying strength of the economy.October Housing DataPer the latest report from the Commerce Department, new-home sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October. This marks the second straight monthly gain, scaling their highest level in 10 years. Northeast and Midwest witnessed maximum increase, while the South and West registered less gains.October sales figure increased 18.7% from a year ago and 6.2% from the prior month. It is to be noted that September’s sales pace was revised down to 645,000 units from the previously reported 667,000 units.The recent increase in new home sales in the U.S. homebuilding and sales of previously owned homes suggests that the market is regaining momentum after hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily stalled activity (read more: Existing Home Sales Rise in October: Will the Rally Last?).However, the industry has been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. The inventory of new homes on the market was 282,000 units. It would take just 4.9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market. Limited land availability is driving prices higher, as average sales price of a new home jumped 13.6% year over year and 5% from the prior month to $400,200.Nonetheless, housing/homebuilding has been on a high in recent times on solid home sales data, affordable interest/mortgage rates and impressive housing starts figure. Resilient job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence are adding to the momentum.New residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October, reinstating strength in the housing industry. Per the latest jointly released report by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, constructions for new homes increased 13.7% in October 2017 to 1.29 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month. This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single-family homes and apartments.Again, confidence among homebuilders increased in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession (July 2005), according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.Keeping in mind the positive momentum, we zero in on some housing stocks that have gained in the current scenario and have the potential to rise further before mortgage rates start rising.Winning StocksWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we narrowed down the list four stocks in the Construction sector based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is one of the leading national homebuilders. The company remains committed toward achieving continued double-digit annual growth in both revenues and pre-tax profits, while generating positive cash flow and improved returns.D.R. Horton’s shares have returned 81% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s 63.6% rally. Estimates have moved north in the last 30 days for the current as well as for the next year by 2.6% and 8.2%, respectively. This bullish analysts’ sentiment justifies the stock’s current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting the company to outperform in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company is also expected to witness earnings growth of 17.3% for the current year, more than the industry average of 15.3%. The stock has a VGM Score of A.Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) is a Toledo, OH-based world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. Its shares have gained more than 70% year to date, substantially outperforming its industry.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both the current year and the next have increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the last 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1. The company is also expected to witness earnings growth of 19.2% for the current year and 18.3% for 2018.Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report) is a producer of wood-based panels with operations primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada. The company’s shares have returned 38% year to date, outperforming the industry. Estimates have moved north in the last 60 days for the current as well as for the next year by 20.8% and 12.7%, respectively. The company, with a Zacks Rank #1, is expected to witness a robust earnings growth of 122.9% for 2017.United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) is one of North America's largest equipment rental companies. The stock also sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its shares have increased 45.2% so far this year, outperforming the industry.Also, estimates have moved north in the last 60 days for the current as well as for the next year by 7.5% and 14%, respectively. The company, with a solid ROE of 44.8%, is also expected to witness earnings growth of 22.1% for 2017 and 17.3% for 2018.Last, we picked NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), involved in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has climbed more than 100% year to date, outperforming the broader industry. Estimates have moved north in the last 60 days for the current as well as for the next year by 5.6% and 8.6%, respectively.The company is also expected to witness earnings growth of 41.3% for the current year and 13.9% for 2018. The stock’s rock solid trailing 12-month Return on Equity (ROE) ratio of 38.2%, compared with the industry average of 10.6%, indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to its peer group.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

But most investors fail at this first step. Stocks are one of the few things that people do NOT buy when they go on sale.2.    Remember Buffett’s first and second rules of investing and apply them when you buy.Watch debt levels. Keep your portfolio diversified and forget the noise.3.    Buy the earnings.There’s a reason value investors buy companies with low P/E ratios.4.    Buy when insiders buy.If the stock is at multi-year lows, wouldn’t the insiders want to dive in and buy?5.    Dig deeper into the fundamentals.Watch for fraud stories or media articles about a company’s character. Avoid value traps by buying companies with earnings growth. Listen to conference calls to find out what’s really going on with the business.And, most importantly of all, a value investor must have patience. Value stocks don’t turn around overnight.Screening for Value Stocks to Buy NowTracey ran a screen using a low P/E and she looked for earnings growth.She also added the Zacks Rank and only looked at those with #1 (Strong Buy) ranks. That means that the earnings estimates are likely on the rise.The screen gave her 29 stocks.3 Value Stocks with Earnings Growth1.     United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 14.1.

565,URI,"U.S. stocks managed to arrest a two-day slide on Monday, even managing to close the session with meager gains. Though Monday’s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news, investors will continue to wait for further progress on the new tax policy.However, experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely. Further, the era of low interest rates which had fueled much of the markets’ gains is coming to an end worldwide with central banks rolling back their easy money policies.Given this background, constant warnings about the exorbitant valuations of U.S. stocks may not seem as unrealistic as they did before. Some of these are rather bleak, going so far as to predict a decade long period of losses. However, the uncertainty created by the hurdles to the tax reform process and upcoming rate hikes means that it would make for a smart move to shore up your portfolios with some great value stock picks.Investors Remain Uneasy About Tax Cut ProspectsThe first weekly decline in two months was triggered on Nov 9 by the introduction of the Senate Republicans’ version of a tax cut legislation that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year. Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump’s ability to pass laws, leading the Dow to snap a seven-session streak of gains which itself was a product of tax cut hopes.Of course, the market does have other catalysts and Monday’s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news. But investors will continue to await further progress on the new tax policy. However, experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely.Further, the version of the legislation introduced by the Senate Republicans is widely different from the one introduced in the House. This is likely to lead to several rounds of negotiations which in turn would raise market volatility. Central Banks Prepare to Wind down StimulusAn end to the monetary stimulus packages which central banks across the world have put in place is another factor which will soon come into play. Markets have been boosted by an extended phase of soft interest rates over several years now and their gradual removal can only reduce the level of impetus they enjoy. While the Fed prepares to raise rates in December, the ECB will begin slashing the level of its bond purchases from this month.One section of market watchers believe that U.S. investors have already come to terms with such a move. But given the events of the past week, a rate hike at this time could make things tougher for stocks. The Fed and the ECB are only likely to tighten monetary conditions further going ahead, which makes it imperative for investors to choose their stocks carefully.U.S. Valuations Already at Record LevelOver the last few months, investors have received several warnings about the pricey nature of U.S. stocks. The latest of these comes from John Hussman who claims that valuations for U.S. stocks have already hit an all-time high. Using his valuation metric of choice, the ratio of market capitalization to gross value added, Grossman claims that stocks are pricier than they were in 2000 and 1929, years which heralded unprecedented market downturns.Hussman believes that overstretched valuations, caused by an almost 300% Bull Run, will lead to a market drop of almost 63%. This would then lead to an entire decade of losses for the bourses. The underlying reason for the crash would be the prevailing belief among investors that only risky assets can provide good returns.Such a feeling has become popular during an extended period of extremely low interest rates, thinks Hussman. While most market watchers would characterize such dire conclusions as a tad extreme, they would be hard put to dismiss them outright, given the events dampening investor sentiment in the recent past.Our ChoicesConcerns about the ability of the Trump administration to push through tax cuts have been weighing on stocks recently. Even though markets have edged up during the last trading session, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.Further, central banks across the world are preparing to wind down monetary stimulus measures.

567,URI,"Driehaus strategy is one of the favored approaches for investors with high-risk appetite. Using this strategy, investors pick momentum stocks in the hope of attractive returns. Richard Driehaus, the pioneer of momentum investing, prepared this strategy using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. The success of the investing strategy helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

568,URI,"The massive rise of companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) helps highlight the rapid expansion of growth-obsessed investing. Yet, at a time when many investors target lofty growth—sometimes in favor of most other metrics—value investing can still be just as powerful as ever.Value investors tend to target stocks that can be purchased at a discount relative to many of the company’s industry peers. United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) is a company currently positioned in this value-focused category.United Rentals is currently the largest equipment rental provider in North America. The company has almost 1,000 branches, where it rents its often-large equipment to construction companies, industrial firms, utilities companies, government agencies, municipalities, and other entities. The equipment rental giant currently boasts about 11% market share in North America.Shares of United Rentals have skyrocketed almost 85% in the last year and currently rest just below their all-time high. On top of that, United Rentals is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy) and sports an overall VGM grade of “A.”In terms of valuation, United Rentals also rocks an “A” for Value in our Style Scores system.United Rentals, Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) United Rentals, Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) | United Rentals, Inc. QuoteOne of the first things that many value minded investors look at is a company’s price to earnings ratio. United Rentals is currently trading at just 13.64x earnings, which marks a big discount compared to its industry’s 19.87 P/E ratio, as well as the S&P 500 average. URI’s 1.92 P/S ratio is also solid, although it falls below its industry’s average.Along with these traditional valuation metrics, United Rentals has an earnings yield of 7.34%, which tops the industry’s 4.98% average. What’s more, URI’s price to cash flow ratio of 6.14 is far better than the “Building Products – Miscellaneous” industry’s 11.95 average.It seems clear that United Rentals presents strong value for investors. When coupled with its current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its “A” VGM grade, URI might be a stock that value-minded investors should consider.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

569,URI,"Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) soared to a new all-time high on Tuesday after the company reported better than expected third-quarter results and upbeat fourth-quarter guidance, pulling much of the construction and equipment industry—including Thor Industries (THO  -  Free Report) and United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report)—up as well.Caterpillar topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues. The company’s revenues jumped 25% from the year-ago period to $11.41 billion, while earnings crushed expectations and skyrocketed year-over-year (also read: Caterpillar's (CAT  -  Free Report) Cost Discipline Drives Q3 Earnings Beat).On top of that, the Peoria, Illinois-based company upped its full-year guidance. Caterpillar now expects to post revenues of $44 billion, up from a previous range of between $42 and $44 billion. This comes as welcome news to shareholders and potential investors, as the manufacturing powerhouse reported revenues of $38.54 billion last year, which marked its fourth consecutive year of declining sales.Caterpillar grew revenues and bolstered its bottom line in its third-quarter thanks to sales growth from all three of its business sectors, as well as a commitment to cutting costs. The company’s three main businesses—Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation— all experienced revenue growth in every global region Caterpillar operates in.The company cited gains in its construction-related businesses in China, along with onshore oil and gas in North American, as well as an overall jump in capital investments from mining companies, as some of the biggest reasons for the jump in revenue.“Higher sales volume and our team’s focus on cost discipline resulted in improved profit margins across our three primary segments,” Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement.In terms of earnings guidance, Caterpillar raised its projection from around $5 per share to $6.25 per share. What’s more, the manufacturing equipment power announced it would also raise prices early next year.Caterpillar’s shares popped over 7% in early morning trading to touch a new all-time intraday trading high of $140.44 per share. Since then, the stock has cooled off a bit and now hovers around 4.5% above Monday’s closing price.Shares of other construction, mining machinery, and manufacturing companies gained on the back of Caterpillar’s big quarterly beats and upbeat in full-year guidance.Other Stocks Caterpillar’s rise helped renew investors’ confidence, which led some infrastructure ETFs to pop. Shares of the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Const ETF (PKB  -  Free Report) and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) both jumped nearly 1.0%, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) experienced marginal gains.Other infrastructure, mining, and manufacturing companies also experienced gains on Tuesday. Shares of Thor Industries climbed over 1.30%, while United Rentals stock popped by over 2.20%. Gibraltar Industries (ROCK  -  Free Report), Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), and Deere & Company (DE) stock all gained as well.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

572,URI,"NCI Building Systems Inc. (NCS  -  Free Report) has observed negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and current year. It has also witnessed a price decline in the past six months. The company’s current quarter results are anticipated to bear the impact of Hurricane Harvey as well as lower volumes in the legacy Components segment due to lingering weak markets.For the current quarter, NCI Building Systems has seen one downward estimate revision compared with no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 28 cents a share from 32 cents over the past 60 days — a drop of 13%.For fiscal 2017 and 2018, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 60 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 to trend lower, going from 80 cents a share to current level of 78 cents.In the past year, the stock has also underperformed the industry it belongs to. Its share price has dipped 2.0%, against the industry’s rise of 20.9%.Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be the right time to get rid of the security before more losses affect your portfolio.Let’s delve deeper to find out other reasons why it might not be wise to keep NCI Building Systems stock in your portfolio anymore, at least not in the near term.Unfavorable Zacks Rank, Score: NCI Building Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores (Value - B, Growth - A, Momentum - B). Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Near-term Headwinds: NCI Building Systems’ results in the fourth quarter will be hampered by potential temporary disruptions at customer job sites due to Hurricane Harvey, which may affect ongoing projects or ability in the short term to accept deliveries. Further, lower volumes in the legacy Components segment due to continued weak market activity remains a concern.The company expects to fully implement its plans to enhance cost efficiency, along with optimizing combined manufacturing footprint in phases and estimates incurring future additional restructuring charges associated with these plans. These charges will affect profitability in the near term.While leading indicators continue to point to year-over-year growth for low-rise non-residential starts of 3-6%, the company has witnessed a divergence in growth rates of extremely large low-rise structures over 500,000 square feet versus smaller structures within the 2017 year-to-date numbers. The company’s legacy businesses tend to focus more on these smaller structures less than 500,000 square feet, which are growing at a slightly slower rate. The company expects, based on current backlog activity and leading indicators, low to moderate growth at the lower end of the 3-6% range over the next 12 months for its legacy businesses if this divergence persists.Expensive Valuation: NCI Building System’ trailing 12-month price earnings (P/E) ratio is 21.84, while the industry's average trailing 12-month P/E ratio is lower at 19.42. This implies that the stock is overvalued.Lower Margins than Industry: NCI Building System’s net margin for the trailing 12-months is 3.1%, way behind the industry’s 8.2%.Stocks to ConsiderFor investors keen on the industry, one may instead consider a better-ranked stocks, Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report).Owens Corning has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.3% and its share price has soared 65% in the past year. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Rentals, another Zacks Rank #1 stock, has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 18.5%.

It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, United Rentals has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, United Rentals’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that United Rentals has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for United Rentals stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, United Rentals has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, United Rentals currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes USG Corporation a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though United Rentals might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B. This gives URI a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher compared to one lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as both the current quarter and full year consensus estimate has jumped 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:United Rentals, Inc. Price and Consensus   United Rentals, Inc. Price and Consensus | United Rentals, Inc. Quote This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineUnited Rentals is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 21% of more than 250 industries) it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in United Rentals.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The company continues to make progress with its industry-leading technologies and estimates e-commerce sales to touch $1 billion this year.Watsco, Inc. Price and Consensus  Watsco, Inc. Price and Consensus | Watsco, Inc. Quote Notably, Watsco is continuing to catch up with the digital revolution by investing in scalable platforms for mobile apps, e-commerce, business intelligence and supply-chain optimization. The company’s technology evolution continues to make progress. It maintained its annual run rate for technology spending at $23 million.Watsco’s balance sheet remains conservative, with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio under 1x.

Watsco expects to deliver on its stated goal of cash flow exceeding net income gains this year. It will also consider increasing dividends at the beginning of the next year.Further, Watsco has immense growth potential in the replacement market, attributed to an aging stock of air conditioners and heating systems in the United States.

577,URI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report), the largest equipment rental company in the world, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, 2017, after market close.We expect the company’s rental revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter after eight consecutive quarters of negative rental rates. Factors such as strong organic growth led by improving end-market demand, NES acquisition as well as hurricane Harvey and Irma related rental work are likely to help the company generate better rates, thereby giving a strong support to its bottom line.The re-build activities will provide meaningful benefit to United Rentals and the entire rental industry through 2018 as well, thereby boosting rental revenues, equipment utilization and rental rates.Equipment Rentals, comprising about 86% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equipment Rentals revenues of $1.5 billion reflect a growth of 10% sequentially and 13.8% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Rental Equipment revenues of $127 million indicates an increase of 13.4% from the prior quarter. Again, New Equipment revenues are expected to increase 18.7% on a year-over-year basis. Contractor Supplies revenues will likely witness 1.2% growth and that for Service and Other Revenues 7.8%.The company has been experiencing higher demand in its core construction and industrial sectors. Commercial construction has also remained strong. Upstream oil and gas is also gaining traction with improving macro conditions. United Rentals’ rental revenues were up 13.5% year over year in the last reported quarter. The company is likely to experience similar trends in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.72 billion, implying 13.7% growth. The solid improvement in the top line, driven by higher rates and volume, is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.99, reflecting a 16% year-over-year increase.United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Rentals, Inc.

Sherwin-Williams should gain from significant synergies of the Valspar acquisition. The company is also benefiting from its actions to cut operating costs. It also remains focused on growth through expansion of operations.However, the company faces earnings headwinds from charges related to Valspar acquisition.

580,URI,"We upgraded United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on Sep 20.Notably, shares of the company have rallied 27.8% in the last three months, compared with the 2.8% gain of the industry it belongs to. Additionally, United Rentals outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames. The company surpassed estimates in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 7%. Estimates have moved 0.7% north for the current quarter and year over the last 60 days, hinting at the stock’s solid prospects.Key Growth DriversAs the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals enjoys strong brand recognition, which enables it to draw customers and build customer loyalty. The company’s main strategy is to improve profitability of its core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies.In particular, the company’s strategy calls for the implementation of Project XL, which is a set of eight specific work streams focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability through cost savings. The company expects Project XL to contribute at least a $200 million run-rate benefit to EBITDA by 2018-end.United Rentals’ extensive and diverse fleet distinguishes it from the other players in the same space. The company’s rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry.  Also, expanding geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions has been a key growth strategy of United Rentals. In April 2017, United Rentals completed the acquisition of NES Rentals — one of the ten large general equipment rental companies in the United States. The acquisition expands United Rentals’ geographic footprint in key markets like East Coast, Gulf States and Midwest. It is also expected to strengthen relationships with local and strategic accounts in the construction and industrial sectors, thus enhancing cross-selling capabilities.The NES Rentals acquisition will benefit United Rentals’ technology and infrastructure. NES contributed $105 million to revenues and $46 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017. United Rentals has already realized $2.5 million in synergies and is on track to garner $40 million in cost savings from the NES transaction.The company also makes a good value pick with a Value Score of A, putting it in the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this perspective. This implies that the stock is trading lower than its fair value or intrinsic value and thus offers a significant upside potential.United Rentals’ focus on the implementation of Project XL, extensive and diverse fleet and strategic acquisitions ensure solid prospects.  In 2017, the company’s earnings are estimated to grow 13.5% compared to the projected rate of 6.1%. Sales growth is projected at 10.8%, higher than the industry’s estimated rate of 3%.We believe United Rentals is a potential outperformer with a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, making it a secure bet for the near term.Other Key PicksInvestors can also consider other top-ranked stocks in the Construction sector like Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), and M/I Homes, Inc. (MHO  -  Free Report).Beazer, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, surpassed earnings in two of the past four quarters, the average beat being 103.5%.

However, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Continued momentum across key markets for all three segments translated to strong orders and revenues in the quarter.

587,URI,"Hurricane Irma’s destructive power has already been felt throughout much of the Caribbean, and soon the tropical storm will hit Florida. With evacuations already underway throughout much of the state, and a great deal of damage projected, construction stocks and ETFs climbed on Friday.Irma UpdateNew forecasts don’t look good for Florida, as there is now only a microscopic chance that the hurricane doesn’t hit the state almost directly.“This is a catastrophic storm that this state has never seen,” Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a televised statement on Friday morning. “Based on what we now know, the majority of Florida will have major hurricane impacts, with deadly storm surge and life-threatening winds.”In preparation for #HurricaneIrma, I’m activating the Florida Disaster Fund to help support families & communities: https://t.co/dWpP4BeR68— Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) September 8, 2017The tropical storm has already killed at least 19 people in the Caribbean. And although Hurricane Irma has been downgraded to a Category 4 storm by the National Hurricane Center, its winds are still whipping at 155 mph.Hurricane warnings are in place throughout much of southern Florida, where more than 6 million people live, and current projections show Irma continuing through most of Florida up into the southeastern U.S. until Monday night.Tropical storm winds are likely to arrive in the FL Keys and south FL Saturday. Preparations should be rushed to completion. #Irma pic.twitter.com/eto2KVWtgP— NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) September 8, 2017“Severe hurricane conditions are expected over portions of the Florida peninsula and the Florida Keys beginning Saturday night. Irma is likely to make landfall in southern Florida as a dangerous major hurricane, and bring life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts to much of the state,” the NHC said in a statement on Friday morning.Construction Stocks As the Hurricane Harvey recovery process starts in the Houston area and some of southwestern Louisiana, Irma’s devastation is just about to begin. The two storms will—in all likelihood—lead to billions of dollars’ worth of damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure in both areas.Still, despite the seemingly distasteful nature, this perfect storm has caused construction stocks to pop on Friday.Shares of construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) gained 0.45% on Friday. Other companies in the industry also saw their stock prices rise before Irma makes landfall in Florida. Gibraltar Industries (ROCK  -  Free Report) stock jumped over 1.50%, while shares of United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report) and NCI Building Systems (NCS  -  Free Report) both climbed over 3.50%.In preparation for the newest storm, construction and infrastructure ETFs saw gains as well.

590,URI,"The Dow crossed the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year on Wednesday, rebounding from the lows it hit the last week due to rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington. These gains were broad based and incurred after the release of minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting last month. The minutes clearly indicated that Fed officials remain divided in their opinions to increase the interest rates. S&P 500 gained as the materials outperformed and Nasdaq ended in the green due to a rise in the shares of Apple. However, gains were pared after the Trump administration disbanded the Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum following a backlash from the top corporate leaders which grew stronger.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,024.87, advancing 0.1% or 25.88 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1%, or 3.5 points to close at 2,468.11. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,345.11, increasing 12.10 points or 0.2%. A total of around 5.8 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, below the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.52-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.23-to-1 ratio.Fed Minutes Indicate Divide over InflationThe Dow managed to finish above the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year, rebounding after a short lull. Such gains were possibly attributable to the release of July’s Fed policy meeting minutes. The minutes indicated that low inflation rates continue to worry a section of the central bank, The Fed’s favored gauge of inflation, core PCE inflation, came in at 1.5% for the month of June, well below the targeted level of 2%.  Consequently, Fed officials remain divided about the path of interest rate hikes. This came as welcome news for investors i, leading to gains for the Dow.However, the Central Bank is eager on unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The minutes also revealed that more than half the Fed officials wanted to wait till the next monetary meeting to release details about the planned unwinding of the humungous bond portfolio that the central bank has built up. This safely puts investors in a position to assume that the procedure might start in September, the time around which the Fed next meets.S&P 500, Nasdaq ReboundThe Nasdaq closed higher on Wednesday after shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) notched up a record high due to broadly encouraging economic conditions. Currently, the tech-laden index is trading above it 50-day moving average indicating a healthy performance for the tech sector.The S&P 500 closed higher as well and nine of its eleven primary sectors ended in the green, led by materials. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) gained almost 1%. Gains for the S&P 500 were mostly broad based. The index has surged 10% year to date and is notching record highs regularly. Tech shares have shown strong performances and just like the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 is also trading just above the 50-day moving average. This comes just after the stocks posted their second worst weekly performance for 2017. Markets have somewhat stabilized as the geopolitical tensions have subsided.Trump Disbands Advisory Panels, Markets pare GainsThe business community’s backlash against President Trump continued a reaction to his speech at the White Nationalist Rally in Virginia which turned violent. Such a sentiment led to several top CEOs stepping down from the Manufacturing Council.As a result, the President disbanded the Manufacturing Council as well as the Strategic and Policy Forum,. This decision is weighing on investors since it raises questions on Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-business growth agenda. The tax and regulatory reforms, a part of the President’s economic agenda now seems a farfetched dream. Moreover, the geopolitical tension due to frequent rhetoric against North Korea has only raised levels of uncertainty.Economic DataThe data for Housing Starts for the month of July fell 5.6% to 1,155,000 whereas the consensus estimated it to increase to 1,224,000. The data for building permits also showed a decline of 3.2% to 1,223,000 whereas the consensus estimated it to decrease to 1,263,000 from the previous month. Such events did not have an impact on the overall markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnion Pacific Aims Greater Efficiency With 750 LayoffsIn a bid to increase efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) announced in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it intends to trim its workforce.  (Read More)United Rentals to Acquire Neff Corp for $1.3 BillionUnited Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) , the largest equipment rental company in the world, has agreed to acquire Neff Corporation  or Neff, one of the 10 largest U.S. equipment rental companies.(Read More)One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

592,URI,"So far, we have seen Q2 results from only 15.4% of the construction companies in the S&P 500 cohort. Prominent construction companies like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) kick off the earnings season with both its top and bottom lines beating estimates.Investor sentiment seems to be quite high at the start of the second-quarter reporting cycle, given the solid earnings outlook and favorable construction sector’s fundamentals. Per the latest Earnings Trends, 100% companies posted earnings as well as revenue beat. Although total earnings of these construction companies have decreased by a meager 0.7% so far, its revenues have increased 15.5%.Overall, construction companies seem to be on solid ground. The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 15.8% in Q2 compared with 9% in the earlier quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 8.4% (6.8% growth in Q1).Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the sector’s performance in 2017. As such, demand for companies’ products should also increase, thereby driving revenues.Early next week, performance of other construction companies like Lennox International, Inc. (LII  -  Free Report) and RPM International Inc. (RPM  -  Free Report) will be closely watched to evaluate their position in investors’ portfolio.Let’s take a look at how these two construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly earnings releases on Jul 24.RPM International Inc. is slated to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and year-end results on Jul 24, 2017, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 27.27%. The company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 7.07%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.17.However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Our proven model suggests that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to confidently predict an earnings beat. However, this is not the case here, as RPM carries a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.17, reflecting a 3.5% year-over-year increase.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.88%. The company has a solid earnings surprise history, surpassing estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 8.81%.Lennox might beat earnings this season because it currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.45%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.80 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 per share for the second quarter reflects growth of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenue of $1.09 billion for the quarter, representing a 6.5% upside from the prior-year quarter (read more: Lennox Gears Up for Q2: Another Earnings Beat Coming?).Lennox International, Inc.

But these companies have been doing just that.Each has missed on earnings only once in the last 5 years.

Will we see improved numbers this quarter?2.    Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) has one of the best-looking charts on the Street yet it gets so little love from most investors.

596,URI,"We expect United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 19. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.16%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with the average beat being 9.13%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that United Rentals is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP: United Rentals has an Earnings ESP of +1.31%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.32, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.29. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Rentals currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of United Rentals’ favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?A number of favorable U.S. indicators of 2017 is adding to the positives. The company has been experiencing higher demand in its core construction and industrial sectors. Commercial construction has also remained strong. Upstream oil and gas is also gaining traction with improving macro conditions. The company is likely to experience similar trends in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, an opportunistic approach to acquisitions is an important part of United Rental’s growth strategy. In Apr 2017, United Rentals completed the acquisition of NES Rentals Holdings II, Inc. NES is one of the 10 large general equipment rental companies in the U.S., providing specialized aerial equipment to approximately 18,000 customers across the industrial and non-residential construction sectors. The latest addition will give a boost to its top line in the second quarter.However, United Rentals has been experiencing declining rental rates in the recent quarters, thereby creating pressure on margins. Notably, rental rates declined 1.4% in the first quarter of 2017 as well. Although this trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon, management expressed confidence during first-quarter earnings call that rental rates can improve in the second half of 2017 given the continued improvement in the utilization rate.This improvement is evident from the first-quarter time-utilization rate that came in at 66%, a record high for the January-March period. It improved 190 basis points year over year.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.29, reflecting a 11.2% year-over-year increase. The estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.54 billion, implying 8.7% growth.United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Rentals, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the construction sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.78% and a Zacks Rank #1.
