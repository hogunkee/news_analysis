20,FFIV,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

21,FFIV,"While software, semiconductor and internet stocks have enjoyed a productive 2018, cloud computing has had its share of success, too, making First Trust Cloud Computing (SKYY) a leading ETF.Cloud computing is a field that crosses into various industry groups. Companies in IBD's data storage, networking, online retail, enterprise software and other groups are part of the First Trust Cloud Computing portfolio. The ETF breaks down its holdings by software (nearly 39%), internet software and services (14.8%), communications equipment (14.2%) and a few other industries.Only some of the fund's holdings are pure-play cloud companies. First Trust says the holdings are divided among three classes. One is pure plays, another is companies that support cloud providers, and a third type is large companies with broad operations that indirectly use or support cloud computing. That last segment's weight in the portfolio is capped at 10%.With many of the technology giants among its 30 holdings, First Trust Cloud Computing is predominantly a large-cap ETF. The median market capitalization is $40.38 billion. It excludes stocks with less than $100 million in market cap.The largest component is Netflix (NFLX), with more than 7% of the portfolio. Netflix, which started as a DVD rent-by-mail service, is now predominantly a streaming video service. The stock is up more than 70% from a breakout to new highs at the start of the year.Amazon.com (AMZN), the No. 2 holding, may be best known for online retail, but it has a bustling cloud business. In its Q1 earnings report, Amazon said its cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, had revenue of $5.44 billion. That was up 49% and above estimates of about $5.3 billion.Other holdings are Akamai Technologies (AKAM), whose technology improves streaming content; network optimization expert F5 Networks (FFIV); Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in customer management software on demand; and Zynga (ZNGA), whose games are played on social networks and mobile devices.The ETF on May 7 cleared the 51.26 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and remains in buy range. The relative strength line is trending higher and near new highs, which can be read as a positive sign.Long term, the ETF has been a solid investment. Shares have climbed about 65% since they broke out to new highs nearly two years ago. That July 2016 breakout was important because the ETF beat resistance around 31 that had dogged shares for more than a year.Most of First Trust Cloud Computing's ascent in that time has been smooth, partly because the broad market saw little volatility in 2017. This year, the ETF has been more volatile, reflecting the general market. Shares have slid 12% and 11% in two corrections this year.RELATED:Active Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexAmazon Stock Jumps As Earnings Slaughter Views, Prime Fee RaisedSalesforce.com Price Target Hiked; MuleSoft To Spur Cloud Computing

"
104,FFIV,"Manny Rivelo, incoming chief executive of F5 Networks, has a tough act to follow, but he has brought a new way of thinking at the company. Under John McAdam, F5's CEO since 2000, the company grew to $1.7 billion in 2014 revenue, up from $100 million when he took the reins. McAdam is retiring June 30, but will stay on as board chairman.
"
105,FFIV,"Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) is the No. 1 seller of application delivery controllers, which direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.
"
106,FFIV,"Rivelo knows what it takes to grow scale in the IT industry, having worked at Cisco Systems (CSCO) for 19 years before joining F5 as vice president of security and strategic solutions in 2011. Cisco grew into a $44 billion company by the time Rivelo had departed. Its 20-year CEO, John Chambers, is retiring in July.
"
107,FFIV,"At Cisco, Rivelo's responsibilities spanned both engineering and sales.
"
108,FFIV,"Rivelo already has helped put in place strategies that aim to keep F5 a leader in information technology, as cloud computing drives big changes in corporate data centers. F5 is pushing into corporate security and subscription-based software, aiming to sell ADC-as-a-service.
"
109,FFIV,"""Manny has really driven strategy (amid) a very disruptive technology environment,"" McAdam told IBD. ""He brought a focus on software solutions, subscriptions and made us think about things we tended not to think about.""
"
110,FFIV,"F5's hardware business is still healthy, as customers upgrade to a new generation — ""big IP"" — of ADCs that handle higher data traffic. Building up F5's software business, though, is key.
"
111,FFIV,"For several years now F5 has sold software-based, or virtual, ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers.
"
112,FFIV,"In November, F5 unveiled a cloud strategy called ""Silverline,"" that at first will focus on security products. The Silverline service is similar in concept to infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, by which client companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet. Rivelo says F5's Silverline customer will be able to buy its software security products and eventually ADC software.
"
113,FFIV,"""If we're able to execute on our strategy, that subscription business will become material in a couple of years and we'll have a long tail of revenue coming from that,"" Rivelo said in an interview.
"
114,FFIV,"For shareholders, one question is whether Rivelo can keep F5's revenue growth in the double digits, or at least above the IT industry average. Many large companies are spending less on their own IT equipment, choosing instead to rent computing and data storage resources via the Internet.
"
115,FFIV,"F5's revenue growth has slowed to the midteens from blistering 30%-40% growth in 2010-11. F5 stock was a big winner in 2009 and 2010, but it touched its all-time high in January 2011 — above 145. Shares touched a three-year high above 136 in December and are now trading near 128.
"
116,FFIV,"With analysts expecting consolidation among IT hardware and software companies, another question is whether F5 will be a buyer, a seller or stay on the sidelines. Bernstein Research speculated this year that data storage system maker EMC (EMC) could target F5. And Cisco, which makes a ton of acquisitions, is also a potential buyer.
"
117,FFIV,"Rivelo says one of F5's strengths is its many partnerships across the IT industry. Partners include Cisco, VMware (VMW) and more recently in the public cloud, IaaS leader Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN). It's also teamed with Ericsson (ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).
"
118,FFIV,"Rivelo says F5 Networks may be better off staying independent, rather than being acquired by a bigger company. Besides the EMC speculation by Bernstein in March, F5 seems to surface as a rumored takeover target roughly every other year. The company's market valuation exceeds $9 billion.
"
119,FFIV,"""Part of our value is that we're sort of (technology) agnostic,"" he said. ""We think we're in a good position to help our customers and grow our business.
"
120,FFIV,"""If we were acquired, the (product) integration would be much more vertical, and our solution set could be more limited in the market because of the vertical integration an acquirer would want. Being independent is probably the right approach as we move forward.""
"

Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.

123,FFIV,"Many large companies are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.
"
124,FFIV,"Rivelo says F5 Networks is focused on the hybrid-cloud segment.
"
125,FFIV,"""Our strategy is to drive a hybrid set of solutions,"" he said. ""We see the modernization of the private data center as a combination, or a mix, of hardware and software, making applications more agile using a software-defined architecture.
"
126,FFIV,"""Our vision is that applications are being liberated to run in multiple locations. We're aiming to create the same consistency of service by making our software portable for those environments.""Manny Rivelo, incoming chief executive of F5 Networks, has a tough act to follow, but he has brought a new way of thinking at the company. Under John McAdam, F5's CEO since 2000, the company grew to $1.7 billion in 2014 revenue, up from $100 million when he took the reins. McAdam is retiring June 30, but will stay on as board chairman.Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) is the No. 1 seller of application delivery controllers, which direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.Rivelo knows what it takes to grow scale in the IT industry, having worked at Cisco Systems (CSCO) for 19 years before joining F5 as vice president of security and strategic solutions in 2011. Cisco grew into a $44 billion company by the time Rivelo had departed. Its 20-year CEO, John Chambers, is retiring in July.At Cisco, Rivelo's responsibilities spanned both engineering and sales.Rivelo already has helped put in place strategies that aim to keep F5 a leader in information technology, as cloud computing drives big changes in corporate data centers. F5 is pushing into corporate security and subscription-based software, aiming to sell ADC-as-a-service.""Manny has really driven strategy (amid) a very disruptive technology environment,"" McAdam told IBD. ""He brought a focus on software solutions, subscriptions and made us think about things we tended not to think about.""F5's hardware business is still healthy, as customers upgrade to a new generation — ""big IP"" — of ADCs that handle higher data traffic. Building up F5's software business, though, is key.For several years now F5 has sold software-based, or virtual, ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers.In November, F5 unveiled a cloud strategy called ""Silverline,"" that at first will focus on security products. The Silverline service is similar in concept to infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, by which client companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet. Rivelo says F5's Silverline customer will be able to buy its software security products and eventually ADC software.""If we're able to execute on our strategy, that subscription business will become material in a couple of years and we'll have a long tail of revenue coming from that,"" Rivelo said in an interview.For shareholders, one question is whether Rivelo can keep F5's revenue growth in the double digits, or at least above the IT industry average. Many large companies are spending less on their own IT equipment, choosing instead to rent computing and data storage resources via the Internet.F5's revenue growth has slowed to the midteens from blistering 30%-40% growth in 2010-11. F5 stock was a big winner in 2009 and 2010, but it touched its all-time high in January 2011 — above 145. Shares touched a three-year high above 136 in December and are now trading near 128.With analysts expecting consolidation among IT hardware and software companies, another question is whether F5 will be a buyer, a seller or stay on the sidelines. Bernstein Research speculated this year that data storage system maker EMC (EMC) could target F5. And Cisco, which makes a ton of acquisitions, is also a potential buyer.Rivelo says one of F5's strengths is its many partnerships across the IT industry. Partners include Cisco, VMware (VMW) and more recently in the public cloud, IaaS leader Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN). It's also teamed with Ericsson (ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).Rivelo says F5 Networks may be better off staying independent, rather than being acquired by a bigger company. Besides the EMC speculation by Bernstein in March, F5 seems to surface as a rumored takeover target roughly every other year. The company's market valuation exceeds $9 billion.""Part of our value is that we're sort of (technology) agnostic,"" he said. ""We think we're in a good position to help our customers and grow our business.""If we were acquired, the (product) integration would be much more vertical, and our solution set could be more limited in the market because of the vertical integration an acquirer would want. Being independent is probably the right approach as we move forward.""F5 Networks competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN).

186,FFIV,"Akamai Technologies, a provider of content delivery network and cloud infrastructure services, is riding a wave of open-ended technology trends to steady growth.As companies and their customers do more business online and via the cloud, demand for faster online user experiences and greater levels of security is mounting, and each of those developments fits directly into Akamai's (AKAM) wheelhouse.The company's system of servers and other equipment that accelerates online content delivery and bolsters security against cyberattacks is in increasing demand, Chief Financial Officer James Benson says, and it has boosted revenue throughout 2014 and positioned the firm for the year ahead.""The secular tailwinds are going to remain,"" Benson told IBD.Akamai posted a third-quarter profit of $91.2 million, up from $79.8 million a year earlier, on $498 million in revenue. Its top line was up 26%. Adjusted earnings per share — excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other special items — climbed 24% year over year to 62 cents.'Right Direction'Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, forecast EPS of 64 cents for the fourth quarter on sales of nearly $529 million. For all of 2014, they anticipate sales of nearly $1.96 billion, 24% ahead of 2013. Analysts forecast full-year EPS of $2.42, a 20% jump.""I absolutely see the trends continuing to be strong (and) going in the right direction"" for Akamai, B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha said.Akamai is the No. 2 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 50 out of 197 groups. The next largest players are three highly rated firms: F5 Networks (FFIV), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI).Akamai's Media Delivery Solutions category posted a revenue increase of 22% for the third quarter. More double-digit growth lies ahead as people increasingly weave online activities into their daily routines, Benson says.Akamai's global network of servers stores copies of online content in order to expedite delivery to its clients' customers. Those end users experience relatively few video streaming interruptions and faster downloads because Akamai's services effectively route them around Internet congestion, Benson says. Akamai also provides a range of software updates such as the routine upgrades issued for products like Apple's (AAPL) iPads.""We believe it will continue,"" Benson said, referring to the robust demand for Akamai's media services. The business, he added, ""has been a nice growth accelerant for the company.""At the same time, as corporate clients of myriad stripes — from online retailers to banking companies — capitalize on cloud-based service and handle more customer transactions online, they want higher levels of security to guard against hackers and data breaches.Headlines about breaches at banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and retailers like Home Depot (HD) have called attention to the need for cybersecurity and lifted demand for Akamai's services, Benson says.What Akamai provides in this regard are firewalls for Web applications and added layers of protection around clients' data centers. The company, he says, detects breaches at the edge of its network, ""far from customers' data centers. ... (and) we thwart the attacks.""Akamai's Performance and Security Solutions segment generated 29% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter.Benson says that Akamai does about 70% of its business in the U.S., but he added that its international operations, in Asia and Europe, are growing at a faster rate. He cites strong demand for its services in Japan, Korea and Singapore.Sinha says that Akamai should benefit from solid demand as its clients recognize that they must defend against security threats and as end users demand high-level online video, gaming and social media.""They have major tailwinds at their back,"" Sinha said.Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says that gaming and social media should continue to boost Akamai. ""Clearly, we're seeing acceleration in media delivery,"" he said. ""That's really where they have outperformed this year.""He expects growth on those fronts to build into long-term trends. ""That's the bull case for this story,"" Synesael said.Tough FieldAll of that noted, Akamai's story is not free of headwinds.The company has formidable competition that includes Limelight Networks (LLNW), Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Verizon Communications (VZ).It could also lose some ground with one of its most prominent clients, Apple, Synesael says. Apple, which accounts for 6% of Akamai's revenue by Synesael's estimation, is building its own internal content delivery network.""The concern is, are they going to shift more in-house in 2015?"" Synesael said of Apple, adding that other Akamai clients could make similar moves.After reporting third-quarter results, Akamai executives conceded to analysts that because the firm's media business is based on traffic volumes, its growth from one quarter to the next could be bumpy, given that gaming and software releases, as well as the adoption of new social media and video platform upgrades, tend to vary.But over the course of several coming quarters, Benson expects that favorable tech trends will continue to advance in Akamai's favor.""We are not opportunity constrained,"" he said.

Facebook (FB) also received an overweight rating, with a price target of 154.The gain by Alphabet — and the weak opening action of Verizon (VZ), down 0.3% — ran counter to expectations following approval by the U.S. House of Representatives late Tuesday to end privacy provisions enacted by the Federal Trade Commission. Those provisions require internet service providers to obtain permission from consumers in order to share and employ certain specific internet use data. The rule was seen as a benefit to companies such as Google/Alphabet and Facebook, which remained free to use such data.The reversal of the rule, approved in the Senate a week ago, gives companies like Verizon and Comcast (CMCSA) freedom to use or to sell to third parties specific customer internet use data, providing a new profit and marketing source.

266,FFIV,"Apple (AAPL) approached a buy point and most of the FANG stocks rose modestly Wednesday, now six weekdays since the surprise presidential election of Donald Trump — who has had some pointed criticism for the tech industry — sent big tech stocks tumbling before modestly rebounding the past two days.In fact, Apple and the other large FANG internets — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — had started falling at least two weeks before Election Day (except for Google-owner Alphabet, whose downturn began Oct. 28). All four FANGs had been trading at or near all-time highs, but mixed earnings for Apple, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the group.But after the election, a sector rotation ensued, with industries such as drugs and banks getting a lift from Trump's win, and techs, alternative-energy and other arenas getting hit.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest tech companies, of course, aren't necessarily the best tech stocks for investors at any given time. Which techs are best? There are tons of opinions and answers when asking that question, but a good source to put on your checklist is IBD's Tech Leaders.But Trump's election-campaign views and expected priorities have good as well as bad connotations for tech industries.William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri summed it up in a research note Wednesday:""Overall, we believe his views on global trade, net neutrality and internet privacy, and immigration could have negative consequences for technology companies, but his tax plan (including reducing the repatriation tax rate to 10%) would be a net positive given the large amount of foreign cash that many technology companies possess.""Trump's repatriation tax plan could bring big bucks back to the U.S. for the top five companies with overseas holdings. Besides Apple and Alphabet, the top five include Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).In his note, Suri was not shy about pointing out what Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle might target with that cash. Microsoft, he said, might go after ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO) or Symantec (SYMC). Cisco he sees eyeing FireEye (FEYE), Gigamon (GIMO) and F5 Networks (FFIV). Oracle, he says, might take a run at Veeva Systems (VEEV) or Tableau Software (DATA).In the meantime, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix rose for a second straight day. Facebook was the only decliner, falling 0.73% to 116.34, after touching a more than four-month low of 113.55 on Monday.Apple was the big gainer of the bunch on Wednesday, rising 2.7% to 110.04. That was easily its best day since Trump's win, marking its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 14. It is nearing a 118.79 buy point out of a flat base.Netflix stock rose a fraction to 115.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 129.40.Shares of Alphabet and Amazon rose 0.62% and 0.39%, respectively.RELATED:Apple, FANGs Stop The Bleeding Post-Trump

Baird kept its 338 price target, noting that Model 3 production is on schedule.Tesla shares rose to 213.70 in the morning, but found resistance the 50-day line. By the close shares edged up just 0.6% to 203.50 on the stock market today.Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh trimmed his price target on the media giant to 125 from 128, while keeping an outperform rating. The lower price target reflects a 2%-4% reduction in his earnings estimates for 2017-2018.Sheikh cited the proposed AT&T (T) merger with Time Warner (TWX), which could create strategic challenges for ESPN and raise the cost of bidding for sports broadcasting rights. He also cited lower ratings for NFL games, but doesn't expect the weak start to the year to remain the trend.Disney could grow by buying Twitter (TWTR) or Netflix (NFLX), Sheikh said, but growing organically would be more costly.Disney shares rose 0.6% to 94.02.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard upgraded the virtualization software leader to buy from neutral, raising his price target to 95 from 79 after VMware topped earnings estimates late Wednesday.

294,FFIV,"Imperva (IMPV) stock rocketed to a seven-week high Tuesday after billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Associates revealed a nearly 10% stake in the cloud security firm, but Needham kept a hold rating on shares, questioning how much Imperva can pick up the pace later this year.At the close on the stock market today, Imperva stock finished up 12.4% to 45.46, leading IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, which was up 1%. CyberArk Software (CYBR) climbed 3% to 49.77 and Symantec (SYMC) lifted 2.2% to 20.92.Elliott acquired 9.8% in Imperva stock late Monday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, Elliott argues Imperva stock is ""materially undervalued.""Imperva ""operates in a highly strategic area of the technology industry with an attractive competitive position and a compelling product set in both the web-application firewall (WAF) and database activity monitoring markets,"" Elliott wrote.But Needham analyst Scott Zeller kept a hold rating Tuesday on Imperva stock. Zeller had downgraded shares in May after Imperva's June-quarter sales guidance for $65.5 million to $66.5 million missed views for $70.2 million, although sales would rise a solid 23% vs. last year at the midpoint of Imperva's forecast.For the year, Imperva guided to $304 million to $307 million in sales, up 30%. That would require a major second-half ramp. The consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models 10.5%, 23% and 20% quarter-over-quarter growth for the next three periods, respectively, to edge the midpoint of Imperva's guidance.""We continue to have reservations about the 'back-end loaded' year-end estimates,"" Zeller wrote in a research report. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales stalled in Q1, prompting Imperva to remove its EMEA head of sales, further risking Q2 and full-year sales.Elliott's guidance could be a boon, Zeller acknowledged. Elliott has been involved with Blue Coat, Riverbed, BMC Software, Qlik Technologies (QLIK), Novell and Compuware.And Imperva is in a sweet spot for cybersecurity spending, which has trudged below 2014-2015 levels.""The hysterical buying patterns in security software over the 2014-2015 time frame are showing signs of cooling, and growth rates are showing signs of deceleration,"" Zeller wrote. But he said that ""Imperva remains an attractive asset because of its scarcity value and position in security spending pockets which still get funding.""WAF (web application firewall) and database sales comprise about 40% and 45%, respectively, of Imperva's total revenue, leaving a 5% chunk for fast-growing cloud security. No. 2 cybersecurity firm Symantec last week announced an agreement to acquire cloud-security player Blue Coat for $4.65 billion. That deal is expected to close in Q3.Imperva's rivals are few and far between, Zeller notes. It competes minimally with F5 Networks (FFIV) in WAF and faces off with IBM (IBM) Guardium in database security.

(F5 Networks shot up nearly 13% on Tuesday on a report that it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to help review takeover approaches.)“From a strategic perspective, we believe HPE could be a possible suitor,” said Kisner in a report. “HPE’s Aruba acquisition has been doing well. At Discover, (CEO Meg) Whitman noted that the size of potential acquisitions is less of an issue than their valuation. We note that F5 is trading at a similar valuation as Aruba pre-acquisition.”Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz has an underweight rating on Hewlett Packard Enterprise.""The Discover customer conference highlighted management confidence in GDP-like revenue growth as the company invests outside the data center in the $25B campus/edge market and machine learning,"" wrote Moskowitz in a report. ""HPE exhibited some flexibility on M&A, as there was commentary suggesting acquisitions can be pursued if done at the right multiples. Given the successes of Aruba, 3PAR, and ArcSight, we think HPE’s M&A track record has enough support to pursue a larger acquisition if it can move the revenue needle.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp.

West Texas Intermediate futures for July delivery settled up 79 cents to $50.48 a barrel. That's the first close above $50 for U.S. crude in 11 months. Declining production, along with fires in Canada and terrorism in Nigeria, have combined to double the price of crude since February.Among IBD 50 stocks, 37 were higher and 13 were lower. The best performer was Thor Industries (THO), which reported better-than-expected earnings but missed slightly on revenue. It gapped up on big volume for a nearly 6% gain.How Does Thor Industries earnings and revenue growth measure up with other leading stocks?The Dow was helped by advances for its two energy components, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). They rose 2% apiece on the strength of oil prices.But Verizon (VZ) was also a big contributor to the Dow's outperformance, popping by more than 2%. Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said at an industry conference that an acquisition of Yahoo (YHOO) would fit nicely into the company's strategy. It also expects a per-share hit to Q2 earnings of 5 to 7 cents because Verizon's recent labor strike required it to pay managers overtime and hire lots of contractors, while new installations lagged.

319,FFIV,"F5 Networks (FFIV) could be a buyer, not a seller, and might use its sizable cash-on-hand to acquire a data center security  provider, says Pacific Crest Securities.Some analysts have speculated F5 Networks itself could be sold, amid its slowing revenue growth. F5 Network stock has clawed back 7% in 2016 after falling 25% in 2015. But F5 Networks stock was down 1.5%, near 106, in early trading in the stock market today.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest,  downgraded F5 Networks stock on Tuesday to sector weight.“Going forward, we see an increasing probability that M&A will have a greater role in defining (F5 Network’s) ‘third act,’ particularly given that F5 has excess cash reserves of $1 billion and robust operating cash flows that exceed $600 million annually,"" he wrote in a research report.Seattle-based F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) -- electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.F5 Networks has made some small security-related acquisitions, including Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services that help protect websites from large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as well as Israel-based Versafe, a maker of software that protects Web applications from malware, fraud and phishing attacks.F5 Network’s closest rival in application-based data center security is Imperva (IMPV), analysts say.The so-called perimeter firewall market -- the main type of firewall -- is a crowded field, with Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) among the vendors.Another concern is that F5’s revenue growth might not rebound in 2016, Bracelin said.“The Shasta appliance refresh cycle will not drive a return to double-digit product growth, at least not for any quarter this year, and that there is increasing execution risk with a higher probability of M&A within cloud security,” he added.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), as well as Radware (RDWR) and A10 Networks (ATEN).

Analysts had estimated $1.63 and $486.2 million.“F5 Networks reported mixed March-quarter results with revenue falling below expectations, but lower taxes and an aggressive share repurchase helped EPS come in better than consensus,” said Troy Jensen, analyst at Piper Jaffray, in a research report.F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs)-- electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. Top rivals include Cisco Systems (CSCO) (IBD).The company forecasts current-quarter revenue of $495 million at its midpoint, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter and below. consensus estimates of $503 million. It expects EPS in a range of $1.77 to $1.80, up from $1.67 and above analyst consensus of $1.74 per share.“Management guided revenue below the Street, citing ongoing uncertainty in the macro and IT spending environment and potential pauses ahead of the new product cycle,” said Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair, in a research report.“Looking beyond the current quarter, even with a product refresh cycle on the horizon, we believe F5 will struggle to grow its product sales on a sustainable basis due to multiple headwinds from a maturing on-premise ADC market, competitive pressure from the public cloud, and a stand-alone security portfolio that has so far been unable to compete effectively in an already crowded security market,” Ader wrote.F5 Networks stock was up 2.5% in premarket trading Thursday, near 96 and just about even for 2016.

""It is somewhat disappointing to see the weakness in EMEA telecoms (which was the case in fiscal Q4 as well), especially considering that in Q4, JNPR's service provider segment grew by a strong 25% year over year and that JNPR had an easy compare in the Q1 service provider segment (where revenue declined 8% year over year the year before).""Seyrafi noted that AT&T (T) expects to grow capital expenditures 6% to $22 billion this year, while Verizon (VZ) implied a 3% decline in capex to a range of $17.2 billion to $17.8 billion. ""So U.S.-based service providers will likely not be driving much growth for communication equipment suppliers this year,"" he said.""We do think that Juniper felt what Cisco (outperform-rated) noted in February, namely that some customers paused to digest what was happening following financial market turbulence at the beginning of the year,"" Seyrafi wrote. ""However, we do note that financial markets rebounded in March, and JNPR CEO Rami Rahim stated that the company remains constructive on fiscal 2016 as the company expects new products to add to growth while the company maintains ongoing focus on cost discipline.""Juniper said that it expects to report earnings per share minus items of 35 cents to 37 cents, down from its prior guidance of 42-46 cents. Wall Street had expected 43-44 cents, up 34% to 38% from Q1 2015. Juniper's new midpoint, 36 cents, would be up 12%.Juniper expects Q1 revenue of $1.09 billion to $1.10 billion, down from its prior guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.19 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.16 billion, up 8.4%.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Juniper is set to release full Q1 results after the close April 28.William Blair analyst Jason Ader maintained his outperform rating on Juniper stock but ""modestly lowered"" full-year estimates for 2016 and 2017.Analyst Alex Henderson at Needham reiterated his hold rating and said that he's ""firmly on the sidelines,"" as he too trimmed estimates. Neither Ader nor Henderson have price targets for Juniper stock.""While we see Juniper as one of the weaker companies in our coverage, there could be read-throughs to other names such as Cisco, F5 Networks (FFIV) and Viavi (VIAV),"" Henderson said in a Tuesday research note. ""We think Arista and Gigamon (GIMO) are likely to be able to power through the choppy environment. Given the magnitude of the (Juniper) top-line miss, we think estimates for Q2 will have to be ratcheted back as well.""F5 stock tumbled 2.2% Tuesday, while Gigamon fell 2.1% and Viavi Solutions fell 1.8%.

393,FFIV,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

394,FFIV,"The stock of Juniper Networks (JNPR), recently admired for being a sparkle in the eyes of Ericsson (ERIC), dived as much as 17% Thursday to a nine-month low, after management lowered its guidance for the first quarter and the company announced that its CFO had resigned.The stock's fall made Sanford Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu look prescient for downgrading Juniper stock Jan. 5, with the most upbeat downgrade that Juniper might ever see. While repeatedly praising Juniper for good performance, Ferragu warned that with an acquisition by Ericsson ""largely off the table ... the downside, a weak quarter, would probably take the stock back 15%-20%, as this is the minimum impact on earnings (that) weaker revenues would trigger.”Juniper stock is down 31% from its 32.39 high set Nov. 4, the day before Juniper's biggest rival, Cisco Systems (CSCO), entered into a ""strategic partnership"" with Ericsson. The announcement knocked Juniper out of Ericsson's sights as an acquisition target, although Ericsson said that it would continue to use some Juniper products.Juniper closed down 15.4% to 22.46 in the stock market today. Cisco stock closed down 1.4%.The weak Q1 2016 guidance that Juniper offered after Wednesday's market close was tied at least in part to foreign-exchange currency issues: ""Conservatism in the face of increased macro/FX concerns was the main reason for this adjustment,"" Jefferies analyst George Notter wrote in a research note Thursday.Juniper guided Q1 revenue to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.19 billion, up 6% from 2015's Q1. It guided Q1 EPS to a range of 42 to 46 cents minus items, vs. the 47 cents that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimated and that would represent a 47% jump from Q1 2015.""A bit confounding,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research note regarding Juniper's softer guidance. He added that F5 Networks (FFIV) ""cited top-down macro concerns in lowering guidance; Apple (AAPL) may also have overplayed macro in results.""Nomura rates Juniper stock a neutral with a 30 price target. Jefferies rates it as a hold but lowered its price target Thursday to 27.50 from 33.For Q4, Juniper earnings rose 54% from 2014's Q4 to 63 cents per share minus items, beating analysts by 3 cents, on revenue up 20% to $1.32 billion vs. Wall Street's $1.30 billion consensus. The recent Q4 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2014 when Q4 produced the only shrinking quarter for earnings in two years, down 5% from 2013.For 2015, Juniper's revenue rose 5% to $4.86 billion, or 7% adjusted for the sale of its Junos Pulse software in 2014. Earnings rose 40% to $2.03 per share minus items.""I'm pleased with how well we've diversified our customer base across multiple verticals and geographies, and improved our operations,"" Juniper CFO Robyn Denholm said in the company's earnings release. ""Our focus continues to be on our fundamentals: improving execution, continuing cost discipline and operational efficiency.""The company disclosed that Denholm had resigned effective with the 2015 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission but would stick around for ""several months."" Ken Miller, currently senior vice president of finance, will succeed her as CFO.""As a challenger in this industry, we plan to remain nimble, anticipate and deliver what our customers require for network innovation, and continue our relentless focus on execution to maximize long-term value for our shareholders,"" Juniper CEO Rami Rahim said in a statement.Top rival Cisco is by far the biggest player in IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, with a market value topping $117 billion vs. No. 2 Juniper's $8.6 billion. But Juniper has an IBD Composite Rating of 83, vs. Cisco's 63.

Shares in the data center gear maker are down 23% in 2015.Unlike RBC Capital, which last week speculated that F5 Network's cash hoard and lower valuation could attract a buyer, perhaps from private equity, Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal makes no mention of possible M&A.""The company now has $16 per share in cash on its balance sheet. This is despite F5's propensity for aggressive share repurchases,"" wrote Kvaal, who lowered his price target to 90. ""The company has used almost all of its free cash flow to repurchase shares. Since their peak in fiscal 2007, F5's shares outstanding have fallen from 85 million to 71 million.""He says F5 Networks should add debt to repurchase even more shares and boost EPS growth.""We believe F5 has an opportunity to make more efficient use of its balance sheet by issuing debt, buying back significantly more stock and initiating a dividend. Management has resisted such actions, given that it considers itself a growth company. The company stated it would consider a recapitalization event should its product refresh fail to reignite growth. We think the earliest opportunity to reach such a conclusion would be in late 2017.""F5 Networks is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) — electronic boxes and software that direct data traffic to computer servers.

He says that F5 generates free cash flow — net cash from operations minus capital expenses — in excess of $500 million a year.""External investors are starting to sniff around F5's low (price-earnings) multiple and strong cash generation,"" Sue wrote.

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 dipped 0.1% each. The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%.Volume increased 15% on the Nasdaq, 5% on the NYSE, relative to Wednesday morning's trade.A weaker-than-expected Q3 GDP estimate knocked the stock market today off its positive premarket stance, and as-expected unemployment claims did little to counter the effect.Pending home sales also pressed the down button, slipping 2.3% in September, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was a sharp step down from August's 1.4% decline and more than double the 1% decline expected by consensus.Two-thirds of the Dow moved lower, with Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE) staking out the low ground with losses of nearly 2%.Pfizer reversed its premarket gains that followed news reports that it was in early stage discussions regarding a possible merger with Allergan (AGN). Allergan confirmed the reports early Thursday. Its shares flattened from an 11% premarket gain to a fractional advance after the open.On the S&P 500, Hanesbrands (HBI) stretched out a 7% gain after a strong Q3 report late Wednesday. F5 Networks (FFIV) dropped 7% on its Q3 report, also delivered after Wednesday's close.Chipmakers faced broad selling pressure in early action, feeling some drawdown from NXP Semiconductors' (NXPI) 17% dive. NXP reported weaker-than-consensus revenue, citing slowing customer orders and rising industry inventories.The Philadelphia semiconductor index is up less than 1% this week after rallying 14% over the prior four weeks.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Cavium (CAVM), both fabless chipmakers on the IBD 50 list, dropped 4% after reporting earnings late Wednesday. Cirrus scored a clear Q3 revenue and earnings win. Cavium's results just met expectations.Avago Technologies (AVGO) shed 3%.

It is in the seventh week of a cup-with-handle base formed within a longer consolidation.On the high side of the IBD 50, Ellie Mae (ELLI) climbed 5% after topping third-quarter consensus revenue and earnings expectations. The number of users of the mortgage lease provider's online Encompass service rose 47% year over year, with a 24% increase in per user revenue. Management's Q4 earnings guidance was below consensus forecasts. The stock is back above its 50-day moving average and working on its fourth straight advance as it builds the right side of a two-month base.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) popped 5% after reporting strong Q3 results late Wednesday. The auto parts chain also beat on its revenue and earnings line, while guiding Q4 EPS below consensus estimates.

625,FFIV,"F5 Networks (FFIV), a maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), has continued its winning ways under new CEO Manuel Rivelo, boosting revenue and profit by capitalizing on high demand for new software and security services to guard against digital data breaches. The Seattle-based company, whose client base ranges from the U.S. government to Facebook (FB), is the No. 1 seller of ADCs. The electronic devices direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, helping to make websites and communication networks faster and more efficient.F5 has in recent years expanded its ties with customers by also selling them security products and services, and continues to do so under Rivelo. Demand in this arena is mounting amid a torrent of headlines about major organizations suffering cyberattacks that resulted in costly data breaches. In recent months alone, cybercriminals have infiltrated systems at Harvard University, health insurer Anthem (WLP), and the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which also includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Equinix (EQIX).""It's just going to keep growing and growing,"" U.S. Global Investors trader Mike Matousek told IBD, referring to demand for data security. He said investors are increasingly interested in companies such as F5 because they are continuously hearing that organizations fear the worst when it comes to cybersecurity and view as vital their ongoing investments in the latest technology to thwart breaches.Investors See Opportunity""So there's more opportunity here,"" Matousek said. ""There's a lot of potential ahead.""F5's stock is up about 14% over the past year. The company in July posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $483.6 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and GAAP net income of $93.2 million, up 8.7%. On a per-share non-GAAP basis, earnings rose 5% to $1.67.The sales trajectory is expected to continue. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, F5 set a revenue goal of $500 million to $510 million.A company executive told IBD that F5 does not break out the percentage of its product revenue generated by its security business. But during the company's earnings call in July, F5 executives said software sales, which are often linked with security services, have more than doubled over the past three years and now make up about a third of revenue. Customers, the company said, are moving more of their systems into the cloud, via software, and need accompanying security protections.Rivelo, a former Cisco Systems executive, officially took the helm at F5 on July 1. But he began leading the company after his promotion, from executive vice president of strategic solutions to CEO, was announced last spring. He replaced John McAdam, who had been F5 Networks' chief executive for about 15 years.Rivelo was not available to comment for this article, but during the earnings call he said F5's security business will remain ""a major growth driver"" for the company.Given the spate of highly publicized cyberattacks, he added, ""more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers, and public and private clouds.""Rivelo said in F5's third quarter alone it established major new business relationships on the security front with a branch of the U.S. government and ""a prestigious medical research group,"" among others.New Global Sales ChiefCFO Andy Reinland told investors recently that security ""continues to be key for us. And we're going to continue to incentivize the sales force to really push that."" This week F5 named John DiLullo to lead global sales, reporting to Rivelo.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management and an observer of companies affected by cyberattacks including banks, said in an interview that ""it is hard to see where the threat ends.""He said regulators of various industries and leaders of major governments around the world are increasingly paying attention to cybersecurity and likely will over time join forces to create stronger global security standards. This, he said, should make it easier for companies and governments to work together to combat cybercriminals.Should all of that materialize in coming years, Paulsen said, it could help more companies get beyond playing catch-up on the security front and instead make investments to continuously stay ahead of criminals. This, he said, could ultimately minimize the number of high-profile breaches. But it would not diminish the need for high-level security services.Looking For Acquisitions""It's never going to go away,"" he said of the threat of attacks. ""They aren't going to just shut this down, but the good guys are going to get better and better at this.""Toward that end, F5 said it is on the lookout for acquisitions that can fortify its suite of products and help drive more growth.""We look for a nice technology tuck-in that we can bring in, integrate the code into the platform, and then offer it as part of a platform solution,"" Rivelo said at an August conference. ""We do aggressively look at companies ... We look at them every week.""He said sellers' pricing expectations are currently a bit lofty. ""In general, right now it's a little heated,"" Rivelo said of the M&A market. But if F5 finds an appealing and affordable target, ""we'll bring it on board to accelerate our roadmap and our vision.""

645,FFIV,"Cisco Systems, about to end an era when its longtime CEO John Chambers steps down, continues to show some resilience. The No. 1 maker of computer networking equipment late Wednesday reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that edged analyst estimates, and gave guidance for the current quarter that was basically in line with views.Cisco's (CSCO) prior earnings report in February also beat views.Cisco stock fell a fraction in after-hours trading. Shares rose 0.4% in Wednesday's regular session to 29.35.The San Jose, Calif.-based company is undergoing a transition that involves focusing more on emerging growth areas, including products and services for data centers, wireless networks and security, to offset slowing growth for its core network routers and switches.The company's newer product areas also include Software Defined Networking, where software takes the lead role in managing company information networks. And a year ago, Cisco said it would invest $1 billion over the next two years in building up its cloud services for customers.On May 4, Cisco said 18-year company veteran Chuck Robbins, senior vice president of worldwide operations, will replace Chambers as chief executive starting July 26. Chambers, who has led the company since 1995, will become executive chairman.Equipment makers such as Juniper Networks (JNPR) and F5 Networks (FFIV) also have posted better-than-expected quarters this year. The vendors have been sparked by resurging demand from companies outside of the telecom industry, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""The enterprise market has done reasonably well,"" White told IBD. ""It's the carrier market in the U.S. that has been difficult.""Host Of New ProductsCisco has helped its cause with new products in areas including routing, switching, data centers and security, White says.""A lot of new products have come out within the last 12 to 18 months that are starting to drive more revenue,"" he said. ""They have been executing very well.""For the quarter ended April 25, Cisco reported earnings per share minus items of 54 cents, up 5.9% from the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 5.1% to $12.1 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled 53 cents and $12.06 billion.For the current quarter, Cisco predicted adjusted EPS of 55-57 cents on revenue of $12.48 billion to $12.73 billion.Analysts had forecast 56 cents EPS on sales of $12.59 billion.Cautious guidance was expected, White says.""You are going to hear a little more conservatism with your guidance because you don't want to have (Robbins) come in and have the company miss,"" he said.In the conference call with analysts, Chambers said Cisco continues to perform well in a tough global market, including emerging markets such as China and Russia, and a tough foreign exchange environment.""Across every market and every industry we are moving from the information age to the digital age and the pace of change is only accelerating,"" he said. ""Our vision and strategy are working as every company, city and country becomes digital. They are realizing that Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations.""For Q3, product revenue rose 5.7% to $9.32 billion and services revenue rose 3.1% to $2.81 billion.Router sales rose 3.8% to $2 billion and switching equipment sales rose 5.7% to $3.56 billion.

684,FFIV,"How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market
"
685,FFIV,"There are bull markets and bear markets. But in the world of stocks, the cruelest beast of all is a choppy market. In a bull or bear market, there is a well-defined trend. The attentive investor can avoid the worst of the bear by quickly standing aside, watching from the sidelines as the market falls.
"
686,FFIV,"But a choppy market offers no trend. It first feigns a seductive rally, then just when it appears money is to be made, pulls back. Stocks break out, then sputter, falling back near the proper buy point or below it. The overly aggressive investor dies a death by a thousand cuts as trade after trade frustratingly ends with a small loss.
"
687,FFIV,"Once you recognize you're in such a market, it's often best to keep your investments small. Don't get fully invested. Take profits quickly. Cut losses even more quickly.
"
688,FFIV,"One tool that can help the investor in this circumstance is a stock's relative strength line. It should be holding up and moving higher. That tells you your stock is outperforming the broad market.
"
689,FFIV,"IBD's RS line is a simple but powerful concept. The closing price of a stock each day is divided by the S&P 500. That fraction is plotted on both the daily and weekly chart.
"
690,FFIV,"It's the trend that counts. If the RS line is rising, that means your stock is outperforming the S&P 500 — even if your stock was down for the day. If the line is falling, your stock is underperforming.

691,FFIV,"After the market has been in decline for a time, a new batch of leading stocks should emerge. Those are the ones to focus on.
"
692,FFIV,"Potential market leaders will firm up and begin rising even while the market is still in decline. This is because the smart money realizes the company has great fundamentals and potential for further growth. The top fund managers use the correction in the general market as an opportunity to accumulate shares.
"
693,FFIV,"Typically, in the early stages of a new bull market — just when you want to be buying — the RS line will often go to a new high before the stock does and sometimes shoot up almost vertically.
"
694,FFIV,"IBD readers get an added bonus from the relative strength concept: the Relative Price Strength Rating.
"
695,FFIV,"Using a proprietary formula, each stock is ranked by its relative performance over the past year, with extra emphasis given to the past three months.

696,FFIV,"Then, each stock is ranked on a 1 to 99 scale. A stock with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 90 or higher is in the top 10% of stocks in overall market performance. In general, investors should limit themselves to stocks with 80 Relative Strength Ratings or above.
"
697,FFIV,"Look at F5 Networks (FFIV) in 2009. Even as the market was in free fall in the early part of the year, F5's RS line was holding its own. Then, starting in March, the RS line went nearly vertical (1) as the stock climbed sharply for five straight weeks.

Sweden-based Pingdom makes software that monitors website performance.""While we anticipate some growth this year to come from SolarWinds' June 2014, acquisition of Pingdom, specifically on the subscription revenue front, we believe growth will also come through efforts to accelerate international business and with a focus on key markets as SolarWinds appears poised to benefit from solid new license sales growth with an expanded addressable market and strong cross-selling potential with its broader product portfolio,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives in a research report Friday.Ives set a price target of 60 on SolarWinds stock, which rose 31% in 2014 but has slipped more than 6% since Dec. 5.

It also bought N-able for $120 million in cash. N-able's customers — managed service providers — cater to small businesses.SolarWinds' acquisition spree is expected to continue in 2015.""Overall, we believe SolarWinds could see an inflection point in license growth for 2015 as it appears to be in the early innings of a major growth cycle and is uniquely positioned to benefit from a sweet spot of IT spending,"" wrote Ives.IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group ranks No. 38 out of 197 industry groups.

745,FFIV,"F5 Networks soared in 2014 and looks poised for another strong run this year. Demand is mounting for its security products as clients do more business via digital means and require heightened protection from hackers.Though not solely a security provider, Seattle-based F5 (FFIV) says that it is well-positioned to meet increasing needs on that front, needs amplified in 2014 by a range of breaches, from a cyberattack on banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to the infamous attack on Sony (SNE) and release of its executives' internal emails.Cooper Werner, F5's senior vice president of finance, told investors recently that the percentage of the company's product revenue tied to its security business reached 36% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It marked a 41% year-over-year jump.""Obviously, this is probably the biggest driver to our overall growth,"" Werner said while speaking at an investor conference hosted by Barclays in December.In its latest completed fiscal year, F5's revenue climbed 17% to $1.73 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project top-line growth of 13% for the current fiscal year.Upselling SafetyF5, whose clients include big online operators such as Facebook (FB) and Pandora Media (P), is the leading seller of application delivery controllers. ADCs are electronic devices that, in a nutshell, efficiently direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, enhancing the work processed in these areas and boosting website and communication network speeds.Werner said that F5 has worked to deepen business relationships with its ADC clients by also offering them data-center security products and services.In short, F5 views security ""as a natural extension of its ADC offerings, to help applications perform efficiently"" and make them ""more secure,"" as UBS analyst Amitabh Passi summed it up in a research note to clients.With demand now surging for data center protections, F5 finds itself at the center of what many observers expect will prove a long-running trend.""All it takes is a read of the headlines to see why demand for data security is on the rise and will continue to rise,"" BMO Private Bank Chief Investment Officer Jack Ablin told IBD.""I think that is the next frontier,"" Ablin said. He added that companies staking their ground now stand to be well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trend.F5's stock surged nearly 44% in 2014. It finished the final trading day of the year at $130 per share. It currently trades near 128.F5 is the No. 3 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 38 out of 197 groups that IBD tracks. The next largest players in the category are Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI). With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, F5 is one of the highest-rated companies in the Internet-Network Solutions group, topped only by Rackspace and SolarWinds, each of which gets a 99.A global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that information security breaches skyrocketed in 2014, leaping 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million detected incidents. Total financial losses attributed to security compromises jumped 34% over 2013, the PWC survey said.""The rise in security incidents would account for some of this increase in financial losses, of course. But another explanation might be that today's more sophisticated compromises often extend beyond IT to other areas of the business, and financial losses may now include remediation of more customer impacts and not just operational disruptions,"" PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report. Companies and organizations ""must remain vigilant and agile in the face of a continually evolving threat landscape.""GBT Capital Management Chairman Gary Townsend told IBD that cyberattack concerns are deepening and spreading across sectors, making security a top priority for companies of all sizes. ""One needs to be concerned about it everywhere,"" he said. ""No one is immune from attack.""Demand OutlookDeutsche Bank analysts said in a December note that their recent checks on F5 suggested ""no incremental slowdown in demand"" for the company's services, indicating that results for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 are likely to be strong. The analysts cited ""an expanding order pipeline"" for application and cloud-based security products from Fortune 500 companies.Depending on the traffic level and the number of servers needed to manage it, F5 charges between $50,000 and $300,000 for its ADCs. Competitors include Citrix Systems (CTXS) and A10 Networks (ATEN). F5 also sells virtual ADCs that run in clients' data centers as opposed to on F5's own hardware.Analysts on average anticipate that F5 will report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, which would be up 22% year over year, on sales of $467 million, which would be up 15%. The Deutsche Bank analysts anticipate that the momentum will continue. ""We see 2015 as a positive year,"" they wrote. The analysts have a buy rating on F5, with a $150 price target.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, recently raised his price target on F5 to $162 from $153 and kept an outperform rating. In a December research note, Bracelin cited F5's ""increasingly strategic positioning in security headed into the new year.""Acquisitions have augmented F5's growth. In 2014, the company bought Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services. And in 2013, it acquired Versafe, whose software guards Web applications from malware and fraud. Analysts anticipate more deals to come, providing an additional reason to expect growth.Speaking at the Barclays conference in December, Edward Eames, F5's executive vice president of business operations, said that the company could continue on the M&A path, with a focus on small, add-on deals.""I think we're very happy with the small technology purchase — and then fold that into the company and add it into our product line,"" Eames said.""And that's definitely the strategy we have going forward. So I don't think we'd be looking for larger M&A,"" he said. ""But yes, security, cloud — perhaps services and subscription around the two, as well — would all be focus areas, and we are continuing to look.""

757,FFIV,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Western Digital surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s prospects look bright. Additionally, the company’s expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts for Q3 results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Western Digital flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of 2.30%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.27, indicating an increase of 36.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up by a penny over the past seven days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $4.93 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?Western Digital has been expanding in the SSD storage market, bothered by the declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices over the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Over the last few months, the company rolled out the world’s smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the rising need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing, as well as third-party app integration.Western Digital also unveiled the My Cloud Home device that displays new voice-activated media streaming features through smart-home devices.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which, per the latest data by TechNavio, is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices which will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs, with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting its top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s expanding footprint in the automotive, as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as another key catalyst.Furthermore, Western Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and helped it gain traction in SSD.  Additionally, it has enabled the company to step into the NAND products market which, owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio as well.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Xilinx, Inc.

758,FFIV,"Fortinet Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.In the last-reported quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.3%. Notably, Fortinet has a strong earnings surprise history. The company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 20.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Fortinet is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.70%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 24 cents, which indicates a massive 41.2% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $390.8 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWe expect Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider to have driven the company’s bottom-line results in Q1. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generated more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 50-basis-point gross-margin expansion in 2017. We believe this strategy will continue to improve the company’s top and bottom-line performances.Nonetheless, the company’s sluggish revenue growth rate makes us cautious about its to-be-reported quarter top-line performance. Notably, over the last six quarters, the company’s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than the previous rates of more than 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s first-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 13.6-15.4%.The company observed that organizations have been breaking the cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above-mentioned factor is likely to have affected the first-quarter revenues, the negative impact of which might have trickled down the bottom as well.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

765,FFIV,"F5 Networks, Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is slated to release its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this Internet traffic manager will be able to post a positive earnings surprise  this time around.Notably, F5 Networks has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matched the same once and fallen short of it on one occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2.04, which represents a meager 3% increase from the year-ago figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $521.5 million, up just 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that F5 Networks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.F5 Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.05%.Factors to ConsiderA volatile spending environment and increasing competition remain headwinds for F5 Networks’ revenue growth. Notably, Cisco Systems (CSCO) poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Cisco has tremendous engineering and marketing resources at its disposal.Although F5 Networks’ technology leads in the networking market, Cisco has become more competitive, given its aggressive investment in this space. Additionally, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks, Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that are posing significant competitive threat.Also, F5 Networks continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, business mix and profitability, it also adds to integration risks. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which could impact organic growth in the long run.Nevertheless, improving software revenues and strength across all business segments along with its product refreshing initiatives are tailwinds. These are expected to expand the company’s total addressable market and aid revenue growth.Additionally, the company is also taking care of its management structure and added two names to its team during the quarter with an aim to improve operational efficiency. We might see the effect of this move in the soon-to-be reported quarter.F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc. Quote Some Stocks With a Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #2.

766,FFIV,"Shares of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) rallied to a 52-week high of $36.67, eventually closing a tad lower at $35.88 on Nov 16.The share price momentum can be primarily attributed to the company’s fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings that came ahead of expectations. The company’s encouraging guidance has also been one of the tailwinds.Cisco reported non-GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share in fiscal first-quarter 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Notably, revenues of $12.14 billion were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Acquisitions contributed 60 basis points (bps) to revenue growth in the quarter. Security and Applications revenues increased in the quarter.The company raised second-quarter fiscal 2018 guidance on the back of order strength and improving traction in the subscription-based model.Cisco stock has gained 18.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 11.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. Key FactorsNotably, Cisco’s wireless revenues were strong and demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution was solid during the first quarter. The company’s recently launched platform Cisco Intersight, aimed to simplify data center operations and a new portfolio of subscription offers called Business Critical and High Value Services powered by AI to predict future IT failures. These are anticipated to boost the top line going ahead.Management is optimistic about the new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform that has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers within a short span of time since its release. The continuing customer shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures is also another positive.Additionally, the company’s Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) solution is currently used by more than 4K customers. The ACI solution was recently enhanced with new features that have aided growth.The company’s collaboration with Telenor for the formation of WorkingGroupTwo (WG2) will provide a cloud solutions platform for assisting telecom operators in accelerating product innovation and marketing. This is expected to be a positive.Moreover, the company completed the acquisition of Springpath, Viptela and Observable Networks during the quarter, which will add to its top line. The company also announced its plans to acquire BroadSoft for $1.9 billion.We believe that all these factors have helped the company gain competitive edge against peers like Arista Networks (ANET  -  Free Report), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP  -  Free Report) and F5 Networks (FFIV  -  Free Report).Cisco Systems, Inc.

772,FFIV,"The earnings season has already started and the picture, so far, appears to be encouraging. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, nearly 53 of the S&P 500 members have reported their results. Out of these companies, approximately 81.1% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 75.5% surpassed top-line expectations.Notably, earnings for the 53 S&P 500 companies have advanced 11.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 7.5%. Further, the report suggests that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter are projected to improve 10.3% year over year, with total revenues increasing 7.1%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the six sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth. The other five are Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products, Construction and Autos. Various technology giants, including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector is benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How LRCX, TEL, APH, XLNX and FFIV are PlacedSupplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

773,FFIV,"Mobile devices, the chunky things that allowed us to take a call without getting up, were such a big deal just a few years ago. But as the days go by, they seem to be getting more and more capable, all the while becoming slimmer and cooler as well! No wonder then that today, they are being snapped up by kids, oldies and pretty much everyone in between.Considering their broad adoption and usefulness, one would have thought that there’d be a ton of companies out there, taking care of security as we browse the net, shop, play, socialize, read, watch video, listen to music, or work (or any of the other stuff I forgot to mention!). But that isn’t the way we function it seems because most individuals are comfortable enough even without security and have limited knowledge of the consequences. So mobile security hasn’t really gained momentum, even in places like the U.S., where 70%+ of the population has a device.Why Things Are Changing TodayThe first and biggest reason is the increasing usefulness of smart devices. Because these devices are always connected, they are more accessible to viruses, unsafe sites, etc. Moreover, people increasingly use them for shopping, entertainment, to consume media, or make payments, and tend to save passwords on the device itself. This also increases the danger of identity theft. The fact that they are moveable items that can easily be stolen or misplaced makes them all the more susceptible.So as the number of devices continues to increase, with smartphones, tablets, phablets, chromebooks, surfaces, smart watches, AR/VR devices, connected dashboards, smart  home products and other IoT devices, more information gets online with greater scope for infection or attacks. IDC expects smartphone shipments to grow 4.2% in 2017 and 4.4% in 2018 with a 3.8% CAGR over the 2016-2021 time period.Shipments are forecast to reach 1.53 billion units in 2017 and grow to 1.77 billion in 2021. Gartner expects global mobile phone shipments to grow less than a point this year and 1.6% in 2018 with the ongoing migration from feature phones to basic smartphones, especially from Chinese players, continuing.As the personal stuff on them continues to increase, they start moving some of it to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) or Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) cloud, meaning that increasingly, personal information is moving on the network, from where it might be tampered with. According to the Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) Visual Networking Index, global mobile data traffic grew 63% in 2016, of which video traffic accounted for 60%. The Middle East grew 96%, Asia/Pacific 71%, Latin America 66%, Central and Eastern Europe 64%, Western Europe 52% and North America 44%.It forecasts global mobile data traffic increase of 7x between 2016 and 2021, representing a 47% CAGR with nearly three-quarters of all devices on the network being smart by the end of the period. The Middle East will grow strongest at a 65% CAGR, followed by Asia/Pac at 49% and Latin America at 45%. China traffic will outpace the U.S. this year.The digitization of banking services and online storage of healthcare information are two megatrends that also increase the risk of information loss. In fact, these two segments deal with critical information and are therefore under greater pressure from both regulators and customers to maintain a high level of security and privacy.The virtualization of corporate workloads and bring your own device (BYOD) megatrend will completely change security as we know it. That’s because hackers (ransomware) and other Internet crooks can’t make as much money from individuals as they can from companies, governments and government bodies.Moreover, organizations have more to lose than individuals in case of data breaches (i.e. data, reputation, business loss from incapacitation), so they are more concerned about protection. In fact, companies like Microsoft and Google have regular hackathons to identify weaknesses in the programs they develop. So hacking has become good money.Security Stocks That Should Be on Your RadarMobile security companies are still in their startup phase and it is the established players like Cisco, Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report), VMware, Microsoft, McAfee, Infineon and Dell that are gradually increasing investment in the area. Security pureplays like Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Fortinet, F5 Networks (FFIV  -  Free Report), FireEye and Palo Alto are other stocks to watch. See how the industry did versus the S&P 500 year to date-Symantec is the only to buy right now since it has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been buying up mobile security companies of late.

776,FFIV,"On Aug 9, Zacks Investment Research downgraded F5 Networks, Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The downgrade can be primarily attributed to negative estimate revisions over the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has declined 1.1% to $6.28 over the said period. For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.87, reflecting a 5.1% decline over the same time frame.The negative estimate revision was primarily due to dismal third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, where both the top and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis of $1.55 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share.Moreover, revenues of $517.8 million missed the consensus mark of $525 million. It also fell short of the lower range of management’s guidance range of $520–$530 million. Disappointing fourth quarter revenue guidance also fumed pessimism over the stock’s growth prospect.We also note that F5 Networks has lost 18% of its value year to date against 17.3% growth of the industry.Challenges for the CompanyCisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) is the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Cisco has tremendous engineering and marketing resources at its disposal. Although F5 Networks’ technology leads in the networking market, Cisco could become more competitive if it invests aggressively. In addition, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report), Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution.Notably, F5 Networks continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, business mix and profitability, it also adds to integration risks. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which could impact organic growth in the long run.F5 Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) F5 Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | F5 Networks, Inc.

777,FFIV,"With the market making new high after new high, many are expecting this uptrend to continue well into 2015. 
"
778,FFIV,"Of course, there are others who are expecting the market to run out of steam and theyre concerned their individual stocks may be about to as well. 
"
779,FFIV,"But regardless of what you think may or may not happen to the market, everyone would like to have a better understanding of what their stock's potential price target is. And that's what we're going to talk about today.   
"
780,FFIV,"You can do this by using either technicals or fundamentals.  
"
781,FFIV,"Today, I'm going to focus on the fundamentals. 
"
782,FFIV,"And we're going to use the P/E ratio to calculate it. The P/E Ratio Can Tell You A Lot 
"
783,FFIV,"Many people use P/E ratios to determine a company's perceived under or overvaluation. 
"
784,FFIV,"But you can also use the P/E ratio to determine a stock's upside and downside price targets.  
"
785,FFIV,"The two most common P/E ratios used are the:  
"
786,FFIV,"1) P/Es using the Trailing 12 months (or 4 quarters) of earnings  
"
787,FFIV,"2) P/Es using the F1 (or Current Fiscal Year) Estimates
"
788,FFIV,"You can also use the P/E using 12 Month Forward EPS estimate. (Im actually partial to that one over the P/E using F1.)  
"
789,FFIV,"The calculation for the P/E ratio is simply price divided by earnings.  
"
790,FFIV,"For example: if a stock's price is $30 and its earnings are $1.25, its P/E would be 24. 
"
791,FFIV,"If that stock's earnings rose to $2.00, the P/E would now be lower at 15.
"
792,FFIV,"($30 price / $2.00 earnings = 15 P/E) 
"
793,FFIV,"And the most logical conclusion would be to see the stock's price rise until its most recent multiple (or P/E ratio) of 24 was hit again.  
"
794,FFIV,"Why is this so 'logical'? Because if people had just been willing to pay 24 times earnings, they probably will again if they believe the company's earnings will continue to improve.  
"
795,FFIV,"And in an environment where P/Es are increasing, they might be willing to pay even more.  
"
796,FFIV,"You'll also find that most of the time a stock's P/E ratio using EPS actuals is higher than its P/E ratio using its forward estimates.  
"
797,FFIV,"That's because of the uncertainty regarding the projected earnings vs. the certainty of actual earnings.  
"
798,FFIV,"As the company continues to report (and meet its projections), the forward P/E ratio typically increases, which means the stock price increases as the earnings projections are coming to fruition.  
"
799,FFIV,"And as more optimism grows over future earnings growth, you may see the P/E ratio grow even more, getting even higher than its previous multiple. Calculating the Price Target 
"
800,FFIV,"So, the calculation to figure out your stock's price target is below: Price x ((current P/E) / (forward P/E)) = future price (or price target)
"
801,FFIV,"In other words: let's say a stock's price was $50 and its current P/E was 20. Let's also say its forward P/E was 15.  
"
802,FFIV,"That's: $50 * (20 / 15) = $66.50 price target 
"
803,FFIV,"Another way of saying this would be: 15 goes into 20, 1.33 times. So $50 times 1.33 equals your price target of $66.50. Price Target Screen 
"
804,FFIV,"The screen I'm running today finds stocks with P/Es under their average P/E over the last 5 years and that also have price targets of at least 20% or more above their current price.  
"
805,FFIV,"The Parameters are:

825,FFIV,"Don Powers is somewhat of a chartist, who is partial to technology and does not believe in day trading. This investor looks for stocks that have the potential to at least double in a year. 
"
826,FFIV,"Dons investing prowess has so far guided his Simulator portfolio into the top 20 in the Zacks 4th Quarter Stock Challenge, with an overall return that is on the verge of hitting 40%. Some of his plays include Activision Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD), Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY  -  Free Report), Packeteer Inc. (PKTR) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report). Click here to view Dons entire trade history.What is his plan of attack? 
"
827,FFIV,"Typically I look for companies that are depressed due to temporary circumstances such as an acquisition, temporary disruption say due to supply delays, or delay in new product introductions etc. I am especially attracted to technology stocks where this happens often. I am an ardent believer in charting which helps me to locate bottoms and buy points, stated Don.
"
828,FFIV,"The stock market enthusiast added, Once I choose to buy a stock, I look at the sector, business, key statistics, concentration on ROE (return on equity), profitability, PEG, cash position and flow. Basically, there has to be growth or potential for growth. Don explained that the his picks have a high growth rate or are from growing sectors or, of course, both. 
"
829,FFIV,"Once this disciplined stock picker finds what he likes, he doesnt necessarily invest full throttle. Don commented, I invest 1/3 of my buy and watch for points of weakness to continue to add to my position. This enables me to accumulate a position over time. So once I make my first buy, I hope the stock goes down to be able to build the position. It make take a few days or months to build a position.Does he have a portfolio darling?
"
830,FFIV,"One stock that has generated the most bang for his buck is PKTR. This Simulator contender sees a lot of bullishness in this company. Don described PKTR, pointing out that it is the leader in WAN (wide area network) problems, controlling and analyzing traffic over the network. 
"
831,FFIV,"Because so many employees, students, etc. are downloading bigger and bigger files over their companys or school's network, traffic slowdown has become a major problem for all companies. PKTR has the only full solution for this problem, said Don. 
"
832,FFIV,"He went on to explain that other players in this field include Riverbed Technology, Inc. (RVBD), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) and F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report). However, according to Don, PKTR is the best buy in this arena. He noted, RVBD's valuation is 3x PKTR, yet they are half the size. PKTR is a screaming buy and should be selling in the high teens or in the twenties.  PKTR is and has been profitable and growing fast. Outlook for this sector is huge.What does the future hold? 
"
833,FFIV,"The election results have caused this market player to have a dimmer outlook on the market. Don mentioned that he is concerned about the tax situation in 2010 and the does not see a huge upswing for the Dow for the remainder of this year. 
"
834,FFIV,"He is, however, in the bullish camp when it comes to the Nasdaq and emerging markets, especially India, China, South Africa and Indonesia.Any advice?
"
835,FFIV,"My advise for someone new to investing  is to get a simple book on charting.  They are available in the book stores. There are some very basic patterns that anyone can learn.  It will help you to time your purchases and sales.  Use the simulator and practice, practice, practice.  You not need to day trade.  That is counter productive, takes too much time and in the end will not make you much money, replied Don.
"
836,FFIV,"The technology sector is poised to hog the spotlight as we head into the busiest week of the Q3 earnings cycle.According to the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members or 24.7% of the index’s total membership have reported quarterly results as of Oct 20. Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally see back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the four sectors which are expected to report strong earnings growth in the third quarter. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction.Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues for the third quarter.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies Poised to ShineThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s See How CA, CTXS and FFIV are PlacedCA Inc.’s (CA  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results seem to benefit from its acquisition and sales strategies. Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio.  Acquisitions have fortified its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. We believe the diversity of the company’s products and increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will entice customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Furthermore, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy helps generate sales while simultaneously slashing costs. However, heightening competition from Oracle, International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as adverse currency translations continue to be hurdles, and are expected to dent margins and sales in fiscal 2018. (Read: Buyout & Sale Strategies to Drive CA Inc's Q2 Earnings)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.6% in the trailing four quarters. CA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc. QuoteFurther, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents for the fiscal second quarter has remained unchanged in the last 30 days. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 3.2% from second-quarter fiscal 2017.Let’s take a sneak peek at Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. Citrix has an Earnings ESP of -0.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 for the third quarter remained unchanged in a month’s time.Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, in turn, hurting the top line. However, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are likely to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s total revenues is pegged at $691.2 million for the third quarter, down 17.8% from the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, we expect escalating costs to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to flare up. Personnel expenses are expected to shoot up as well, hurting the bottom line. In addition to this, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets. (Read: Will High Costs Mar Citrix Systems' Q3 Earnings?)Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteLastly, F5 Networks, Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report), a developer and provider of software defined application services, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results this Wednesday. The company has a mixed surprise history, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters, missing in one occasion and matching in the other. Nevertheless, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.It seems that in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s earnings will miss the Consensus Estimate as it has an ESP of -0.93% and Zacks Rank #4. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $536.8 million and $2.20, respectivelyF5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc. QuoteThe company’s top- and bottom-line performances are expected to be adversely affected by volatile spending atmosphere and competitive threats. Cisco Systems poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Additionally, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks, Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution. (Read: Factors Likely to Decide F5 Networks' Fate in Q4 Earnings)Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

837,FFIV,"F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a volatile spending atmosphere and competitive threats. This in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Last quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share. Moreover, F5 Networks’ revenues of $517.8 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525 million.Challenges for the CompanyCisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Cisco has tremendous engineering and marketing resources at its disposal. Although F5 Networks’ technology leads in the networking market, Cisco could become more competitive if it invests aggressively. Additionally, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks, Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution.Notably, F5 Networks continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, business mix and profitability, it also adds to integration risks. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which could impact organic growth in the long run.A substantial portion of the company’s sales is derived from outside the United States. Notably, the company garnered approximately 43.6%, 42.7% and 43.1% of total revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This exposes the company to exchange rate fluctuations and counterparty default risk. Consequently, an economic condition, which impacts foreign currency exchange rates, does result in transaction exposure, which leads to profit fluctuation.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues is currently pegged at $248 million, significantly down from $253 million reported in the year-ago quarter.F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that F5 Networksis likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.93% with the former currently pegged at $2.18 and the latter at $2.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: F5 Networkscarries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Total second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to increase 8.6% year over year, with 4.7% rise in revenues.Coming to technology, the sector has been a strong performer driven by solid demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.According to the report, total earnings of the tech sector are likely to be up 14.8% on 6.1% higher revenues for the first quarter.Let’s see what’s in store for three internet stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers on Jul 26.Facebook Inc is one of the most sought after stocks in the tech space and is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.59. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.95%.

839,FFIV,"F5 Networks (FFIV  -  Free Report) a leading provider of integrated Internet traffic and content management solutions, pre-announced negative results and guidance last week ahead of its April 24 earnings report. This surprise for investors caused shares to gap down 20% from $90 to $72 on April 5, trading over 12 million shares in the drop, nearly 8X the average daily volume.
"
840,FFIV,"For 2Q2013, F5 now expects revenues to be $350.2 million, significantly down from previously expected range of $370-$380 million. Management blamed slowing sales in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa for the dismal performance. From end market viewpoint, soft Telco and U.S. Federal bookings hampered revenue growth.
"
841,FFIV,"Lower revenues have also pulled down earnings per share expectations. F5 now expects GAAP earnings per share in the range of 79-80 cents, down from previously expected range of 93-96 cents. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be within $1.06 and $1.07 per share, down from prior expectation range of $1.21-$1.24.
"
842,FFIV,"In its earnings call, F5 expressed its concern about the macro uncertainties that could affect near-term fundamentals. Management also remained concerned about an expected budget cut from telecom customers.
"
843,FFIV,"Slashing the Estimates
"
844,FFIV,"Wall Street analysts who cover the company wasted no time in the past few days ""adjusting"" their revenue and EPS projections. The lowering of estimates was sufficiently deep and widespread to kick FFIV down to a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) last week and then to a #5 (Strong Sell) this week.
"
845,FFIV,"Since a good picture can tell even a bad story quickly, below is the Zacks proprietary Price & Consensus chart which plots annual earnings estimates against stock price.
"
846,FFIV,"You can see the immediate hit that the already-flat-lined 2013 and 2014 estimates took on the company's news. The kinks downward in those lines represent full-year EPS cuts of at least 11% for each.
"
847,FFIV,"The Distant, Cloudy Future
"
848,FFIV,"F5 hardware and systems are designed to improve the availability and performance of mission-critical Internet-based servers and applications. The company's products monitor and manage local and geographically dispersed servers and intelligently direct traffic to the server best able to handle a user's request. Their primary goal is to help prevent system failure and provide timely responses to user requests and data flow. 
"
849,FFIV,"One area of expansion is in the field of ""software-defined networking"" (SDN) is an approach to networking in which control moves from hardware to a software application called a controller. A network administrator uses these controllers to direct and regulate network traffic from a centralized hub.
"
850,FFIV,"This minimizes the use of different and expensive switches for controlling web-trafficking and helps in uninterrupted traffic flow. Another important factor for choosing SDN technology is that it is applicable for both private and public cloud infrastructures.
"
851,FFIV,"The SDN approach to networking is gaining popularity among key networking players such as Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report), and Brocade (BRCD).
"
852,FFIV,"Bottom line: While F5 is a key player in the technologies of Internet traffic flow, their revenue and earnings outlooks have hit a major traffic jam. Until the congestion clears and analysts start raising estimates again, its probably best to find another route.
