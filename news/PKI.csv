2,PKI,"A bean counter can keep your books, but can the man behind the green eyeshade make your investments grow? CPA-trained Jim Tringas, co-lead manager of $1.9 billion Wells Fargo Special Small Cap Value Fund (ESPAX), sure can.Of 1,104 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade ended Dec. 31, as tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 44 managed to beat the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. Those funds are IBD's 2017 Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. And Special Small Cap Value is one of them. The fund was up just 0.4% year-to-date going into Thursday, but it was running ahead of its small-cap value peers in a stock market environment that's now favoring large-cap growth stocks.Tringas and his co-managers know they can count on such slack times and have a proven way for handling them. ""The key to our success is in not trying to hit home runs,"" Tringas said. ""It's in just trying to get on base. Maybe hit a single, maybe draw a walk. Then we just try to get to second base, then third, then home. And not giving up a lot of runs.""Tringas says the fund's focus on winning by doing a lot of little things right stems from the training that he and fellow co-lead manager Bryant VanCronkhite share. Both started out as certified public accountants. ""With CPA backgrounds, we have a more conservative, cautious approach than most fund managers,"" Tringas said. ""So we don't take a lot of risk. We don't take shareholders on a harrowing ride. We aim for smooth performance over time. And we do it in a way that beats peers and benchmarks with less volatility than many other funds. We get to the end point with a nicer ride.""Their co-manager, Robert Rifkin, shares their approach despite not having a CPA background.Take a look at some of their top performers among their top-25 holdings.  Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion-control systems, is up 35%. DST Systems (DST), which makes software for the financial services industry, is up 16%. Containers manufacturer Silgan Holdings (SLGN), is up 19%.Tringas, who is about to turn 51 and who has managed Wells Fargo Special Small Cap Value since 2002, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Boston.IBD: What does the ""special"" in your fund's name refer to?Tringas: I get that question a lot. When the fund was set up in 1993, the word was used a lot. It was originally part of the Wachovia Evergreen fund family, which got acquired by First Union (in 2001). The acquiring company already had a fund named Small Cap Value, so they couldn't drop the ""Special."" (Wells Fargo then acquired Wachovia in 2008.)Now, when we speak to one another, we ask what's special about a stock we're considering buying. That's our code for: What's its competitive advantage? That's its special sauce, if you will.The second thing we look for is recurring free cash flow. The third thing we look for is a flexible balance sheet. That means they're underleveraged. We look for companies with low or no debt. They can use their financial flexibility to create value. They can create shareholder returns, they can invest organically in a new plant or a technology platform to enable them to improve working capital and increase margins over time.IBD: What is the key to this fund's consistent outperformance?Tringas: It comes down to focusing on the things we've discussed: portfolio construction and paying attention to risk. It's in risky environments where we distinguish ourselves. If we have a portfolio of companies that are high quality, generate a lot of free cash flow and (carry) little or no debt, those are the companies that investors want to buy when the market sells off.Our companies hold up much better when the market sells off. They operate from a position of strength. We usually outperform in those markets.IBD: Let's talk about your theses for interesting holdings as of your latest disclosure. You've been building your share count in Central Garden & Pet (CENT) for several disclosures. What's the attraction?Tringas: It's a turnaround. For about 10 years they went nowhere. Management teams came and went. But what had us excited is that they are not capital intensive. Their end markets have seasonality, but they are attractive. Management there today has improved distribution and rationalized the number of products, bringing out their potential.They barely made money in 2012 through 2014. This year they should make $1.40 to $1.50 a share. As a company fixes its inefficiencies, it has more ability to create value. I'm not saying at the current price it's awesome. But we have a lower cost basis.IBD: You've also added to your stake in Novanta. Why is that?Tringas: They make lasers or laser-based systems for machine-cutting tools or for high-precision surgical applications.They work with customers to create a tool for that customer. So they are essentially a sole-source supplier. And as things wear out, they get follow-on orders. Also, (some top management) came from PerkinElmer (PKI), a medical research equipment company. So Novanta began to tilt toward medical-care markets, which is less cyclical than their (nonmedical-care markets). Now revenues are about fifty-fifty from medical end markets and other end markets. Our models show there are still substantial opportunities for them to continue this value-creating strategy.IBD: Executive headhunter Korn Ferry (KFY) is yet another name you've added to. Why do you like it?Tringas: They have great relationships with executives they've helped place at Fortune 500 companies, and it's natural to serve them now. They've done a smart job of diversifying into a consulting-type businesses. That provides more recurring revenue than their core executive recruiting.With more stable cash flow, they get more access to cheaper borrowing, so they have more opportunities to create value through a flexible balance sheet.The risk is that if we get a recession, their executive recruiting business will be hard hit.IBD'S TAKE: Korn Ferry ranks No. 2 in IBD's Commercial Services-Staffing industry group. Its top-notch SMR Rating of A from IBD means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against that of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.IBD: DSP Group (DSPG) is a small designer of wireless chipsets. Is this a play on an overlooked gem?Tringas: They're not on anyone's radar screen. They're run by an Israeli management team and have a phenomenal balance sheet. They have a lot of new products that we believe are targeted for mobile phones and wearable devices, including speech recognition and audio technology, that are unique and valuable.They're profitable now. And to the extent that they can monetize new markets, they could be even more interesting.IBD: Mueller Industries (MLI) makes copper and brass tubes for the HVAC, refrigeration and plumbing markets. Where's the sex appeal?Tringas: They're not sexy, they just make money. Their products go into residential and nonresidential end markets. If the economy grows 2%, give or take, that's good enough to let them grow earnings. And they paid a special dividend of $8 per share (in March), so they're good stewards of capital who rewarded long-term shareholders.If there is an infrastructure buildout, it will create demand for the things they sell.IBD: Earnings per share growth for Associated Banc (ASB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What else do you like about it?Tringas: The CEO is Phil Flynn. He sold Union Bank in 2008 when we owned it. We believe he knows how to turn around a franchise. When he came in, this company was on the verge of failure. It's doing better. We believe this company will be sold. We have no idea when. The likely buyers are Canadian banks because Associated is in the upper Midwest and would give them a foothold in the U.S.IBD: Atkore International Group (ATKR), a construction products maker, is a newcomer to your portfolio. What's your play?Tringas: They have similar end markets to Mueller. They also have a mechanical products and services division.They generate an enormous amount of cash flow. Companies that come out of private equity generally are well run. When they go public, they still have their discipline. Companies like this don't have a flexible balance sheet, but this has enough free cash flow that it continues to deliver and can add value to shareholders over time, and it is reasonably priced.IBD: Hancock Holding's (HBHC) EPS grew 13%, 237% and 633% the past three quarters. Is this a rebound story for a bank exposed to energy companies?Tringas: This is a Southeastern bank with exposure to energy. When oil went to $26 a barrel from $80, they had issues with risky and nonperforming loans. But oil has come back. Nonperforming loans on their books are down a lot. A lot of those companies shored up their balance sheets through equity offerings.IBD: Jim, how often do you talk buys and sells with your team?Tringas: There are ad hoc conversations initiated by analysts coming to me, saying this or that stock is getting rich, the risk-reward ratio is telling me we need to cut the weight. Doesn't mean we'll do it, but we talk about it.We have a regular weekly meeting every Thursday, where we discuss buys and sells. It's amazing how much macro conversation happens for bottom-up guys like us.RELATED:Blue-Chip Tech Names Help Fuel This Red-Hot FundFidelity's Will Danoff Talks About The Super Bowl And Super Stocks

"
37,PKI,"Gene-sequencing instruments now can spit out so much data that some researchers are turning to cloud computing to handle the load — lifting the outlook for providers of such services.
"
38,PKI,"PerkinElmer (PKI), a maker of scientific instruments, is one such company. It's expanding its services business and recently acquired Geospiza, a provider of lab software and cloud-based genomic data services.
"
39,PKI,"PerkinElmer aims to provide more storage and analysis services via the cloud, as faster and less-costly instruments let more labs sequence DNA.
"
40,PKI,"""There has been a lot of data generated,"" said Dan Marshak, Perkin-Elmer's chief scientific officer. ""We are in early days.""
"
41,PKI,"The tipping point for high-volume sequencing came a few years ago, when companies such as Illumina (ILMN) and Life Technologies (LIFE) released next-generation sequencing instruments.
"
42,PKI,"With the new technology, sequencing an entire human genome can now be done for $5,000- $10,000 over several days, compared with millions of dollars and several months 10 years ago.
"
43,PKI,"Researchers also demand data redundancies to ensure they don't miss a single gene, so an individual genome is typically sequenced 30 to 40 times, further adding to the data pile.
"
44,PKI,"This, plus the lower barriers to entry afforded by the new instruments, has resulted in the amount of genomic data quintupling each year.
"
45,PKI,"""There's a data wave occurring,"" said Paul Knight, an analyst at investment firm CLSA. ""The cloud is essential.""
"
46,PKI,"More Advanced Instruments
"
47,PKI,"As scientific instruments become more advanced, instrument makers are under growing pressure to provide more data analysis or cloud access to help their customers cope with the volume of data generated, Knight says.
"
48,PKI,"""It's an emerging issue,"" he said.
"
49,PKI,"Illumina a few years ago began offering a servers-storage-services package to manage its customers' sequencing data. Reportedly, it is planning a cloud service as well.
"
50,PKI,"The cloud, though, has its challenges. That was evident when the cloud service offered by Amazon.com (AMZN) had several days of outages in late April, knocking some big websites such as Foursquare out of commission for periods of time. That incident might lessen the cloud's appeal to scientists already nervous about handing over their precious data.
"
51,PKI,"But lack of storage and analysis services for genomic data isn't the only issue. Labs face similar data problems with research on proteins and human cells.
"
52,PKI,"And the next generation of instruments likely will only worsen the problem, as sequencing technology advances faster than computing technology.
"
53,PKI,"Just storing data on the cloud isn't enough. In order to be used effectively, data must be analyzed and presented in an easy-to-use way, especially if a group of people will share access to it.
"
54,PKI,"""A vendor that can provide that experience in a simple environment is going to be able to capture a large share of that market, no doubt about it,"" said Michael Schatz, a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, during a CLSA industry forum this year.
"
55,PKI,"DNA Analysis Often Key
"
56,PKI,"Ease of use will grow in importance as more researchers delve into DNA sequencing for the first time, due in part, says PerkinElmer, to drug development increasingly requiring DNA and protein analysis.
"
57,PKI,"As part of its cloud-based services, PerkinElmer will do some initial analysis work as well as walk researchers through the process of sequencing DNA, says Dick Begley, the company's president of emerging technologies.
"
58,PKI,"""We will interactively coach them,"" he said.
"
59,PKI,"The University of Florida's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research has used Geospiza since 1999, first for its software, then for its cloud services starting in 2009, when the data wave began building.
"
60,PKI,"The center provides sequencing services for researchers at the university and elsewhere and didn't want to devote its own staff to building a more efficient user interface, says William Farmerie, the center's associate director of emerging science.
"
61,PKI,"""You need to make their access to the data as convenient as possible,"" he said. ""If you have rows of data in a spreadsheet, that's mind-numbing.""
"
62,PKI,"The cloud-based service also lets researchers reorganize the data any way they want, rather than the center having to produce another custom-made product with each individual request, he said.
"
63,PKI,"Still, cloud computing may not be a cure-all for the research center's data issues. Farmerie said he's also considering adding more servers.

""We are in early days.""The tipping point for high-volume sequencing came a few years ago, when companies such as Illumina (ILMN) and Life Technologies (LIFE) released next-generation sequencing instruments.With the new technology, sequencing an entire human genome can now be done for $5,000- $10,000 over several days, compared with millions of dollars and several months 10 years ago.Researchers also demand data redundancies to ensure they don't miss a single gene, so an individual genome is typically sequenced 30 to 40 times, further adding to the data pile.This, plus the lower barriers to entry afforded by the new instruments, has resulted in the amount of genomic data quintupling each year.""There's a data wave occurring,"" said Paul Knight, an analyst at investment firm CLSA. ""The cloud is essential.""More Advanced InstrumentsAs scientific instruments become more advanced, instrument makers are under growing pressure to provide more data analysis or cloud access to help their customers cope with the volume of data generated, Knight says.""It's an emerging issue,"" he said.Illumina a few years ago began offering a servers-storage-services package to manage its customers' sequencing data. Reportedly, it is planning a cloud service as well.The cloud, though, has its challenges. That was evident when the cloud service offered by Amazon.com (AMZN) had several days of outages in late April, knocking some big websites such as Foursquare out of commission for periods of time. That incident might lessen the cloud's appeal to scientists already nervous about handing over their precious data.But lack of storage and analysis services for genomic data isn't the only issue. Labs face similar data problems with research on proteins and human cells.And the next generation of instruments likely will only worsen the problem, as sequencing technology advances faster than computing technology.Just storing data on the cloud isn't enough. In order to be used effectively, data must be analyzed and presented in an easy-to-use way, especially if a group of people will share access to it.""A vendor that can provide that experience in a simple environment is going to be able to capture a large share of that market, no doubt about it,"" said Michael Schatz, a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, during a CLSA industry forum this year.DNA Analysis Often KeyEase of use will grow in importance as more researchers delve into DNA sequencing for the first time, due in part, says PerkinElmer, to drug development increasingly requiring DNA and protein analysis.As part of its cloud-based services, PerkinElmer will do some initial analysis work as well as walk researchers through the process of sequencing DNA, says Dick Begley, the company's president of emerging technologies.""We will interactively coach them,"" he said.The University of Florida's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research has used Geospiza since 1999, first for its software, then for its cloud services starting in 2009, when the data wave began building.The center provides sequencing services for researchers at the university and elsewhere and didn't want to devote its own staff to building a more efficient user interface, says William Farmerie, the center's associate director of emerging science.""You need to make their access to the data as convenient as possible,"" he said. ""If you have rows of data in a spreadsheet, that's mind-numbing.""The cloud-based service also lets researchers reorganize the data any way they want, rather than the center having to produce another custom-made product with each individual request, he said.Still, cloud computing may not be a cure-all for the research center's data issues. Farmerie said he's also considering adding more servers.""I'm looking at every possible solution I can get my hands on,"" he said.

151,PKI,"In a bid to strengthen its CAD-CAM-based dental unit, DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report), recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire OraMetrix — a leading industry provider of innovative 3-D technology solutions.The company also offers an advanced, CAD platform developed for dental professionals to deliver consistently predictable orthodontic outcomes.The transaction is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2018.What is CAD-CAM?DENTSPLY’s CAD/CAM is a dental imaging platform and a major foundation in global dental markets.CAD/CAM is a field of dental supplies and prosthodontics using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing technologies.In fact, the dental supplies market looks promising at the moment. Over the last 10 years, the market has gained 119.8% compared with the S&P 500 Index’s rally of 101.4%.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Deal in DetailFinancial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps by DENTSPLY.Post the acquisition, the company will be able to provide an end-to-end digital workflow to dental professionals and address the increasing demands for aesthetics. The acquisition of OraMetrix is likely to strengthen DENTSPLY’s footprint in the global dental industry.Notably, the company announced its plans to broaden OraMetrix’ technologies and services post the buyout. For this, DENTSPLY is likely to incur additional investments and expenses which will be dilutive to overall earnings per share in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, OraMetrix posted revenues of approximately $20 million in 2017.The acquisition is likely to bolster the company’s Technologies & Equipment segment. This segment consists of dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products. In the fourth quarter of 2017, sales improved 10.4% to $630.2 million in the segment and 5.8% at cc.In fact, the acquisition will introduce a comprehensive orthodontic offering that will include a ‘full arch clear-aligner’ solution for DENTSPLY.ConclusionDENTSPLY has been one of the underperforming companies in the MedTech space. Lackluster margin trends, declining earnings and foreign exchange headwinds have been plaguing the company. However, per a research report by Technavio, the global dental CAD/CAM market will witness a CAGR of more than 8% by 2021. We believe that DENTSPLY is striving to overcome these problems with such deals.The company’s price performance has been dull as well. DENTSPLY’s shares have lost 15.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3% in a year’s time. Interestingly, an uptick in its share price was witnessed post the announcement of OraMetrix’s buyout. Notably, shares of DENTSPLY have inched up 0.8% to close at $51.10 following the press release.Further, the company’s agreements with MedTech bigwigs like Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. Recently, DENTSPLY witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

155,PKI,"On Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).As an operating division of DaVita, DaVita Kidney Care focuses on setting global standards for clinical, social and operational practices in kidney care. However, the company has been grappling with labor-union issues in California and Ohio.Davita’s kidney care unit has been gaining prominence worldwide. Of the major services that it provides, the in-center hemodialysis, home hemodyalisis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, urology, diabetology and vascular access surgery deserve a mention.In the fourth quarter of 2017, net consolidated revenues in the kidney care unit were $2.78 billion, up 3% year over year. Adjusted operating income in the segment was $430 million, up 1.8% year over year.Further, DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers.These are anticipated to help DaVita deliver more efficient patient care. Currently, DaVita is seeking to expand in major European and Asian countries via acquisitions and partnerships.Meanwhile, in California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant one-time costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts.

157,PKI,"On Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). While increasing demand for PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and specialty pharmacy was a major growth driver for the stock, its dull retail performance over the last few quarters seems to have disappointed investors. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has lost 19% compared with the 20.1% decrease of the broader industry. Notably, CVS Health exited the fourth quarter 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and revenues remaining ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A year-over-year rise in the top line was owing to a strong Pharmacy Services segment, having benefited from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy.The company’s sturdy 2018 PBM selling season is another growth-booster. On another positive note, the company is already making  a decent progress with its 2019 selling season. Good news is that it has been banking on gross wins of approximately $6.2 billion and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%.Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the company’s commencement of the momentous $69-billion healthcare consolidation with the U.S. health insurance giant, Aetna. On successful completion of the deal, CVS Health expects to earn $750 million from near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Moreover, Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts are gradually driving enterprise value at CVS Health. Further, management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. Additionally, we expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern as it faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. This apart, CVS Health has delivered some sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

In this regard, revenues increased 7% on a year-over-year basis and reached $17.9 billion. The improvement can be attributed to strong performance in Health Care Services. Further, management forecasts an increase in revenues in tune with organic growth and acquisitions. At the same time, the company expects high single-digit annual growth in net income by 2020.In addition to the stock’s impressive performance in its core dialysis business, Fresenius Medical intends to achieve the 2020 targets by expanding Care Coordination (non-dialysis segment) as well.By the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reconfirmed the mid-term outlook of its Growth Strategy 2020.Global Efficiency Program Phase II: Fresenius Medical launched the second phase of its Global Efficiency Program (GEP II) in 2018.

160,PKI,"On Mar 20, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into the adjacent markets and strengthen its core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, raising a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has surged 38.5% compared with the industry’s 25.9% rally. STERIS exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. However, we are encouraged by the favorable underlying market trends along with new product and service offerings. The company’s organic growth was strong across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments.We are particularly upbeat about STERIS’ series of six acquisitions in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Through these buyouts, the company aims to strengthen the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. Furthermore, financed by both cash in hand and credit facility borrowings, the company had to incur acquisition cost of around $51.6 million, net of cash acquired, including a contingent consideration of $5.3 million.We think this developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction and surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services can pursue back-to-back acquisitions in the long run to expand business and customer base, courtesy of its strong financial position.We are also impressed by the company’s recent organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. Additionally, we expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies boasting extensive product portfolios and a wide global reach as well as several small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company expects to confront intense competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, many STERIS’ customers are undergoing consolidation, partly owing to healthcare cost-reduction measures initiated by peer pressure as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We believe, if the company fails to check the customer consolidation rate right now, then it might affect its business as well as the financial standing.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

161,PKI,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings or LabCorp (LH  -  Free Report) has recently entered into a national agreement with Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (IDXG  -  Free Report) in the field of cytopathology. On one hand, this win-win alliance will expand Interpace’s nationwide network of cytology providers, supporting its Thyroid molecular business unit. While on the other, it will be helpful in strengthening LabCorp’s core specialty diagnostics arm.Notably, this is not the first time that LabCorp has partnered with Interpace. In fact, this latest agreement builds upon the original deal inked in 2016. The earlier contract enabled electronic ordering and result reporting via LabCorp for the Interpace’s proprietary ThyGenX and ThyraMIR tests. The reports provided more specific diagnostic information about the presence of thyroid cancer in patients, whose initial biopsy fails to indicate if a thyroid nodule is malignant or benign.Under the new agreement, Dianon Pathology — a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group — will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis. If the result is indeterminate, then Interpace will perform the molecular tests. This apart, doctors can order an automatic reflex to Interpace’s tests from Dianon in the event of an indefinite biopsy assessment. In either case, Dianon will automatically refer those samples to Interpace to perform the company’s proprietary assays, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR.It is important to note that LabCorp works hard on new innovations with academic institutions as part of its three key strategic plans to capture the growing lab testing market through advanced assays and tools.In Diagnostics, the company successfully continues to provide foundation for new collaborations with health systems, large physician groups and managed care partners.  It constantly increases its scale and competency levels in clinical laboratory medicine by resorting to acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing.Among the company’s other recent tie-ups, worth mentioning are its two major health systems partnerships namely Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, a Pacific Northwest-based market-leading reference and outreach laboratory.Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually become research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator and patient recruitment capabilities.LabCorp has also created ample growth opportunities for women's health with medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing as well as effected critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe. Also, its partnerships with Mount Sinai and PAML's former owners, Providence and Catholic Health, continue to expand.Additionally, LabCorp expects the above three transactions to benefit from full-year ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million in incremental profitable revenues for 2018.Share Price Performance Over the past three months, shares of LabCorp have outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 6.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.1%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This huge downside resulted from the company’s shift in strategy to focus on growing its core revenue mix. This apart, the impact of the Cures Act and contract modifications with UnitedHealthcare (completed as of Sep 30, 2017) were major deterrents.  However, the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $172 million.BioScrip, Inc.

The company also expects 2018 capital expenditures between $12 million and $14 million.Our TakeBioScrip exited the fourth quarter on a dismal note with lower-than-expected earnings performances. Although, revenues were above the consensus mark, the huge year-over-year decline was a disappointment.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in the fourth quarter, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan to improve the financial position. The company also expects core revenues at Home Solutions and continued core growth to be accretive to its portfolio. Moreover, we are upbeat about BioScrip’s completion of the UnitedHealthcare contract transition and projections of core revenue rise.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).BioScrip exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a dismal note with lower-than-expected earnings performance. Although, revenues were above the consensus mark, the huge year-over-year decline was a disappointment. This downside was due to a shift in the company’s strategy to solely focus on growing core revenue mix including contract changes with United Healthcare, which were completed as of September 30, 2017.Also, external challenges like reimbursement cuts persisting throughout 2017 pertaining to the 21st century Cures Act hampered growth. Full-year result was thus discouraging as a result of the catastrophic disruption from hurricanes Irma and Harvey in the third quarter besides the Cures Act reimbursement cuts.In the past three months, shares of BioScrip have underperformed the broader industry.

(COO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $2.79 in first-quarter fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.7% and increasing 44.6% year over year. We believe the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Revenues increased 4% at constant currency exchange rate (CER) on a year-over-year basis to $590 million. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $582.1 million. The stellar top-line performance was driven by silicone hydrogel lenses, led by the Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space.Segmental AnalysisThe company has two business segments — CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).The Cooper Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Cooper Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Cooper Companies, Inc. QuoteCVIRevenues at CooperVision Segment increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $444.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment continues to gain from the company’s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (11%), single-use sphere lenses (26%) and non single-use sphere lenses (32%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 5% year over year at cc to $46.9 million, while Toric revenues increased 9% to $137.8 million. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 11% at cc to $116.3 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses rose 4% to $143.8 million.Geographically, CVI revenues inched up 3% in the Americas and a respective 15% and 9% in the Asia Pacific and EMEA, at cc.CSIRevenues at CooperSurgical Segment declined 6% at cc to $145.2 million on a year-over-year basis. However, the company witnessed 32% increase in this segment on a reported basis on the back of the PARAGARD acquisition. The fertility category (39% of CSI revenues) saw a 5% drop in sales at cc to $57 million. Also, the office and surgical products category declined 6% at cc to $88.2 million.Margin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CSI segment was 69% in the reported quarter, up 700 basis points (bps) year over year. The margin was negatively impacted by the inventory step-up associated with the PARAGARD buyout.As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CVI segment was 67% in the reported quarter, higher than 63% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. This reflects an increase of 400 bps on f avorable currency and product mix.Hence, adjusted gross margin as a whole for Cooper Companies was 68% of revenues, up 500 bps year over year.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 28% of net revenues in the fiscal first quarter, up 500 bps on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, total revenues are now expected in the band of $2,510-$2,560 million compared with the previous $2,480-$2,530 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings stands at $11.57, below the guided range.Our TakeCooper Companies ended first-quarter fiscal 2018 on a solid note. The company’s CooperVision business has always been posting impressive results. The company’s raised guidance for fiscal 2018 is promising. However, intense competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.Notably, Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences. This added a leading ortho-k technology to the company’s lens portfolio. Considering the outstanding performance of the stock, we expect Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters.

169,PKI,"As a major breakthrough in the field of PhysioStim, Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) has secured approvals from the U.S. FDA as well as the European CE Mark for its next-generation PhysioStim.Per the company, the PhysioStim bone growth stimulators provide a non-surgical treatment option, particularly to patients with nonunion fracture beyond repair. In fact, such extremely critical conditions show no visible signs of healing.The aforementioned Class III medical devices are built on Orthofix’s proprietary pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) technology platform.  According to the company, PEMF signal creates a low-level electrical field at the fracture site, stimulating bone healing.          Orthofix sounds highly positive about PhysioStim, claiming the devices to have occupied a leading position as prescribed bone growth stimulators in the United States combined with spinal fusion stimulators. The company also stated that the PhysioStim devices will be accompanied by STIM onTrack, a new application for mobile devices. This app uses a first-to-market feature enabling physicians to remotely track and view patient adherence to their prescription.Huge Market ProspectWe are certainly looking forward to this path-breaking achievement by the musculoskeletal healing device company in bone growth stimulation space, showing all indications to grow in leaps and bounds.Going by a Grand View research report, the bone growth stimulator market size was valued at $1 billion in 2016 with more than 50 million Americans suffering arthritis. With arthritic problems rapidly rising due to aging and obesity factors, the patient population is likely to increasingly reach 78.4 million by 2040. Needless to add that this endemic arthritis is driving demand for bone growth stimulation products.Taking global data into consideration, a Markets and Markets report states that the global bone growth stimulator market is estimated at $1.41 billion by 2022, witnessing a CAGR of 5.4%. The major growth propellers are growing patient preference for non-invasive and minimally invasive surgical treatments, increasing target patient population and procedural benefits offered by bone stimulation devices in bone fracture treatments.In view of the above, we expect Orthofix to achieve a huge customer adoption rate for PhysioStim post the product launch in the United States and Europe.Price Performance Over the past three months, shares of Orthofix have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 11% compared with the industry’s 5.5% rise.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

170,PKI,"In a bid to make genomic research cost-effective,Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (PACB  -  Free Report) recently announced a new version of Sequel Software (V5.1) and a new polymerase.Pacific Biosciences’ flagship platform — the Sequel System — has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide.With the latest development, the Sequel System can now achieve up to 10 Gb per Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Cell for genomic libraries, doubling the throughput when using ultra-long inserts (>40 kb) for de novo genome assembly.These enhancements increase throughput and the overall performance of SMRT Sequencing for key applications. Notably, Pacific Biosciences has increased the throughput per SMRT Cell 1000-fold since the SMRT Sequencing technology was first commercialized in 2011. This throughput increases cost-effectiveness for sequencing projects in the human, plant and animal markets, enabling researchers to increase the size and scope of their projects.Sequel System at a GlanceSequel System is a nucleic acid sequencing platform based on SMRT technology that was developed in partnership with Roche. Though Pacific Bioscience’s agreement with Roche was terminated in 2016, the Sequel System is still a significant contributor to Pacific Bioscience’s top line.We believe that the Sequel System’s higher throughput, scalability, lower upfront capital investment as well as smaller size and weight will attract cost-sensitive customers.In the fourth quarter of 2017, consumable revenue growth was driven by higher sequel instrument utilization. The average annualized pull through revenues on sequel instruments was more than $180,000 and is nearing $200,000.Recent DevelopmentsIn January 2018, Pacific Biosciences announced an agreement with BGI Genomics to purchase an additional 10 Sequel Systems. This will significantly expand the capacity for SMRT Sequencing for BGI’s global sequencing service business, which currently operates two Sequel Systems and a PacBio RS II Sequencing System.In October 2017, Pacific Biosciences of California formed an alliance with genomic data-driven medicine company, Bluebee, to develop an advanced de novo assembly pipeline that integrates both the company’s technologies.The company is alsocontinuing to work on the new version of the eight million ZMW SMRT Cell. The company has also expressed its plans to complete the developmental chip by the end of this year.Notably, the company has received an order for 10 sequel systems from BGI in China, which is expected to further strengthen its foothold in the country.Also, by the end of 2017, Pacific Biosciences confirmed that it is on track to perform beta testing on new enzyme and software for the Sequel Systems.Industry ProspectsPer Markets And Markets, the global Genomics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.2% to reach a worth of $23.88 Billion by 2022.  Consequently, the prospects of long-read sequencing market, a niche space in the genomics industry, is also growing in leaps and bounds. We believe, Pacific Biosciences’ slew of latest developments to be well-timed within this industry.Further, per a recent report by Decisive Bio-Insights, the Next Generation Sequencing manufacturer market size will reach $3.2 billion in 2017 and grow at 12% per annum rate to touch $4.6 billion by 2020, primarily driven by adoption from worldwide clinical customers.Price Performance Over the past month, the stock has gained than 9.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 7.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPacific Biosciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

171,PKI,"Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 11.4% compared with the industry’s 8.7%. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 2.9% gain.This renowned home health and hospice services provider has a market cap of $1.85 billion. The company’s five-year projected growth rate is favorable at 19.5% compared with the industry’s 13.4%.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, eight analysts revised their estimates upward with no movement in the opposite direction. Resultantly, earnings estimates increased around 19.4% to $3.01 per share.  Per our Style Score, Amedisys sports a Growth Score of B which is reflective of the company’s strong prospects. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best upside potential.Additionally, the company exhibits a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Per our research, VGM Score is simply a weighted combination of these parameters and is a comprehensive tool that allows investors to filter through the standard scoring system and pick the winning stocks.In this regard, Amedisys has a favorable annualized projected earnings growth rate of 36.3% compared with the industry’s 23.3%. The company’s sales to assets ratio of 1.93 versus the industry’s 1.04 signifies that it is a solid growth pick.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Looking at Amedisys’ solid fourth-quarter 2017 results in terms of both earnings and revenues, we are encouraged by the company’s long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to one that is focused on bringing home a continuum of care. This is because Amedisys intends to better serve patients and diversify sources of payment so as to become less reliant on Medicare. In this regard, the company witnessed encouraging growth in Medicare and non-Medicare revenues at the Home Health and Hospice divisions in fourth-quarter 2017.We are upbeat about Amedisys’ strategic acquisitions over the past year. In this regard, the latest buyout has been that of Intercity Home Care, a personal care provider headquartered in Malden, MA. With this, the renowned home health and hospice services provider has a wider presence in Massachusetts.We also note that, the home health industry is poised to grow significantly in the near term driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. Meanwhile, Amedisys should continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and home health as a cheaper care modality. In addition, with continued pressure on the U.S. healthcare system, we believe operators such as Amedisys will continue to benefit from increased volume shift from higher-cost institutional settings to a lower-cost environment such as home health.We are also optimistic about the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 by the Congress, which reduces the company’s 2018 reimbursement impact from 1.4% to 0.7%.Furthermore, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flip side, escalating operating expenses continue to pose threat. Also, an intensely competitive landscape and regulatory concerns are major bottlenecks for the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and athenahealth, Inc.

172,PKI,"On Mar 7, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report). Amid huge reimbursement concerns, the company focuses on potentially strong areas. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Quest Diagnostics have outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has gained 6.6% against the broader industry’s 2.2% decline. We are encouraged to note that in recent times, Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. The company lends attention to core diagnostic information services business as well as disciplined capital deployment.Its several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are looking forward to the company’s recently-closed buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service, a national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services. This apart, the 2018 guidance issued promises this bullish trend to continue.Later in 2016, Quest Diagnostics provided an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholder value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.This major commercial laboratory services provider expects 3-5% revenue growth for the period from 2017 to 2020. However, the bottom-line rise is expected to better the top line at a faster rate in mid-to-high single-digit range. Per the company, its increasing partnership strength with other health care leaders is creating ample opportunities for earnings and revenue boost while simultaneously, improving the patient experience as well as reducing the overall cost of care.After enduring several quarters of dull volumes, the company has finally noticed improvement in terms of both volume and pricing. However, sustainability of this progress is still doubted. Further, reimbursement woes remain.Also, Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act. In December 2017, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association supported a lawsuit slapped on the acting secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The complaint filed against CMS (operating under the HHS purview), charged it with its failure to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

While a strong Spine market spells huge scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, pricing and payer pressure come as major headwinds.Notably, NuVasive exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a dismal note with its top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The U.S. business also delivered a dull performance with softness in both U.S. Spinal Hardware and U.S. Surgical Support businesses.On a positive note, the company’s solid international business registered more than 20% growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, buoying optimism on the stock among investors. Per management, the International region holds a tremendous growth opportunity for NuVasive.Also, NuVasive’s U.S. surgical support business has performed robustly in the recent times. This segment’s flourish is attributed to Biotronic, acquired in July 2016. With its integration still on track pertaining to a large-scale buyout, the company anticipates benefits of building an up-scale service business.Management believes that the addition of Biotronic to NuVasive’s profile has enhanced the company’s service offerings and is delivering a greater consolidation across its procedurally integrated portfolio.Currency volatility, reimbursement issues and a competitive landscape have been continuously posing challenges to the stock.

182,PKI,"QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report) announced that International Panel Physicians Association (“IPPA”) has endorsed QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) for immigrants’ medical screening. Per management, innumerable U.S. migrants suffer from latent and active tuberculosis (TB) every year. Consequently, the prudent usage of QIAGEN’s QFT-Plus will aid in curbing these challenges to public health in the coming quarters.Why Did IPPA Endorse QFT-Plus?Notably, IPPA is a not-for-profit physician education group working with countries receiving immigrants and refugees.Per the press release, IPPA called the modern class of TB tests known as interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) “essential to the safety and efficacy of screening programs designed for early detection of TB infection.”  Post the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) Division of Global Migration and Quarantine’s announcement of expanded TB testing requirements, the IPPA endorses the use of QFT-Plus for immigration medical screening. The CDC announcement of expanded TB testing requirements will be effective from Oct 1, 2018.Prior the announcement, guidelines for TB testing were limited to children (aged 2 to 14). Previously, the immigrants had the option to use either the TST or IGRA. However, the new guidelines require IGRA testing for immigrants (in all adults and children) applying for legal status in the United States. The TST method will no longer be accepted for immigration screening.Panel physicians (practicing abroad and appointed by receiving country governments to take care of the mandatory pre-departure medical examinations of migrants) will now be required to use IGRAs for TB screening. Notably, there are more than one-half million migrants per year receiving permanent lawful residence in the United States.QFT Unit at a GlanceBuilt on the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) platform, QFT-Plus provides enhanced analysis of TB infection. This advanced kit makes TB testing with innovative antigens possible as it measures the cell-mediated immune response from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We believe this approval will help QIAGEN expand its customer base and drive the uptake of QFT-Plus test, consequently boosting the top line.QFT-Plus is registered in more than 75 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. QFT-Plus is also endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of two IGRAs for its campaign to eradicate TB.The QuantiFERON-TB diagnostic test kit falls under QIAGEN’s Molecular Diagnostics segment, which was the highest revenue grosser in the last reported quarter. Notably, the segment contributed 49% to total revenues in the last reported quarter on substantial growth in QuantiFERON latent TB tests, QIAsymphony automation system consumables portfolio and solid performance of companion diagnostic pharma collaborations.Developments in QFTIn this regard, post the receipt of FDA approval in June 2017, QIAGEN had announced the complete launch of the fourth-generation blood test for TB infection — QFT-Plus — in the United States.Furthermore, continuing with the slew of developments, QIAGEN announced the signing of a collaboration agreement with DiaSorin in January 2017. Post collaboration, QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON-TB diagnostic test will be available under DiaSorin’s LIAISON portfolio of fully automated analyzers.QIAGEN recently announced the receipt of Japan’s Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare approval for QFT-Plus as an in vitro diagnostic to detect TB infection.Market ProspectsAccording to Research and Markets data published on Business Wire, the global TB diagnostics market is expected to see a CAGR of 4.5% between 2017 and 2025. Considering the bullish market sentiments, we believe that the latest development has arrived at an opportune moment.Share Price PerformanceQIAGEN has been gaining investor confidence on consistently encouraging results. Over the past six months, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 4.5%, in contrast to the industry’s 8.2% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

187,PKI,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has presented positive data from an at-home pediatric study on patients aged between seven and 13 years. Notably, the data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes’ 11th International Conference in Vienna, Austria.Study Results in DetailThe multi-center study had enrolled 105 participants within the 7-13 years’ age group. The trial consisted of a two-week run-in phase along with a study phase of three months. 97% of the participants chose to continue using the system as part of a Continued Access Program. Moreover, the study results demonstrated data from the pivotal trial of MiniMed 670G system on patients aged 14 years and above.Using the study results, the company has applied for an expanded FDA approval to include the patients ranging from seven to 13 years as eligible for using the MiniMed 670G system. At the same time, the company is working to expand the usage of the product on children aged between two and six years. Hopes are harbored on the effectiveness of this system, which should get greater customer adoptability over time.MiniMed 670G at a GlancePost the receipt of the FDA approval in 2016, Medtronic had commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017. It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older. The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic’s latest Guardian Sensor 3, a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance. This is the only FDA approved sensor to control a hybrid closed loop system including diagnostic technology that continuously checks sensor health. The system also carries Medtronic’s most advanced algorithm known as, SmartGuard HCL technology.Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed sluggish growth in Diabetes business last quarter. However, the company gained on a strong uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets. This growth was temporarily offset by a limited supply of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors. Moreover, a strong customer enrollment under the Priority Access Program briefly affected revenues.Per management, the diabetes business should witness revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as the company has finished shipping pumps for the Priority Access Program. Also, the company is moving steadily with its sensor capacity expansion plans, scheduled to be completed in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Additionally, Medtronic geared up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019. In this regard, the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on people with type 2 diabetes in October 2017.This apart, we are upbeat about Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) exit from the insulin pump business with Medtronic as partner to support a smooth transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Notably, patients using an Animas insulin pump will be offered the choice to switch to a Medtronic pump.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and a rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth in the diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the latest positive study results have come at an opportune moment.Share Price MovementMedtronic has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

Results demonstrated that in men who received the GPS test, active surveillance use was more than 30% higher than in men who did not receive the genomic test.  Per the press release, this publication also solidifies the evidence of GPS testing in the initial management of early prostate cancer and its ability to appropriately direct active surveillance use among low-risk patients.Developments in Prostate CancerGenomic Health recently announced a multi-year research collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Through this partnership, the companies will evaluate the responsiveness of Genomic Health’s Oncotype DX GPS test to Janssen’s prostate cancer drug pipeline.In November, Genomic Health announced an exclusive licensing agreement with biotechnology company, Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc.

189,PKI,"On Feb 5, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This leading molecular diagnostic company has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 20.2% in the past three months compared with 9.9% of the broader industry.IDEXX exited the fourth quarter on a solid note. Moreover, strong year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised guidance for 2018 earnings per share are encouraging.The stellar performance was driven by strong sales at the CAG business. In the fourth quarter, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on strong CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth and VetLab consumables organic revenue growth. We are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.  The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, strong top-line growth in the quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.We are also upbeat about the company witnessing double-digit organic revenue growth in the international business. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains supported by Catalyst instrument base and average testing utilization.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that allows it to carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues have been derived from sale of products in the international markets in 2017. Thus, the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact on revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. Also, the company’s high dependence on third-party distributors is a concern.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteSegmental DetailsHospital ProductsSales at the hospital products segment rose 3% at cc on a year-over-year basis to $1.7 billion. Hospital Products sales in the quarter were driven by solid sales in the U.S. fluid systems and select anesthesia and critical care products.Hospital Sales were also driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company’s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services.Renal ProductsSales in the segment increased 3% at cc to $1.1 billion. Renal products sales were supported by improved performance in all major product lines and therapies, globally. Notably, solid performance in chronic and acute renal therapies drove sales in the segment.Consistent Efforts to Increase ProductionPer management, the company’s Puerto Rico facilities, affected by the Hurricanes, are ramping up production. Additionally, Baxter has been working closely with FDA to support supply of certain products in the domestic market, which were cautioned for importation from Baxter’s facilities in Ireland, Australia, Canada, Mexico, England, Italy and Brazil.In the fourth quarter, Baxter launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa. oXIRIS, which leverages on the company’s flagship PRISMAFLEX system, is expected to lend the company a competitive edge in the global market.Recently, the company upgraded the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System with the launch of DeviceVue Advanced Asset Tracking System.

The company's impressive performance at the hospital products and renal segments hold promise. Recently, Baxter launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa. Further, the recent launch of DeviceVue, a comprehensive asset tracking solution available exclusively to hospitals, boosts the company’s product portfolio.On the flip side, foreign currency headwinds, intense competition and lackluster sales growth have been dampening Baxter’s performance since long.

During the quarter, Align Technology Invisalign cases were shipped to 44,985 doctors worldwide, of which 25,365 were to North America and 19,620 to international regions.Revenues from Scanner and Service (13.6%) improved a significant 37% to $57.1 million.MarginsGross margin in the quarter under review was up 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 75.5% in spite of a 41.8% rise in cost of net revenues.During the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 39.8% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $182.1 million and a 21.3% rise in research and development (R&D) expenses to $26.2 million.

Meanwhile, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 EPS is 90 cents on revenues of $395.9 million. Both the estimates are falling below the projected range.Our TakeAlign Technology ended the fourth quarter on a solid note. We are upbeat about the continued strength in Invisalign volumes. While GP dentists saw higher demand in North America following the summer holidays season, orthodontists witnessed increased adult patient footfall after a busy teen season in the preceding quarter. Internationally, we are encouraged by strength in the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed strong uptake of iTero scanners by GP dentists along with record contracts coming from the GP summit last September. Moreover, increased uptake due to the recent deal with Patterson Dental for Align’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system also contributed to the top-line. The company witnessed solid demand for the iTero scanners in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well.Align Technology has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchases and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward expansion of geographical presence and portfolio.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlign Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

203,PKI,"PerkinElmer, Inc.’s (PKI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, expected to release on Apr 30 after market close, are likely to show steady growth in the core Diagnostics business.

Meanwhile, revenues were approximately $641.6 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617 million.

QuoteLet’s dig deeper.Diagnostics Revenues in FocusDiagnostic revenues accounted for 30.1% of total revenues in the last quarter. Revenues in the segment rose to $193.4 million, up 23.3% from $193.4 million a year ago. This also reflects an improvement of 6% organically. The segment has been fortifying the company’s market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets.For the Diagnostics market, the company offers products that are used to detect genetic disorders. PerkinElmer also provides digital x-ray flat panel detectors and infectious disease testing solutions in its Diagnostics portfolio. The first-quarter results are likely to indicate strong growth in the Diagnostic revenues.In the last-reported quarter, operating profit margin for the segment, as a percentage of revenues, was 30.8%, up 20 basis points (bps) year over year.It is also encouraging to note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Diagnostics segment is at $235 million, up 21.5% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayEUROIMMUN Buyout: A PositiveThe divestment of medical imaging business and the acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG have been major drivers for the segment. PerkinElmer announced the completion of the EUROIMMUN buyout for approximately $1.3 billion in cash in December 2017. EUROIMMUN is an autoimmune testing company and an emerging player in the infectious disease and allergy testing space.Per management, the EUROIMMUN buyout has expanded PerkinElmer’s capabilities and helped it gain considerable traction. It has led to an increase in Diagnostics employees by more than 3000, strengthening the company’s R&D platform. The company is optimistic about increasing its R&D spending by 30% in 2018 from 2017 which is likely to account for 8.7% of product revenues.In the fourth quarter, EUROIMMUN contributed revenues of approximately $360 million, representing growth of 13-15%. It is also likely to add 100 bps to PerkinElmer’s organic growth.Discovery & Analytical Solutions (DAS)Revenues from DAS totaled $448.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3% from $409.9 million in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted earnings are expected at $3.50 a share. Further, it expects reported revenues in the range of $2.72-$2.74 billion, which includes approximately $25 million in foreign exchange tailwinds and around $360 million from EUROIMMUN.

204,PKI,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 23.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%. Overall, Waters Corp. outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWaters Corp.’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Particularly, Global pharmaceuticals business, which is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division in the past few quarters. We believe stable demand from pharmaceutical business, modest recovery of industrial markets as well as growth in recurring revenues will benefit the fourth-quarter results.Moreover, the company remains bullish on its Industrial business backed by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Additionally, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for its business and is likely to bolster the fourth-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, the company benefited largely from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. The company’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry grew impressively, driven by ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust traction of ACQUITY and CORTECS line of products along with strength in end markets are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.However, the fact remains that rising R&D expenses and high interest expenses remain a burden, consequently eroding profitability for the upcoming results. A significant portion of the company’s revenues is generated from non-U.S. markets. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe currency fluctuations to put pressure on top-line growth and margins for the quarter under review.Further, the company grapples with stiff competition from several international instrument manufacturers as well as other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. The company’s key technologies like HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines are part of a highly competitive industry and are subject to rapid changes in technology.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Waters Corp. this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of -0.32% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

However, we are upbeat about the company’s Animal Health segment that has been performing well lately. The company provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. The company’s broad spectrum of products cushions it against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.On the flip side, a downbeat guidance indicates looming concerns ahead.  Decreasing revenues in the dental segment is another headwind. The recent decline in the segment is driven by decreased sales of CEREC and digital technology products.

210,PKI,"On Mar 13, we issued an updated research report on The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Cooper Companies maintained its leading position in the specialty lens market, supported by exclusive products like Biofinity and Clariti. However, intense competition in the contact lens space will continue to build pressure on pricing.The company’s flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to see strong sales in the coming quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues increased on the back of silicone hydrogel lenses, led by the Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space.The company is also focusing on expanding geographically. The launch of MyDay Toric daily disposable contact lenses in the United States is in line with this. Management believes that the Toric market will grow faster than the overall market and the company can cash in on the opportunity with its strong portfolio and the recent addition of MyDay Toric. Moreover, Cooper Companies’ CooperVision segment is one of the key drivers. The segment gains from silicone hydrogel lenses, led by solid prospects in MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. We are encouraged to note that the Cooper Companies is progressing well with respect to inorganic expansion. In a bid to boost inorganic growth, Cooper Companies announced that CooperVision has completed the buyout of Paragon Vision Sciences in the fourth quarter of 2017.Shares of Cooper Companies have gained 21.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13.3%.On the flip side, Cooper Companies operates in a highly competitive market.

211,PKI,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently presented encouraging outcome from the U.S. Pivotal Extreme Risk Study and the real-world NOTION trial (Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention Trial) on the CoreValve TAVR system. The data was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s (""ACC"") 67th Annual Scientific Session.This development remains part of the company’s consistent effort to strengthen its position in the high-potential transcatheter aortic valve replacement (""TAVR"") market which is projected to reach around $6.5 billion by 2022 (data by Cision).Study Results in DetailThe NOTION trial enrolled around 280 patients, aging at least 70 years, and was subjected to surgical aortic valve replacement (""SAVR"") or TAVR with the CoreValve System. Notably, the studies evaluated patients at five years post-implant with the CoreValve TAVR system.The results demonstrated patients to experience an enhanced quality of lifealong with strong hemodynamic performance within five years. We believe, these results may boost the uptake of the CoreValve TAVR system.Developments in CoreValve TAVR PlatformThe CoreValve Evolut platform comprises CoreValve, CoreValve Evolut R and the CoreValve Evolut PRO system. Notably, in July 2017, Medtronic received FDA approval for the extended use of its self-expanding CoreValve Evolut TAVR system. With this approval, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and at an intermediate risk for open-heart surgery became eligible for treatment using the technology. Again, in March, CoreValve Evolut PRO system received FDA approval to be used on symptomatic patients who are at high or extreme risks for open heart surgery.Continuing with the slew of developments, last September, Medtronic announced initiating a post-market FORWARD PRO Clinical Study to measure the performance of CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve implantation (""TAVI"") system in regular clinical treatments.Thus, we believe, a clinical study data displaying the efficiency of the product will help the company gain traction in the Coronary & Structural Heart (""CSH"") space.Interestingly, Medtronic’s CSH third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues were up 18% (14% at constant exchange rate) to $886 million on the back of low constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves, as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval, to include patients at intermediate risk.Market ProspectsPer a report by Medgadget, the global heart valve repair and replacement market is expected to grow from $2,281.2 million in 2014 to $3,767.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.7%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in a high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%. Thus, the release of positive study data will help Medtronic cash in the abundant opportunities in the pancreatic cancer therapeutics market.Share Price MovementOver the past six months, the company’s share price has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.7% in comparison with the broader industry’s 8.8% gain. We believe that the latest development will help the stock rebound.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

213,PKI,"On Mar 12, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Shares of the company have outperformed the broader industry over the last three months. The stock has gained 18%, higher than the broader industry’s 2.3% rise.Illumina exited fourth-quarter 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, the metrics improved on a year-over-year basis. This apart, a progressing margin scenario instilled investor confidence in the stock. We are also optimistic about Illumina’s expansion strategy through enhancement of its portfolio of sequencing products and the development of strategic partnerships with therapeutic and diagnostic service providers. In this regard, Illumina signed a commercial agreement earlier this January 2018, for distributing Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Ion AmpliSeq technology to researchers conducting studies on its next-generation sequencing platform. The San Diego, CA-based Illumina is a tools and integrated systems provider for the analysis of genetic variation and function. The company focuses on product innovation via research and development, evident from its recent launch of iSeq 100 Sequencing System.Post a promising fourth quarter, we expect Illumina to maintain growth momentum on continued uptake of sequencing consumables, instruments and microarray portfolios.Meanwhile, the company faces stiff competition in the sequencing, SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several bigwigs already enjoying a significant market share, intellectual property portfolios as well as regulatory expertise.

214,PKI,"Accuray Incorporated (ARAY  -  Free Report) gains from strong demand for Radixact platform. Solid growth in European and APAC regions also holds promise. Lately, contributions in order performance from the EMEA and Japan regions have also been solid. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Radixact is one of the company’s latest devices, which contributed to revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 results. The Radixact system comprised 70% of all TomoTherapy orders. More than 25 Radixact units have been recognized since the product launch.Further, the system is being accepted as a true workhorse product in the market, courtesy of its significantly improved product performance, functional efficacies and broad case mix versatility.Growing adoption of non-surgical treatment options, successful execution of restructuring plans and accretive acquisitions are other positives.Recently, Accuray announced the launch of its precision treatment planning system. The system leverages on the company’s flagship Radixact and CyberKnife system platforms. The company plans to build on this technology with Precision 2.0 upgrade by fiscal 2018. This will significantly improve treatment speed and overall throughput of the existing CyberKnife system.Accuray also announced 510(k) clearance for the new IBMS data management system for TomoTherapy.

Meanwhile, the company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on an impressive note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. A strong guidance for fiscal 2018 instills confidence in investors.BD has been banking on solid segmental growth of late. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the BD Medical segment generated revenues of $2.04 billion, up 1.9% at constant currency (cc) on a year-over-year basis. The BD Life Sciences segment generated revenues of $1.05 billion, up 7.3% at cc from the year-ago quarter. As a result, the company reported net revenues of $3.08 billion, up 5.4% from the prior-year quarter or 3.7% at cc.Strategic acquisitions have also been a key catalyst for BD. Recently, the company acquired C.R. Bard. Per management, BD is on its way to become one of the biggest medical-technology devices company in the world with approximately $16 billion in annualized revenues.Including the accretion from C. R. Bard acquisition, BD expects fiscal 2018 revenues to increase to the range of 30-31% on a reported basis. However, revenues are expected to grow in the range of 4.5-5.5% at cc. Notably, revenues are likely to be affected by the change in the U.S. dispensing business model.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.85-$11.00, up from the previous range of $10.55-$10.65. The current range indicates growth of approximately 15-16% on a reported basis or approximately 12% at cc.BD’s collaborative move with Fresenius Medical Care (FMS  -  Free Report) to provide sodium chloride saline to customers is also noteworthy. BD enjoys a strong presence in the instrument market and the buyout will boost its competitive position in the sequencing market. The company is expected to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that will boost long-term growth prospects.BD announced an agreement with Italy-based Euroclone for the development and global distribution of molecular assays.

217,PKI,"On Feb 9, we issued an updated research report on Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The renowned home health and hospice services provider has been trading above the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has rallied 14.8% against the broader industry’s 1% decline.Of late, the company has made a number of strategic acquisitions, the recent being Tenet Healthcare’s home health and hospice operations in Arizona, for a deal value of $20.5 million. Amedisys claims this buyout to be a strategic fit as it is likely to help the company provide high-quality post-acute services in the key markets. This consolidation might allow Amedisys to improve the delivery of care and patient management across the care continuum in these markets. Amedisys’ Personal Care segment has been growing strong and stable on the latest integrated tuck-in acquisitions. Moreover, the company is upbeat about bountiful prospects in this segment. In October 2017, Amedisys announced that its subsidiary, Associated Home Care, completed the buyout of Intercity Home Care, a personal care provider headquartered in Malden, MA.Also, a favorable 2018 Home Health Final Rule buoys optimism. Per a report by HEALTHCAREfirst, the rule was finalized without implementing the Home Health Groupings Model scheduled for rollout in 2019.Meanwhile, Amedisys is poised to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and the need for higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flip side, escalating operating expenses and declining gross margin continue to raise concerns. Also, an intensely competitive landscape and regulatory concerns weigh on the home health and hospice industry.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).PerkinElmer has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.3%.

218,PKI,"On Mar 12, we issued an updated research report on ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), a leading medical product developer. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company's robust demand for the Impella product line has been the key growth catalyst. However, stiff competition adds to the woes.Impella, ABIOMED’s flagship product line, has continued to be growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump.

The current level is also better than the industry's growth of  27.6%. Competition among treatment providers for heart-related diseases is intense and is subject to rapid technological change, and evolving industry requirements and standards. ABIOMED’s products compete with a temporary cardiac assist device from Throated, which was acquired by St. Jude. The company also faces stiff competition from organizations developing permanent heart assist products.Of the other major headwinds, ABIOMED is likely to face increasing pricing pressure due to growing competitionin its key markets.

The stock has rallied 61.5% compared with the industry’s 3.5% gain. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500’s 7.4% gain.Haemonetics exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 on a promising note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Continued momentum in new business generation and geographical expansion has helped the company deliver strong results in the quarter. The expansion in gross and operating margin buoys optimism.  We are upbeat about Haemonetics’ growth in the Plasma franchise. Strong end-market demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals continues to drive growth. Haemonetics is also confident about maintaining growth in the commercial Plasma collection business.Further, the raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is encouraging. The company’s strong cash position also boosts investors’ confidence.On the flip side, Haemonetics operates in a very competitive environment, for manual and automated systems, which includes the likes of MAK Systems.Moreover, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise, significantly affecting its results over the past few quarters.

221,PKI,"Healthcare diagnostic majors and arch-rivals Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp are on the same page regarding the much contentious topic of Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) on clinical lab fee schedule. Recently, both the companies as members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) have come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The lawsuit charged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under the purview of HHS, have failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Per the lawsuit claims, CMS ignored the Congress directives stated under PAMA and instituted a highly flawed data reporting process of setting market rates in advance.This prohibited the overwhelming majority of laboratories from reporting the private payer data used to determine Medicare rates for lab tests. The move has instead resulted in new Medicare lab rates, which are not market-specific. Hence, the entire process clearly demonstrates CMS’ failure to protect access to laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries.Per the press release from LabCorp, if the new rates are allowed to come into effect, it will affect the Medicare beneficiaries as well as disrupt the healthcare system. Per Quest diagnostics, “this flawed process could cause serious financial harm to potentially thousands of hospitals, independent and physician office laboratories and make it harder for Medicare beneficiaries to get access to medical testing, particularly in remote rural areas and in nursing homes that depend on laboratory testing services”. Earlier during the third quarter earnings release, both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics had issued certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by CMS on the proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by PAMA. Per the companies, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prevented from reporting their rates.The above-mentioned 1% of laboratories majorly denoted independent labs. To convey the severity of the situation in clear terms, Quest Diagnostics stated that based on data submitted through CMS, the company alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data that CMS collected.Among other possibly badly hit clinical laboratories, thanks to the latest CMS mandate on clinical lab fee schedule, two names emerge as DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). While Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp and PerkinElmer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), DaVita has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PerkinElmer’s third-quarter earnings stands at 73 cents per share, signifying year-over-year growth of 6.8%. For revenues, the consensus estimate stands at $552.4 million, up 8% year over year.For the third quarter of 2017, PerkinElmer projects revenues in the range of $550 million to $555 million, which represents organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. Third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of 71 cents to 73 cents.Solid Global Foothold: PerkinElmer has been developing biochemical and molecular testing menu to meet the needs of pharmaceutical companies and serve the markets of China and India. In the last quarter, the company won two newborn-screening tenders in Russia and Mexico. Added to this, strong demand from the China Laboratory business launched last year is expected to yield solid results in the quarter to be reported.PerkinElmer also acquired Goa, India-based Tulip Diagnostics Private Ltd for an undisclosed amount. Although Tulip was acquired in early January, we are bullish about the buyout as it will help PerkinElmer tap into the opportunities in the emerging market of diagnostics. The takeover is also likely to strengthen PerkinElmer’s foothold in the infectious disease testing space.Foreign Exchange Volatility: Increasing exposure to the international market increases the risk of foreign exchange volatility. Foreign exchange posed a headwind of approximately 1% to the top line in the last quarter. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales. Due to the sluggish European economy, revenues and earnings are likely to be affected adversely this season.Our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for PerkinElmer this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for PerkinElmer is -0.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.INC Research Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.

224,PKI,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 11 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke with in-line earnings in one of the quarters last year. In second-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive streak, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 by 2.3%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.58. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Asia, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 4% year over year to $558 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.9 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 7% on a constant currency basis) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 4% on a constant currency basis). The momentum was further aided by growth of 5% (on a constant currency basis) in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales grew 5% and 3%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 14% and 5% growth, respectively, at constant currency. However, sales in the Americas continued to reflect weakness and declined 3% year over year.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $130.2 million, up from $129.6 million incurred in second-quarter 2016. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $32.9 million compared with $32.6 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter climbed 1.4% year over year to $118.9 million.Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteLiquidityWaters Corp.’s cash, cash equivalents and investments at the quarter end amounted to just over $3 billion, higher than the $2.81 billion recorded as on Dec 31, 2016. The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.48 billion from $2.36 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a strong revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business started 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum, going ahead. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business, moving ahead.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other similarly-ranked stocks in the same space include Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report), Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. (MTD  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report).

226,PKI,"On Mar 5, we issued an updated research report on Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report). The company has been witnessing strength in the Veterinary business based on encouraging consumable segment’s growth. However, rising expenses along with a bleak gross and operating margin scenario have been raising concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This manufacturer of portable Medical (human) and Veterinary (animal) blood analysis systems, providing clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements in medical and veterinarian markets globally, has outperformed its industry in the past three months. The stock has gained 44.2% compared with the industry’s 4.1%.We are upbeat about Abaxis’ double-digit consumable growth within the Veterinary business. Within the consumable product lines, total rotor revenues grew double-digits. This apart, other veterinary consumable, which includes hematology reagents, rapid assays, i-STAT cartridges, coagulation cartridges and urine analysis strips drove veterinary consumable revenues.  Moreover, Abaxis has been emphasizing on product innovation through research and development. In this regard, in January, the company received approval from USDA, Center for Veterinary Biologics, for VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test.Solid global sales of Piccolo instruments are encouraging. Per management, as healthcare delivery consolidates across the United States into these groups, networks and healthcare conglomerates, Abaxis’ Piccolo is positioned to capture the lion’s share of the diagnostic tests market.Meanwhile, escalating operating expenses have been exerting pressure on the bottom line. Moreover, Abaxis faces intense competition in both the Medical and Veterinary markets. In this regard, the company competes against firms that have substantially greater resources on all fronts — financial, research and development (R&D) plus operations and marketing. Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

227,PKI,"On Mar 3, we issued an updated research report on Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Integra LifeSciences exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a solid note. The strong year-over-year increase in revenues on the back of the company’s recently acquired business — Johnson & Johnson Codman Neurosurgery business and Derma Sciences —buoys optimism. However, a tough competitive landscape adds to the company’s woes.Over the past year, Integra LifeSciences has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 25.9%, compared with 2.7% decline of the industry.Coming to the quarterly results, Integra LifeSciences saw 2.3% organic growth in the Codman Specialty Surgical (CSS) segment in fourth-quarter. Reported revenues in the quarter grew 46.2% on the back of revenues from Codman Neurosurgery. This can be attributed to the sequential double-digit growth registered by Tissue ablation business owing to strong capital sales of the newly-launched CUSA Clarity. This apart, Dural Repair business performed well with 5% year-over-year organic growth on strength in DuraGen and DuraSeal product lines.  We are also encouraged to note that the segments saw year-over-year revenue growth in the period. Nonetheless, we believe the company is trying to execute its growth plan through an efficient management team. Moreover, the rise in year-over-year investments in research and development is encouraging. Also, the company’s promising guidance instills investor confidence in the stock.However, Integra LifeSciences faces intense competition in the surgical implants and medical instruments market. The company needs to be innovative on the product front to fend off competition. Moreover, consolidation in the industry could lead to intense pricing pressure.Also, significant margin contractions caused by escalating costs and expenses raise concerns.Further, the company generates significant revenues from the international business, which increases its vulnerability to adverse currency movements.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and athenahealth, Inc.

(QGEN  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of Japan’s Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare approval for QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) as an in vitro diagnostic to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection. Notably, built on the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) platform, QFT-Plus provides enhanced analysis of TB infection. This advanced kit makes TB testing with innovative antigens possible as it measures the cell-mediated immune response from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We believe this approval will help QIAGEN expand its customer base and drive the uptake of QFT-Plus test, thereby boosting the top line.QuantiFERON-TB Diagnostic Test DevelopmentsThe QuantiFERON-TB diagnostic test kit falls under QIAGEN’s Molecular Diagnostics segment, which was the highest revenue grosser in the last reported quarter.

Moreover, per the agreement, the companies will be working on developing a completely automated version of the QuantiFERON test read-out components for use with the QuantiFERON-TB Plus test along with future QuantiFERON-based tests that will be adopted for use on LIAISON.In this regard, the companies plan to launch the CE-marked QuantiFERON read out components for use on LIAISON XL in the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, a 2019 launch in the United States along with a 2020 launch in China are planned for the same.Market ProspectsQIAGEN has been witnessing substantial demand for theQuantiFERON-TB diagnostic test kit.

234,PKI,"On Feb 12, we issued an updated research report on Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This medical device manufacturer, developer and marketer of innovative solutions to treat patients with peripheral and coronary arterial diseases, including those with arterial calcium, saw a solid second quarter of fiscal 2018. The company witnessed year-over-year rise in revenues at both coronary arterial disease (CAD) and coronary arterial disease (PAD) businesses. Also, the expansion in gross margin was impressive.Cardiovascular Systems has been expanding its product portfolio to enhance market reach. Currently, Cardiovascular Systems is pursuing product improvement and evaluating new technologies to strengthen and broaden its portfolio of powerful micro invasive tools. Earlier, the company had received FDA approval for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown system to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD. The company also won approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown and launched it commercially in February. Also, the company received FDA approval for radial access Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Device to treat PAD. We are upbeat about Cardiovascular Systems’ two new partnerships, which have broadened its portfolio. The company is now the U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. OrbusNeich PCI balloons include the Sapphire II Pro, which is scheduled to get FDA approval this year for the 1.0 mm coronary balloon. Moreover, the company has signed an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation for CSI-branded ZILIENT guidewires.We are also optimistic about the favorable trends in the PAD as well as CAD spaces. Per the American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer from PAD. Moreover, an aging population coupled with rising incidence of diabetes and obesity is likely to increase the occurrence of PAD. This offers a huge scope for the unique PAD Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) of Cardiovascular Systems.Over the past three months, Cardiovascular Systems has been underperforming the  industry. The stock has declined 7.8% against the industry’s 1.9% rise.  Furthermore, the company faces cutthroat competition in the niche space. Its OAS products compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Larger competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include bigwigs like Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report). Moreover, on the profitability front, Cardiovascular Systems has a long history of net losses since its inception in 1989, with no immediate recovery in sight. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings for 2018 is currently pinned at 77 cents per share.                             Bottom LineAllscripts’ solid outlook for 2018 instills investor optimism. Further, the recently-completed acquisition of Practice Fusion, a cloud-based electronic health record, aimed primarily at small, independent physician practices, is likely to drive the company’s inorganic growth. This transaction gave Allscripts the largest US market share in outpatient settings.Further, the company has entered into an agreement to divest its One Content business to Hyland Software.The company’s solid growth in U.S. Core Solutions and Services holds promise at the moment. Allscripts Sunrise electronic health record platform and Revenue Cycle Management Services are likely to drive the company’s top line in the quarters to come.However, the company’s continued reliance on mergers and acquisition activities poses substantial integration risks. Intensifying competition is a major dampener. The company’s products have a long sales-cycle, which involves intensive decision-making at different managerial levels. Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses to support business growth over the long haul.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllscripts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

246,PKI,"On Feb 20, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company exited the second quarter on a solid note, courtesy of encouraging performance by the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment also witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 17.4%, comparing unfavorably with the industry's gain of around 9.9%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues. However, the company’s share price has been rising since the second-quarter earnings release. The stock has gained 4.1% till yesterday’s close.Cardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings lend the company a competitive edge in the niche space. The company offers industry expertise and an expanding portfolio of safe products. Also, Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and continues to focus on investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and boost profits. Cardinal Health recently announced the acquisition of Medtronic's (MDT  -  Free Report) Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency business for $6.1 billion. The buyout particularly boosted the company’s Medical segment.Further,Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term strategic agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive core sales and prove accretive to Cardinal Health’s earnings in the long term.Despite growth in business, profits at the company’s Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiency in the upcoming quarter. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.Other Key PicksA couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.The stent has been exclusively designed to help interventional cardiologists treat patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). These patients have small vessels and are often untreatable with larger stent technologies during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Management believes the introduction of Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES enables doctors to broaden treatment options for patients with smaller vessels.

Quote Notably, the company announced preliminary results on Jan 8.      In the quarter, the company witnessed robust performance in the international market. However, the upside was marred by a decline in U.S. revenues. Notably, pressure in the biologics business, softness in procedural volumes in the U.S. spine market followed by difficult comparisons to the year-ago figure led to the disappointing performance in the United States. However, management is satisfied with the key volume growth in the core hardware business.Notably, the company faced a $1.5-million headwind in the international business after the hurricanes hit Puerto Rico in 2017. In the reported quarter, the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business declined around 4%. However, revenues in this business were flat, after adjusting the year-ago figure for MAGEC sales of $4.8 million. Notably, rise in pricing pressure and product mix had offset case volume growth of around 5%.Revenues from U.S. Surgical Support business declined around 10% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to weakness in the biologics portfolio along with persistent sluggishness in the U.S. service business case volume growth.However, the international business recorded 34% growth at CER or 35% on a reported basis for the fifth consecutive time on solid contributions from key geographies.In the reported quarter, there was a 12.7% increase in cost of goods sold after excluding amortization of intangible assets expenses.

The guidance has been adjusted for the recent buyout of SafePassage, full-year benefit of U.S. tax reform and suspension of the medical device tax.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.105 billion, reflecting 4.4% to 5.4% organic growth. Moreover, on a reported basis, the company expects revenue growth in the range of 6.4% to 7.3%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 billion lags the guided range.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 lags the guided range. Additionally, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected at 17.6%, up 100 bps on a year-over-year basis.Our TakeNuVasive exited the fourth quarter on an unfavorable note, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues. Moreover, the company saw softness in both its businesses. However, solid performance of the international business with more than 20% growth for the fifth consecutive quarter buoys optimism.The company’s expectation to higher adjusted operating profit margin of at least 100 bps in 2018 shows its focus on operational efficiencies and in-house manufacturing facility. Moreover, we are upbeat about the recently-completed buyout of SafePassage. Per NuVasive, the acquisition will strengthen the company's intraoperative neuromonitoring business line. The consolidated giant is expected to deliver services to more than 1,000 customers and 3,000 surgeons.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

252,PKI,"On Feb 26, we issued an updated research report on PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include increased focus on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while also expanding the product line.After several quarters of a drag in new order sales, we are impressed with PetMed’s improved performance last fiscal. The current year has demonstrated bullish momentum so far. PetMed is also working on improving the effectiveness of its campaigns. It has been quite successful in driving its sales via the Internet.PetMed offers a wide range of products for dogs, cats and horses. We believe with the improvement in economic conditions, PetMed’s wide range of products will help drive growth in the coming quarters.  However, with an aim to increase the recognition of its brand names, PetMed markets its products through national advertising campaigns. Under this procedure, the company has been incurring huge expenses related to advertising campaigns in recent times. Hence, escalating advertising expenses exert pressure on the bottom line. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a major concern.Stock Performance & Estimate RevisionOver the last year, PetMed has outperformed its industry. The company has gained 123.9% compared with 65.9% of the industry.Also, the estimate revision trend for the current year is favorable with one estimate moving north over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction.

Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.8% is a positive for BD. Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects over the long haul.Here we take a look at five other factors that are likely to provide BD with a competitive edge in MedTech in the quarters to come.5 Factors Worth ConsideringShare Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that shares have returned 22.2%, which compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 6.7%. The current return is also greater than the industry’s gain of 11.6%.The price surge can be attributed to strong investor optimism around the stock, considering that BD’s scale, size, commercial platform, industry-leading brands and solid acquisition strategies are likely to drive growth.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Recently, the company established a third business segment — BD Interventional. Notably, the recently-acquired C.R. Bard is integrated in this vertical. In this regard, management confirmed that BD is on track to become one of the biggest medical-technology devices company in the world following the buyout.The acquisition is expected to generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion. This will also boost the company’s share price in the upcoming days.Launches: Recently, BD announced the commercial availability of the CE-IVD marked PAXgene Blood circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) tube within the European Economic Area and Switzerland (Western Europe).The plastic tube, used for blood collection, was developed by PreAnalytiX GmbH, a joint venture between BD and Netherlands-based provider of Sample to Insight solutions, QIAGEN N.V.

R. Bard acquisition, BD expects fiscal 2018 revenues to increase in the range of 30-31% on a reported basis.

The current range indicates growth of approximately 15-16% on a reported basis, or approximately 12% at cc.Geographical Expansion: BD continues to focus on geographical expansion into overseas markets, in particular, emerging markets.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, international revenues grew 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by Kiestra installations and strength in core microbiology within Diagnostic Systems as well as strong sales of clinical instruments within the Biosciences unit.Strength in pre-filled flush devices in MPS and strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems also contributed to international growth.Developed markets revenues grew 2.5% in the first quarter, including an anticipated headwind from the U.S. dispensing change of 130 basis points (bps). Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe in Pharmaceutical Systems and Diagnostic Systems.The combination of BD and Bard augments the company’s growth profile in developed markets. For fiscal 2018, BD estimates developed market growth of around 4% on a reported basis.On an adjusted basis, the markets are expected to grow 4.5% year over year, excluding the estimated 50-bps impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane in Puerto Rico.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2.

255,PKI,"Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a 44% surge year over year. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. The metric was favourably attributed by 10 cents of lower tax rate and 4 cents of currency translation, partly offset by a couple of cents’ dilution on increased share count.On a reported basis, Haemonetics posted net loss of 12 cents per share compared with earnings of 30 cents in the prior-year quarter. The metric included $12 million of net transition tax on earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, previously tax deferred. However, the same is partly offset by a $7-million benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax items using the lower corporate tax rates effective Jan 1, 2018.Total RevenuesRevenues were up 2.7% year over year (up 1.1% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $234 million in the reported quarter. The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $227 million.

Adjusted operating margin expanded 270 bps year over year to 17.9% in the quarter under review. Favourable foreign currency translation contributed about 100 basis points to year-over-year operating margin improvement.Financial PositionHaemonetics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $252 million compared with $203.6 million at the end of the preceding year. The company generated operating cash flow of $163 million year to date. Adjusted free cash flow (before transformation and restructuring costs) was $113.4 million this quarter, a 33% increase from the year-ago period.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceHaemonetics revised its fiscal 2018 revenue guidance. The company expects full-year revenues to be in line with fiscal 2017 revenues (excludes currency impact of over 50 bps). The view for Plasma revenue growth has been raised to 5% from the 3-5% range, projected earlier. The outlook for hospital revenue rise has been updated to 6% from the earlier expectation of 7-10%. Blood Center revenues are likely to decline in the 6-7% range (the previous guidance was a decrease of 7-10%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $892.1 million.The company raised its 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.80-$1.90 from the previous band of $1.65-$1.75. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 remains below the guided range.Our TakeHaemonetics exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 on a promising note with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Continued momentum in new business generation and geographical expansions have helped the company deliver strong results of late. However, we are disappointed with the company’s sluggish Blood Center business moderating its overall growth this reporting cycle despite encouraging progress noticed in the Plasma and Hospitals.The company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence. The increased fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is also impressive.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHaemonetics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The figure however outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $189 million and was above the company’s guidance of $187-$189 million.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc.

However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is disappointing. On a positive note, the company observed strong growth in both GeneSight and EndoPredict testing revenues. The recent FDA approvals and encouraging test results buoy optimism.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat.

However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 billion by a close margin.The year-over-year rise in net revenues was owing to 10% growth from acquisitions, organic growth (net revenue growth minus revenues from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.6% and a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from foreign currency translation.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Net revenues for the year 2017 were $10.21 billion, up 8.2% over the preceding year’s number. The metric is also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.19 billion by 0.2%.Quarter Under ReviewLabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenues of $1.82 billion, up 8.6% year over year, fueled by tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the completion of each acquisition) and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points. The company reported a 6.6% rise in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 1.8% increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported a 23.8% rise in net revenues to $886.1 million in the fourth quarter. This upside was primarily on the back of Chiltern buyout, organic growth and the foreign currency translation benefit of nearly 140 basis points.Gross margin deteriorated 92 bps to 30.4% in the reported quarter. Adjusted operating income declined 3.6% year over year to $328.6 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 212 bps from the year-ago quarter to 12.2% on a 21.1% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $492.4 million.LabCorp exited the year 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $316.7 million compared with $433.6 million at the end of 2016.

During the quarter under discussion, the company returned $40 million to shareholders via share repurchases and has shares worth $407.4 million, remaining under its existing authorized share repurchase plan.OutlookLabCorp has provided its 2018 guidance.Revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 9.5-11.5% from 2017 including a likely improvement of 60 bps from a foreign currency translation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.06 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 has been projected in the range of $11.30-$11.70. The consensus mark of $10.67 for the metric falls below the guided range.Free cash flow has been anticipated within $1.1-$1.2 billion, growth in the band of 0-9.1% from the prior year.Our TakeLabCorp posted a mixed fourth-quarter performance with adjusted earnings topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate and net revenues falling short of the mark. On a positive note, strong year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenues were encouraging. LabCorp Diagnostics business was solid on the back of increasing acquisitions, organic volume expansion and a favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also, after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development has been reporting sturdy growth over the past couple of terms. This uptrend was primarily owing to the Chiltern takeover, robust organic growth and a positive foreign currency translation. The 2018 guidance also looks promising.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, for $815 million in cash. The deal was initiated in November 2017.  The acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2018. Further, the deal is expected to return 15 cents to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2020. It is expected to strengthen the company’s support to community pharmacy and drive long-term, durable value.Our TakeAmerisourceBergen ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. A strong guidance instills investor’s optimism on the stock. Strong performance in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business holds promise. The recent takeover of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, is a positive.On the flip side, AmerisourceBergen faces headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company’s bottom line. Cutthroat competition in niche space adds to the company’s woes.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks that reported impressive earnings this season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

259,PKI,"On Feb 6, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. The stock has been trading above the broader industry over the past six months. As per the latest share price, it has lost 2.1% compared with 3.9% decline of the broader industry.The company ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, QIAGEN’s Molecular diagnostics sales increased significantly on dynamic growth in the QuantiFERON latent TB test. Also, double-digit CER growth in revenues from the company’s companion diagnostics partnerships and sustained double-digit CER growth in consumables related to the QIAsymphony automation system contributed to the top line.Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company surpassed its goal of 2,000 QIAsymphony placements in 2017, reflecting strong demand for the system. Management now aims to surpass 2,300 cumulative QIAsymphony placements by the end of 2018. Also, the company’s focus to drive growth through Sample-to-Insight offerings buoys optimism.  We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s solid progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In this regard, in January, the company’s ipsogen JAK2 RGQ PCR Kit (ipsogen JAK2 assay) received FDA approval for additional use in the diagnosis of all myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing intensifying competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive, which adds to the concerns. Also, strong reliance on collaborations and declining HPV sales in the United States are other negatives.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 5 cents.Revenues in the quarter fell 4.2% to $17 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18 million.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Segment AnalysisSurmodics reports revenues under two segments — Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD).Medical DeviceIn the reported quarter, sales declined 7.2% to $12.8 million due to lower hydrophilic royalty revenues. Royalty and license fee revenues totaled $7.1 million, down $0.9 million year over year.Per management, the decline in royalty and license fee revenues was caused by lower royalties resulting from expirations of patents in the third-generation hydrophilic coatings.This unit generated a $0.4-million operating loss in the reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with operating income of $3.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the segment was affected by planned increased investments related to Surmodics’ whole product solution strategy, reductions in royalty revenues as well as a $0.7-million increase in contingent consideration expense.IVDIn the quarter under review, sales increased 5.9% to $4.2 million. The upside came on the back of strong growth and stabilization across BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales.IVD operating income was $1.7 million in the current quarter compared with $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Surmodics, Inc.

Quote Margin DetailsProduct gross margins contracted 160 basis points (bps) in the first quarter to 64.3% of product sales compared with 65.9% in the year-ago period. Margins in the quarter suffered from expenses in the Irish facility infrastructure and lower Medical-Device product gross margins.First quarter of fiscal 2018 R&D expenses were 46% of net sales, higher than 33.6% of net sales in the year-ago quarter. The company anticipates R&D expense to increase in fiscal 2018, thanks to the company’s whole product solution strategy investments, advancing the TRANSCEND drug coater balloon human clinical trial, preclinical work on below-the-knee platform and AV fistula drug-coated balloon projects.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were 30.5% of revenues, expanding 310 bps year over year.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAt the end of the first quarter, the company had $46.7 million in cash and investments.

The segment has been gaining grounds on the back of strong growth and stabilization across BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales. Surmodics issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2018. The company's solid initiatives to strengthen research and development programs hold promise.The company witnessed significantly high operating losses, specifically in Ireland. Product sales declined substantially owing to shipment issues, particularly in the Medical Device segment. Further, foreign-exchange woes related to the Creagh Medical buyout have been a major dampener. Surmodics’ drug-coated balloons face stiff competition in niche space. The company’s margins are expected to be under pressure, thanks to expenses in the Irish facility infrastructure and lower Medical-Device product gross margins.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $183.88 billion.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and continued price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.2% to 389.7 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 69 million, up 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC were up by a marginal 0.3% year over year to $20.9 billion. According to the company, a 2.5% increase in same store prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 0.7% year over year but were positively impacted 80 basis points by seasonal cough and cold. Front-store sales were adversely affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales increased 0.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were adversely affected by approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the reported quarter.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 80 bps to 86.9% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around 160 bps to 86.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit improved 3.9% to $7.9 billion. However, gross margin contracted 21 bps to 16.3%.

Full-year, net cash provided by operating activities was $8 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.During the fourth quarter, CVS Health opened 65 new retail stores and closed 13 and relocated five retail locations. As of Dec 31, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,803 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.OutlookThe company has revised its outlook for 2018. The revision reflects the effects of the tax reform achieved through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Management noted that, with $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the TCJA, the company will be able to make strategic investments in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term.Accordingly, the company has increased its 2018 adjusted operating profit growth guidance to a range of 1% to 4% from the earlier-stated range of (1.5%) to 1.5%.Earlier, while providing its 2018 initial outlook, CVS Health noted that, it expects to deliver net revenue growth of 0.75% to 2.5% in the year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full-year revenues is pegged at $188.04 billion.For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%.Our TakeCVS Health ended the year 2017 on a solid note with a better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance. The year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services.

Internationally, the company had signed a contract with HCL HCA healthcare for both pharmacy and supply solutions for six hospitals in the U.K. The third leg of acquisition and partnerships is also progressing successfully. The company's most recent buyout is InPharmics, a Mississippi-based technology and services company which should help Omnicell in expanding the capabilities of its Performance Center.Omnicell’s strong position in Sweden, Germany, U.K., Singapore, Middle East, South Africa and China also buoys optimism. The company has been witnessing strong pipeline development in these countries. In addition, Omnicell witnessed strong business trends across Europe where it has observed a healthy acceptance of its medication adherence products.Meanwhile, we would like to remain on the sidelines as over the past month, Omnicell has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 16.1% versus the industry’s 6.5% fall.  Moreover, Omnicell continues to expect higher costs in the upcoming quarters stemming from the integration of Aesynt and Ateb and expenses related to the recently launched XT series, thereby adding to the concern.   Moreover, Omnicell is exposed to a resilient hospital capital expenditure environment that might adversely affect the adoption of its solutions. Furthermore, the reimbursement mix has also affected the endowments income, further affecting hospital spending capabilities. While the company has won some new deals in larger hospitals, the market is still susceptible to the economy and credit conditions.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusted EPS surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. According to the company, the year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a higher gross profit ratio, reduced interest expenses and a lower effective income tax rate.        Reported EPS of 17 cents was down 50% from the year-ago quarter on lower net income majorly due to a $8.3-million rise in income tax expenses.Net SalesIn the reported quarter, net sales totaled $205.9 million, up 7.5% year over year.

Moreover, favorable product mix contributed to overall revenue growth at the segment.Net sales at the Performance Products segment increased 19% to $13.4 million on higher average selling prices and volumes of copper-based products.

271,PKI,"On Feb 26, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into adjacent markets and strengthen core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, which is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction, and surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services has outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has gained 31.5% compared with the industry’s 16.5% rally.STERIS exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. We are encouraged by the favorable underlying market trends along with the new product and service offerings. The company’s organic growth was strong across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments.We are particularly upbeat about STERIS’ six acquisitions in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Through these buyouts, the company aims to strengthen the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. Furthermore, financed with both cash on hand and credit facility borrowings, the company had to incur acquisition cost of around $51.6 million, net of cash acquired and including potential contingent consideration of $5.3 million.We believe STERIS can pursue back-to-back acquisitions in the long run in order to expand business and customer base, courtesy of its strong financial position.We are also encouraged by the company’s recent organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. We also expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies that have extensive product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company expects to face intense competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, a number of STERIS’ customers are undergoing consolidation, partly due to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressure as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We believe if the company fails to check the rate of its customer consolidation now, it will adversely affect its business as well as financial condition.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

272,PKI,"Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report) recently announced the commercial launch of Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown (Micro Crown) in Japan, following the country’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) approval in March 2017.The device has been approved for frontline treatment of severe calcified lesions and for facilitating access to arteries for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) thereafter. Interestingly, the approval was given following presentation of favorable 1-year data from its Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System Study (COAST).The company noted that, with over 280,000 PCIs per year, of which 10-20% are projected to be extremely calcified, the Japan market for coronary interventions holds huge potential.

In 2017, the company received FDA approval for the Micro Crown system to facilitate stent delivery in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).Market PotentialThe global market for coronary heart diseases is expected to see huge demand on the back of growing cases of chronic diseases. Moreover, going by a report published by Technavio, the global market for coronary heart diseases is expected to see a CAGR of more than 5% between 2017 and 2021.

We believe applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ are fortifying its market position in terms of exclusiveness of services provided in the respective markets. A strong client base has been a key catalyst.Business and Services revenues witnessed year-over-year growth while the same in the implementation and other segment declined. Among major concerns, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others. Further, athenahealth fell short of its bookings goals in 2017. Deteriorated client retention rates also add to the company’s woes.Other Key PicksA few top-ranked stocks that reported impressive earnings this season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

274,PKI,"On Jan 31, we issued an updated research report on Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (HRC  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This Batesville, IN-based company has been trading above the broader industry in the past year. The stock has so far gained 46.9% in comparison with the industry's 26.8%. Hill-Rom exited the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company saw a solid year-over-year increase in revenues on strong international growth, primarily banking on the 'One Hill-Rom' approach.The company is focusing on product innovation, the latest launch being Connex Cardio ECG. Hill-Rom has updated its 2020 long-range financial objectives and outlook considering gains from the new tax reform. Hill-Rom now expects adjusted earnings growth of 12-14% on a compound annual basis through 2020, compared with the previous guidance of 10-12%. Moreover, an improvement in gross and adjusted operating margin buoys optimism. Further, according to management, Hill-Rom expects the latest U.S. tax regulations to have a positive impact on its adjusted effective tax rate and earnings beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Hill-Rom’s merger and acquisition activities are going strong. The company actively pursues buyouts to accelerate growth in five key clinical areas viz. patient mobility, wound care and prevention, surgical, safety and efficiency, clinical workflow solutions and respiratory help. Apart from Welch Allyn and Trumpf, the recent noteworthy acquisitions include that of Virtus, Aspen Surgical and Mortara Instrument.On the flip side, a decline in revenues at the Patient Support Systems segment is quite disappointing. Hill-Rom operates in a highly competitive space dominated by large as well as small and regional manufacturers. Also, unfavorable currency movement continues to be a threat as a large chunk of the company’s revenues is generated from international operations.Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2.

The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, the segment witnessed a 4% decline in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing, recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance.However, solid performance by the Specialty Solutions business partially offset the negative impact in the segment.Medical SegmentRevenues in the segment improved 18.6% to $4.04 billion, primarily on higher contributions from new and existing customers.Medical segment profits increased 38% to $220 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisition of the Patient Recovery business.Share-Repurchase ProgramThe company’s board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of the company’s common shares, which will expire on Dec 31, 2020.With the latest authorization, Cardinal Health is authorized to repurchase up to $1.3 billion of its common shares.MarginsAs a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 5.3% of net revenues. However, gross profit in the quarter was $1.86 billion, up 16% year over year.Distribution, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1313 billion.GuidanceConsidering the benefit of 40 cents per share from the lower federal rate due to U.S. tax reform, Cardinal Health raised fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $5.25-$5.50 per share, higher from the previous range of $4.85-$5.10.Our TakeCardinal Health exited the quarter on a solid note, courtesy of encouraging performance in the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.On the flip side, despite growth in business, profits at the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarter. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks. Recently, the company recently closed  divestiture of its Cardinal Health China distribution.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

277,PKI,"On Feb 7, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Over the last three months, this San Diego, CA-based company, providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has gained 4.7%, higher than the broader industry’s 1.4%.Illumina exited fourth-quarter 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the fronts. Additionally, revenues and earnings improved on a year-over-year basis. This apart, an improving margin scenario instilled investor confidence in the stock. We are also optimistic about Illumina’s expansion strategy through the enhancement of its portfolio of sequencing products and the development of strategic partnerships with therapeutic and diagnostic service providers. In this regard, in January 2018, Illumina signed a commercial agreement for distributing Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Ion AmpliSeq technology to researchers who conduct studies on Illumina’s next-generation sequencing platform. Currently, Illumina is focusing on product innovation through research and development as well, which is evident from the recent launch of iSeq 100 Sequencing System. Post a promising fourth quarter, we expect Illumina to maintain growth momentum on continued uptake of sequencing consumables, instruments and microarray portfolios.Meanwhile, Illumina faces stiff competition in the sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several large players already enjoying significant market share, intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise. Also, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue raises concern.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Emerging market revenues (14.9% of total revenues) amounted to $1.10 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11.8% as reported).Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic plc Quote Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 10% as reported) to $2.80 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.46 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 6% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) to $886 million on the back of low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 7% as reported) to $457 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, solid contributions from VenaSeal closure system drove high-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.04 billion, marking a 6% year-over-year increase at CER (down 16% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at CER.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.94 billion were up 5% year over year at CER (up 7% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single digit growth in Pain Therapies, at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 13% at CER (17% as reported) to $584 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 140 basis points (bps) to 70.3% on a 3.3% rise in gross profit to $5.18 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 bps year over year to 28.9% owing to a 5.3% rise in research and development expenses (to $558 million) along with a 4.6% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $140 million as compared with $46 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection at the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $480-$500 million impact on fiscal results compared with $275-$375 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.50 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is likely to have an adverse impact of 4 cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 2 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $300-$320 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected affect fourth-quarter earnings per share by 2 cents.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal third quarter on a solid note. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the company’s recent receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System under the Neurovascular unit within the RTG business buoys optimism. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

282,PKI,"On Feb 16, we issued an updated research report on Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Salt Lake City, UT-based molecular diagnostics provider has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months. The company has rallied 13.3%, against the industry’s 1% decline. Myriad Genetics exited the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a promising note. The company particularly observed strong growth in GeneSight testing revenues.  The company’s molecular-diagnostics portfolio has been gaining prominence in the MedTech space of late. We are particularly upbeat about the newly-launched range of products. Myriad Genetics has been recording strong volumes of EndoPredict and GeneSight tests. In the Prolaris testing space, volumes continued to grow double-digits in the fiscal second quarter.In particular, Myriad Genetics was focused on driving revenues by commercializing its innovative products, including Vectra DA, Prolaris, myPath Melanoma, Myriad Genetics’s Companion Diagnostics, EndoPredict and myPlan Lung Cancer Test. Earlier, management expected each of the products to generate revenues of more than $50 million by fiscal 2020.Moreover, Myriad Genetics has been consistently gaining reimbursement approvals. During the reported quarter, the company announced the finalization of LCD from Noridian for EndoPredict, thereby expanding the total coverage to around 90% of the U.S. market. Also, the Prolaris test is under evaluation for revised NCCN guidelines and has been covered by Medicare for patients at intermediate risk.  Also, in order to gain reimbursement coverage in Vectra DA and GeneSight testing platforms, the company has been undertaking certain measures.Furthermore, the raised FY18 guidance instills confidence. We are upbeat about growth in new product volumes, an expanded reimbursement for new products and an increase in international RNA kit revenues. Meanwhile, Myriad Genetics faces competition in the key BRACAnalysis market. The company expects competition to intensify owing to advancement of technology. We believe competitive headwinds might reduce prices of expensive tests provided by the company. This might impede margin improvement as well.Moreover, as the company receives a considerable portion of its revenues and pays a portion of its expenses in foreign currencies, it is at risk of exchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

283,PKI,"On Jan 29, we issued an updated research report on Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Integra LifeSciences has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 26.4%, compared with 4.6% gain of the industry. Integra LifeSciences has been witnessing key developments on the overseas front. International sales within specialty surgical increased in last reported quarter driven by strength in door repair and tissue ablation franchises in Asia Pacific and Europe.According to the company, the acquisition of Codman will effectively double the company’s international business within this segment. Within Orthopedics & Tissue Technologies, international sales increased double-digits largely on incremental revenues from Derma Sciences.Moreover, the consistently strong performance of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies’ segment buoys optimism. Notably, the company’s Regenerative Technologies is the largest franchise under Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies. In the last reported quarter, the company registered mid-single digits growth in this franchise primarily on the addition of Derma Sciences and strong growth in inpatient skin portfolio. Moreover, Integra LifeSciences introduced several products that have expanded its solutions portfolio in the United States hernia repair market and in the European breast reconstruction market. This should spur growth in 2018. We are also encouraged by the company‘s three-pillar strategy: optimize, execute and accelerate growth. According to management, this will help the company’s optimize its infrastructure, deliver commitments through improved planning and communication, and grow through the launch of products, internal development, geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions. However, Integra LifeSciences faces significant competition in the surgical implants and medical instruments market. The company needs to be innovative on the product front to fend off competition. Moreover, consolidation in the industry could lead to intense pricing pressure. Further, the company generates significant revenues from the international business, which increases its vulnerability to adverse currency movements.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Total $24.9 million of product, service and other revenues in the fourth quarter were 2% higher than the prior-year number.Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.

Quote Consumable revenues in the quarter under review were $12.7 million, up 70% on a year-over-year basis, marking the metric’s eighth consecutive quarter of growth on continued consumable sales momentum. This upside was driven by an increased utilization of the company’s growing installed base of sequel systems.Instrument revenues in the fourth quarter were $9.2 million, down from $13.1 million on a year-over-year basis as higher shipments of instruments took place in the latter part of 2016 and early 2017.The company has no record of contractual revenues in the quarter.Margin DetailsIn the fourth quarter, Pacific Biosciences generated gross profit of $9.5 million.

For the near term, the company anticipates first-quarter 2018 revenues to be slightly lower than the reported count in fourth-quarter 2017 due to seasonality.Our ViewpointPacific Biosciences ended the fourth quarter of 2017 on a promising note. Consumable revenue platform acted as a significant positive for Pacific Biosciences in the quarter. Sales momentum in China continued to remain strong on the company’s recent receipt of an order for 10 sequel systems from the premier sequencing service provider, BGI. The outlook for 2018 looks encouraging as well.Of the major concerns, the DNA sequencing market breeds stiff competition with several established players dominating the market. Aggressive rivalry in this niche space is a headwind. Also, higher operating expenses are likely to mar prospects.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Companies Reporting Solid Earnings ResultsA few better-ranked stocks that reported solid earnings this season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

286,PKI,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation’s (EW  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 94 cents, excluding net expense of $223.5 million or $1.04 per share as an impact of U.S. tax reform. Reported EPS came in at 17 cents.The adjusted EPS figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents by 4.4%. However, adjusted earnings improved 25.3% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS came in at $3.80, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.76 by 1.1%. Moreover, the figure beat the year-ago number by 31%.Sales DetailsFourth-quarter sales improved 15.7% to $888.5 million. Moreover, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $862.9 million by 2.9%. Underlying sales increased 15.9% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Net revenues in 2017 totaled $3.44 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.39 billion. The figure also improved 16.2% from the year-ago number.Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care product lines too.   Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote                                          Segments DetailsIn the fourth quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $519.3 million, reflecting 20.2% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT sales totaled $326.7 million, up 22.3% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $204.9 million, up 8.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and solid uptake of core products outside the United States.Critical Care sales were $164.3 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 12.3% from fourth-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company's core products, mainly in the United States and China.MarginsIn the fourth quarter, gross margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 73.5% owing to a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves. This was however partially offset by the shutdown of the company's manufacturing plant in Switzerland.SG&A expenses rose 14.2% year over year to $266.7 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment. R&D expenditures increased 27.6% year over year to $146.6 million owing to continued investments in the transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 20 bps to 27% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.34 billion, compared with $1.27 billion at the end of 2016. Long-term debt in 2017 totaled $438.4 million, compared with $822.3 million reported in the previous year.Cash flow from operating activities was $1 billion in 2017. Excluding capital spending of $168.1 million, free cash flow was $831.9 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 215.4 million. 2018 Guidance RaisedEdwards Lifesciences has raised its 2018 sales expectations to the high end of the previously projected range of $3.5-$3.9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is $3.71 billion, well within the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $4.43–$4.63 from the previous range of $4.10-$4.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $4.16, near the low end of the company’s guided range.For the first quarter of 2018, the company projects sales between $900 million and $950 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $889.2 million, below the company’s projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between $1.04 and $1.14. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is $1.01, which is also below the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the fourth quarter on a solid note. Strong transcatheter valve sales in the domestic market as well as overseas is a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front.Management expects to gain traction in the ever-expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidence, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are, PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report).

288,PKI,"VWR Corporation  announced opening of a new kitting center in Skalice, Czech Republic on the eve of the company to be taken over by Avantor. Per VWR, this new 35,000 square foot facility is strategically located and will be helpful for the company’s business in the high-prospect EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region.Notably, this new center will particularly help expand Therapak’s (acquired by VWR in 2016) existing footprint in Europe with advanced facility and comprehensive kitting services for regional as well as global customers.Location wise, this new center will assist the company’s VWRCATALYST offering to grow. This apart, proximity of this site to major industrial freight carrier hubs will enhance service levels compared with VWR’s current model. The facility will be fully operational on Oct 2, 2017.Notably, VWRCATALYST Clinical and Biorepository Services lend a complete solution to its global regulated research and product development clients in the pharma, biopharma, manufacturing and clinical trial industries. Earlier in 2017, VWRCATALYST acquired laboratory and medical equipment, plus the ancillary supplier MESM and an international biorepository services organization, EPL Archives.In this regard we note that over the last couple of years, VWR’s EMEA-APAC (Asia Pacific) segment has been experiencing an increase in comparable net sales, backed by several strategic initiatives implemented in recent times. This includes  a series  of  plans  to  significantly  upgrade  its information  technology  infrastructure,  optimize  distribution network  and  modify  marketing schemes.In the recently-reported second quarter, on an organic basis, net sales in EMEA-APAC improved 2.7%. Going forward, management expects the EMEA-APAC segment to continue its run of strong historical progress.However, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. In general, VWR competes with players like Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

289,PKI,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Waltham, MA-based PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). The company provides scientific instruments, consumables, and services to pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing, chemical, and general industrial markets worldwide. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PerkinElmer’s expanding product portfolio is helping the company win market share worldwide. Within a short span of time, its new products have gained significant traction among consumers. We believe the products will continue to boost the company’s market share in areas like diagnostics, research and environment.Moreover, PerkinElmer is well positioned to benefit from investments in the area of cancer immunotherapy as well as the rising trend of outsourcing instrument maintenance and scientific services over the long term.Acquisitions and strategic partnerships have been key catalysts for PerkinElmer over the years. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.The acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics will expand PerkinElmer’s reach in the autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets. The acquisition will also reinforce the company’s capabilities pertaining to new infectious diseases in the Chinese market. Per management, the acquisition is expected to add about 28 cents to 30 cents to 2018 adjusted earnings.PerkinElmer continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, it adds to integration risks. The frequent acquisitions can also negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets. Frequent acquisitions are also a distraction for management and impacts organic growth.Stock Performance at a GlancePerkinElmer’s share price movement in the past one year has been unsatisfactory. The company represented a return of almost 16%, a bit lower than the broader industry's return of almost 22.1%. The company has been witnessing weakness in academic markets outside the United States. Furthermore, lackluster performance in Europe impacted the company’s third-party logistics in the second quarter.The estimate revision trend has been favorable for PerkinElmer over the last two months. For the current quarter, five estimates moved north compared to one movement in the opposite direction, while for the full year eight estimates moved north over the same time frame.This has had a significant impact on the magnitude of the estimates as the current quarter estimates increased 2.8%, while full-year estimates inched 1% up over the same time frame.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The figure remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell within the company's guided range of 32-35 cents for adjusted EPS.The adjustments take into consideration the estimated net income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the benefit related to the re-measurement of the company's deferred taxes arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.Without these adjustments, the company reported a loss of 45 cents per share compared with EPS of 9 cents in the year-ago period.For the full year, adjusted EPS came in at $1.26, a 13.5% increase from the year-ago number.

However, balanced growth across all business lines and geographies were impressive. Also, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has also started to contribute to the company’s overall topline performance. The promising 2018 view is all the more encouraging and indicative of this overall bullish trend to continue in the near term.Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies as well as global markets, accounting for higher sales across all its geographies in the fourth quarter. We are also optimistic about the company gaining a number of product approvals both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning are the FDA approvals for the company’s Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System (to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease) and the Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (to simultaneously provide paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapy).

292,PKI,"Headquartered in Waltham, MA, PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report) provides scientific instruments, consumables, and services to pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing, chemical, and general industrial markets worldwide. The company is expected to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3, after the closing bell.PerkinElmer reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Notably, adjusted earnings surpassed management’s guided range of 52 cents to 54 cents. The company reported adjusted revenues of $514.3 million, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $506 million. Interestingly, revenues were above management’s guided range of $500–$510 million.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors to ConsiderGuidance Upbeat: For the second quarter of 2017, PerkinElmer projects revenues in the range of $550 million to $555 million, which represents organic revenue growth of approximately 3% to 4%. Notably, this includes a 2% foreign exchange headwind. Second-quarter adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 66 cents to 68 cents.Expansion in Asia: PerkinElmer acquired Goa, India-based Tulip Diagnostics Private Ltd for an undisclosed amount. Although Tulip was acquired in early January, we are bullish about the buyout as it will help PerkinElmer tap into the opportunities in the emerging market of diagnostics. The takeover is also likely to strengthen PerkinElmer’s foothold in the infectious disease testing space.Foreign Exchange Volatility: Increasing exposure to the international markets enhances the risk of foreign exchange volatility. The fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales. Due to the sluggish European economy, revenues and earnings are likely to be affected adversely if the company does not hedge from exposure to currency fluctuations.Estimate Revision: PerkinElmer’s estimate revision trend remained stable at the moment. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The current quarter earnings estimates stand at 67 cents per share.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for PerkinElmer this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PerkinElmer is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 67 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PerkinElmer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.
