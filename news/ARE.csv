1,ARE,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (ARE  -  Free Report) board of directors announced a 3% hike in the company's quarterly dividend rate to 93 cents from 90 cents paid in the previous quarter. The new dividend is scheduled to be paid on Jul 16, to shareholders of record as of Jun 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.72 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $3.6 per share. This leads to an annualized yield of 2.9%, considering the retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) closing price of $127.2 on Jun 4.Notably, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for real estate investment trusts (REIT) investors and Alexandria had earlier announced a 5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2017 dividend. This reflects the company’s continued efforts to improve shareholder wealth.Per management, this hike is in sync with the Pasadena, CA-based REIT’s strategy of sharing growth in cash flows from operating activities with the stockholders, while also retaining a significant portion to reinvest in its strong development and redevelopment pipeline that comprises new Class A properties. Also, as of Mar 31, 2018, the funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio remained at 56%, which is a favorable level. Hence, this dividend is expected to remain sustainable.In fact, Alexandria has robust fundamentals to back dividend hikes. In fact, the company has been a decent performer, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, with an average positive surprise of 0.48%.As investors prefer an income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to invest their money in.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed its industry in the past six months. Shares of Alexandria have inched up 1%, as against the industry’s loss of 3.2%. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc.

2,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (ARE  -  Free Report) robust fundamentals of the life-science industry have enabled the company’s Class A properties in AAA locations to enjoy high occupancy. Also, the company’s effort to improve credit profile is encouraging. It has an adequate capital buffer, which will likely cushion its position during any adverse situation. However, the company’s global footprint makes its profitability vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Further, near-term dilution effects from the sale of assets remain a concern for the company.Recently, this urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of $1.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59. Results reflected solid internal and external growth. Further, the company experienced an increase in rental rate and net operating income (NOI).Notably, Alexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which, in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company. In fact, as of first-quarter 2018, 57% of the annual rental revenues in effect were derived from investment-grade or large-cap tenants, whereas 79% of the annual rental revenues came in from Class A properties in AAA locations.Further, the company continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. During first-quarter 2018, same-property cash NOI growth was solid at 14.6%. Leasing activity for the quarter was also decent at around 1.5 million rentable square feet (RSF). The company carried out lease renewals and re-leasing of space at rental-rate growth of 19.0%, on a cash basis.In addition, robust external growth, in forms of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations, is likely to boost the company’s operating performance. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, the company placed into service 91,155 RSF at its development project at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge submarket, which is fully leased to four high-quality biotechnology entities, and 27,315 RSF at its redevelopment project at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in Route 128 submarket leased to Visterra, Inc. Further, during the aforementioned period, Alexandria commenced development projects, aggregating 651,951 RSF.Moreover, Alexandria has an adequate financial flexibility to cushion and enhance its market position. The company had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of first-quarter 2018. Also, it has a well-laddered debt-maturity schedule. Importantly, Alexandria improved its credit profile over the past two years.Nonetheless, Alexandria has exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries, which exposes it to risks from currency fluctuations. Further, the company follows the strategy of recycling capital from real estate sales, including non-core operating assets to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. However, the near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Moreover, a rise in interest rates is a challenge for Alexandria as the company has exposure to long-term leased assets. Any rise in rates would increase the cost of financing acquisitions, as well as investment and development activity expenses. Furthermore, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, in the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. During that time frame, shares of Alexandria have depreciated 2.9%, narrower than the 6.4% decline incurred by its industry. Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised marginally upward in a month’s time. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to see a favorable trend in price. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Arbor Realty Trust’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share rose 14.4% to $1.03 over the past month.

Its shares have gained 2.3% over the past three months.Host Hotels & Resorts’ FFO per share estimates for 2018 witnessed rise of 3% and moved to $1.71 over the past month.

The company had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of the first quarter.OutlookAlexandria expects adjusted FFO per share in the band of $6.52-$6.62 for 2018.

Notably, strong fundamentals of the life-science industry have enabled the company’s Class A properties in upscale locations to enjoy high occupancy. Additionally, Alexandria’s efforts to improve credit profile look encouraging. The company has adequate capital buffer which will likely cushion its position during any adverse situation. However, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns.Alexandria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

4,ARE,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts of 96 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. The figure came in lower than the year-ago quarter tally of $1.03.Results reflected an increase in property-level operating expenses.Ventas posted revenues of $943.7 million in the first quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $850.6 million. Further, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $883.4 million.For the first quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for the total portfolio (1,049 assets) climbed 2.6% year over year. Segment-wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 4.4%, seniors housing operating portfolio witnessed rise of 0.7% and medical office building portfolio rose 2.2%.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Ventas signed a mutually-beneficial agreement with Brookdale Senior living which currently operates the company’s 128 wholly-owned senior housing communities. It combines all of the company’s leases with Brookdale into a single Master lease, with an initial term through Dec 2025. Brookdale has two 10-year extension options as well.Brookdale and Ventas also plan to sell a few properties from the Brookdale portfolio, totaling $30 million in cash rent.LiquidityVentas exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $92.5 million, up from $81.4 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Updated 2018 OutlookVentas updated 2018 normalized FFO per share outlook to $3.99-$4.07 from the previous range of $3.95-$4.05.The company updated same-store cash net operating income growth to 0.5-1.5% in 2018 from 0.5-2% issued earlier.Our TakeVentas is poised to grow on the back of its diversified portfolio, strategic acquisitions and strong balance sheet. Rising healthcare spending and aging population augur well for long-term growth. Moreover, the mutual agreement, which the company has signed with Brookdale, is likely to provide further support to Ventas.However, an elevated supply of seniors’ housing assets in certain markets is likely to put pressure on rent and occupancy growth in the near-term. Further, the company is exposed to concentration risks since the majority of its revenues are generated from a few tenants. Hike in interest rate is also a concern.Ventas, Inc.

Excluding other items, operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 improved by about $4.1 million.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $19.9 million compared with $13.5 million, recorded in the year-ago period.

The figure also came in 13% higher than the year-ago tally of 92 cents.Adjusted revenues, including minimum rents, overage rents and expense recoveries, for the quarter came in at $141 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $144 million. Also, revenues were down nearly 2% from the prior-year quarter.The quarter experienced higher rents and greater lease cancellation income. Further, cost-saving initiatives executed in the previous year enabled the company to enjoy lower general and administrative expenses.Quarter in DetailComparable center net operating income (NOI) climbed 9.2% for the quarter. Average rent per square foot in comparable centers came in at $57.73, up 3.9% from the prior-year quarter. For the period ended Mar 31, 2018, the trailing 12-month releasing spreads per square foot were 4.4%.Moreover, comparable center mall tenant sales per square foot rose 12.4% in the reported quarter.

Also, the guidance does not include any future costs that might be incurred related to shareowner activism.Our ViewpointTaubman recorded encouraging NOI growth during the Jan-Mar quarter. The company’s operating performance benefited from the new comparable centers in the quarter.  In addition, it witnessed robust growth in sales per square foot.However, the prevalent choppy retail real estate environment remains a concern for the company. In fact, with a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and growing online retail, mall traffic continues to suffer. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. This is expected to impact demand for retail space at Taubman’s shopping centers. Furthermore, it has been witnessing elevated levels of tenant turnover for the past two years.Taubman Centers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taubman Centers, Inc.

7,ARE,"Welltower Inc. (WELL  -  Free Report) reported normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 99 cents for first-quarter 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, on a year-over-year basis, the figure declined 5.7% from $1.05.Results highlight a choppy seniors housing market.However, the company posted revenues of nearly $1.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion. It also compared favorably with the year-ago number of $1.06 billion.Importantly, it was announced that Welltower and ProMedica Health System would acquire Quality Care Properties (QCP) real estate in newly-formed joint venture (80/20), for $20.75 per share. Also, ProMedica entered into a definitive deal to acquire the operations of HCR ManorCare and Arden Courts, QCP's principal tenants. In addition, ProMedica would enter into a 15-year absolute triple-net master lease as a tenant-to-real estate joint venture.Notably, this $2.2-billion Welltower investment is estimated to provide around 20 cents per share annual accretion to the company. Further, it represents an 8% initial cash yield and 1.8xproperty level EBITDAR coverage, with corporate lease guarantee from a secure investment grade health system. Moreover, with this partnership, ProMedica will gain immediate scale in the rapidly growing home health, post-acute and memory-care markets. It will invest as much as $400 million in capex over the next five years.Quarter in DetailTotal portfolio same-store net operating income (SSNOI) inched up 1.8% year over year, mainly driven by growth in seniors housing triple-net, outpatient medical and long-term/post-acute care segments.Welltower accomplished $578 million of pro-rata gross investments in the first quarter. This included $476 million in acquisitions/joint ventures, $59 million in development funding, as well as $43 million in loans. Notably, the company completed 67% of these investments with present relationships.On the other hand, the company accomplished total dispositions of $987 million in the quarter. This comprised loan payoffs of $92 million and property sales of $895 million.The company exited first-quarter 2018 with $202.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, down from $380.4 million recorded at the end of the prior-year quarter. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company had $2.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under its primary unsecured credit facility. Furthermore, it extinguished secured debt of $183 million during the reported quarter.Dividend UpdateWelltower announced a cash dividend of 87 cents per share for the first quarter. The dividend will be paid on May 23 to stockholders of record on May 8, 2018. This marks the company’s 188th consecutive quarterly cash dividend payout to stockholders.2018 OutlookDue to timing variability associated with the completion of the ProMedica joint venture and acquisition of Quality Care Properties, the company has not included enhanced acquisition-activity guidance in its current earnings outlook. As such, Welltower affirmed its normalized FFO per share outlook of $3.95-$4.05 for 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.03.Also, the company anticipates its 2018 average blended SSNOI growth of around 1-2%. In addition, the company increased its 2018 disposition proceeds projection to $1.9 billion from the $1.3 billion guided earlier.Our TakeWelltower’s partnership with ProMedica Health System is a strategic fit. It spans the entire spectrum of care, including wellness, post-acute, assisted living, memory care, hospice and home health, and gives the company solid scope to capitalize on the individual market dynamics.Nonetheless, the seniors housing market remains challenging. Additionally, rate hike is a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets.

It boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. Moreover, the company is focusing on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. In fact, recently, Simon Property announced substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls, in order to benefit the existing retailers.Admittedly, Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. However, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its profit margins in the near term. Also, rate hike has added to its woes.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 3.0% rise in realized annual rent per occupied square foot to $17.30. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 92.3% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 127 self-storage facilities acquired and developed since January 2016.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million.

13,ARE,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.18 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s core FFO per share also recorded 4.3% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.09.Total revenues of $560.8 million increased 7.4% year over year, as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth. The revenue figure also came in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $558.5 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. However, occupancy level declined marginally, while operating expense flared up due to property taxes, payroll and insurance costs.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.5% year over year, while economic occupancy edged down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that have stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2017, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.4% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates but partially offset by a decline in economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities escalated 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities inched up 1.2 % year over year to around $295.4 million.Notably, during the first quarter, the company accomplished the development of three communities, for an aggregate total capital cost of $287.0 million. These communities comprise a total of 770 apartment homes. Further, the company purchased two land parcels for future development, for a total investment of $57.08 million. The company intends to commence construction of apartment communities on this land this year.As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had 18 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 5,774 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.65 billion. This includes the company’s share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $271.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share of $2.16-$2.22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.21.In ConclusionAvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Moreover, stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for higher apartment demand during the peak leasing period.Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. In addition, high concession activity amid elevated supply remains a concern. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Rate hike remains another concern.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

This compares favorably with the year-ago figure of 37 cents.The company posted revenues from rental properties of $230.4 million in the reported quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.2%. Moreover, total revenues improved 3.6% to $304.1 million year over year.Notably, the company registered new leasing spreads of 15.6%. This represents the 16th sequential increase in rental rate for new leases by more than 10% over the prior rent for the comparable space.Quarter in DetailAt the end of the first quarter, pro-rata occupancy came in at 96.1%, indicating a sequential expansion of 10 basis points (bps), and 80 bps year over year.Same-property net operating income (NOI) climbed 2.6% year over year.

The company projects FFO per share at $1.42-$1.46, similar to the previous guidance. This is based on same-property NOI growth (excluding redevelopments) projections of 1.5-2.00%, net disposition estimations of $700-$900 million, and total redevelopment & development investment of $425-$525 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2018 FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.44.Share Repurchase ProgramThe company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $24.3 million under its $300-million share-repurchase program in the first quarter.  Our ViewpointWe are impressed by Kimco’s performance which indicates higher leasing spreads, same-property NOI and occupancy. In addition, the company remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non-strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States. Further, its share buyback program raises optimism.Nevertheless, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are expected to hurt this retail REIT’s performance. Also, we note that aggressive disposition activities have a dilutive impact on earnings and might impede the company’s growth in the short run.Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteKimco currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Further, the company’s investments in high-growth markets are anticipated to boost its leasing metrics.Nonetheless, the company faces stiff competition from other market players.

16,ARE,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) reported funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of 47 cents for first-quarter 2018, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 45 cents.Total revenues in the reported quarter rose 3.9% year over year to $253.3 million. Further, the top line came marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $253 million. Growth in revenues for the first quarter were due to the rise in revenues from same-store communities, stabilized, non-mature and development communities.Inside the HeadlinesDuring the quarter, same-store revenues increased 3% year over year while same-store expenses increased 3.6%. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) rose 2.7% year over year. This residential REIT’s same-store physical occupancy grew 30 basis point (bps) to 96.9%. The first-quarter annualized-rate of turnover contracted 120 basis points from the prior-year period to 40%.At the end of the first quarter, UDR’s development pipeline aggregated $810.5 million at its pro-rata ownership interest. Out of which, 91% has already been funded.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had around $843.4 million available from a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on its credit facilities. Further, its total debt was $3.7 billion as of the same date.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 593,000 shares at an average price of $33.69, totaling approximately $20 million.Portfolio ActivityAt the end of the first quarter, the company’s Developer Capital Program investment, including accrued return, totaled $159.3 million.GuidanceFor second-quarter 2018, UDR projects FFO as adjusted per share to be 47-49 cents range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents lies at the higher end of this guidance.For full-year 2018, the company reaffirmed its estimates. The FFO as adjusted per share remains at $1.91-$1.95. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 lies within this range. Moreover, the company anticipates same-store revenues, expenses and same-store NOI to remain in the range of 2.5-3.5% for the year.Our ViewpointUDR’s portfolio, located in the targeted U.S. markets, has a superior product-mix. Further, the company’s focus on enhancing the portfolio through expansion in core markets and the sale of non-core ones is likely to support long-term growth. Also, during the quarter, UDR declared a 4% increase in annualized common dividend for 2018.However, the company continues to deal with an elevated level of apartment supply in a number of its markets. This is likely to limit the landlord’s ability to demand higher rents while increasing concessional activities. Moreover, any rise in interest rates remains a concern for the company.United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

The first-quarter dividend will be paid on May 31 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2018.Our ViewpointIn a bid to transform into a domestic-focused industrial-property REIT, Duke Realty resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past. The company is well positioned to benefit from escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities in strategic in-fill locations.However, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term.

However, the top line fell short of $231 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Quarter in DetailSame-store net operating income (NOI) for the total portfolio on a pro rata basis, excluding Puerto Rico, was 2.6%.

New DDR informed about the assets that are going to remain within the company after the completion of the $900-million disposition program and the spin-off of RVI.For third-quarter 2018, the company continues to expect OFFO to be at least 15 cents, assuming a spin-off date in July 2018. Net income attributable to shareholders is expected to be two to three cents per share.Bottom LineIn December 2017, DDR announced its board's decision to spin off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded REIT. This move might help the company streamline its portfolio and focus on the core markets. Further, this aggressive capital-recycling program is expected to drive the company's growth over the long term.However, the choppy retail real estate environment is anticipated to limit demand for space in the near term, thanks to the shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases.

20,ARE,"Boston Properties Inc.’s (BXP  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.49 was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was also higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.48. In addition, quarterly FFO per share was within the company’s previously guided range of $1.47-$1.49.Adjusted revenues, comprising base rent and recoveries from tenants during the quarter, increased 3.7% year over year to $614.6 million. The figure also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604.5 million. The rise was attributable to increases in both the revenue components.Property UpdateAs of Mar 31, 2018, Boston Properties’ portfolio comprised 179 properties, covering a total of around 50.3 million square feet. This included 13 under development properties, covering an area of 6.5 million square feet.The overall operating portfolio, including 163 properties (excluding two residential properties and hotel), was 90.5% leased as of Mar 31, 2018.Portfolio ActivityDuring the first quarter, Boston Properties entered an agreement with Leidos to construct a build-to-suit project which would include a Class A office space at company's 17Fifty Presidents Street development project located in Reston, VA, having about 276,000 net rentable square feet. The development of the project has started and will be ready for occupancy by the second quarter of 2020.Further, the company partly placed 508 apartments and retail spaces in service, spanning across 515,000 square feet, situated in Reston, VA.Also, Boston Properties entered a binding lease agreement with Fannie Mae for its Reston Gateway project in Reston, VA. Per the agreement, the company will lease approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of space to Fannie Mae out of nearly 1.1 million net rentable square feet, which is to be constructed on the Reston Gateway property. The construction, which awaits a few approvals, will begin during the second half of 2018.Liquidity DecreasesBoston Properties exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $294.6 million, down from $434.8 million as of Dec 31, 2017.OutlookBoston Properties updated its full-year 2018 FFO per share guidance to $6.27-$6.36 from $6.23-$6.36 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.31.The company projects its second-quarter 2018 FFO per share of $1.53-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.58.Our ViewpointBoston Properties is well poised for growth, with the support of properties located in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets and diversified tenants along with industry base. In fact, ownership of properties in strategic areas enabled Boston Properties to enter into a lease agreement with Fannie Mae for its Virginia property, which is currently under construction. Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in the demand for office spaces is expected to strengthen the company’s growth opportunities.However, the market is witnessing growth in the supply of office spaces, which remains a concern as higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rent. A few big financial players are resizing their businesses and trying to cut costs, which is affecting demand for office spaces.

21,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Apr 30, after the market closes. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow sequentially.Last quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. The company witnessed a year-over-year rise in expenses related to rental operations and interest expenses.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in another and missed in the other, coming up with an average positive surprise of around 0.3%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe fundamentals of the office real estate market remained moderate in the first quarter. In fact, going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE), although new supply for the quarter exceeded the 10-million-square-foot mark, totaling 12.3 million square feet of space, 70% of these deliveries were pre-leased. Encouragingly, around half of the total space, currently under construction, has already been pre-leased at higher rates. This underscores high demand for premier office space in major office markets.This operating environment remains favorable for Alexandria, which focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. Its properties are located in markets with high barriers to entry and exit. This adds to the productivity and efficiency of tenants. We anticipate this to help the company generate steady revenues from its properties in the to-be-reported quarter. Further, in the past three months, shares of the company have lost 4.5%, while the industry incurred a loss of 7.1%.  However, per the study, high level of new supply in the Jan-Mar quarter has resulted in an uptick in overall vacancy rates by 20 basis points (bps). Further, in contrast to the recent peak rates witnessed by the industry, rent growth was sluggish in the quarter, merely inching up 0.7% sequentially. Further, the industry is witnessing a shift from downtown markets toward sub-urban areas, as evident in the high annual growth rates in the sub-urban office spaces.We expect this changing landscape to impact the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Sluggish rental growth will likely limit its operating margins and high vacancies might add to its concerns.In addition to the above, Alexandria’s strategy to sell non-core operating assets and non-strategic land parcels is expected to have affected its bottom-line growth in the quarter.Hence, there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the first-quarter earnings release. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter fell by a cent to $1.59 over the past month, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

23,ARE,"Office real estate investment trust (REIT) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) has a particular focus on collaborative life-science and technology campuses. The company, which is based in Pasadena, CA, specifically emphasizes on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses.These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, in turn, ensuring steady rental revenues for the company.

The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life-science markets. It enjoys a solid 10-year historical occupancy rate of 95%, which is anticipated to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Alexandria continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. The year 2017 marked its second highest year of leasing volume at nearly 4.6 million rentable square feet. Further, the company achieved rental rate growth of 12.7% on lease renewals and re-leasing of space.

Also, strong internal and external growth, robust cash flow and solid balance sheet are its strengths. However, disposition of non-core assets has a dilutive impact on its earnings. Further, a rise in the rate of interest and foreign currency fluctuations are the concerns before it.Late January, Alexandria reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of $1.53 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Nonetheless, the figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter tally. The company also witnessed encouraging year-over-year growth in revenues, with full-year 2017 revenues exceeding $1 billion for the first time.Alexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2017, 55% of the annual rental revenues were derived from investment-grade tenants, whereas 80% of the annual rental revenues came from Class A properties in AAA locations.Additionally, the company continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. During fourth-quarter 2017, same-property cash net operating income (NOI) growth was solid at 4.5%. The quarter saw rental-rate growth of about 24.8% and on a cash basis, it was up 10.4%. In addition, robust external growth, in the form of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations, is likely to boost the company’s operating performance.Nonetheless, Alexandria follows the strategy of recycling capital from high-value assets and the sale of non-core operating assets and non-strategic land parcels to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. In fact, the company continues to look for opportunities to dispose non-core assets throughout 2018. The near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Further, the rise in interest rates is a challenge for Alexandria as the company has an exposure to long-term leased assets. Any rise in rates would increase the cost of financing acquisitions as well as investment and development activity expenses. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Alexandria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past three months, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has declined 1.9%, the industry has lost 10% during this period.

This dividend will be paid on Mar 6 to stockholders on record as of Feb 23, 2018, and is equivalent to 78.9% of normalized FFO per share.Our TakeAlthough Healthcare Realty missed estimates by a whisker, solid operating performance mirrors encouraging prospects for the company.The aging baby-boomer generation and greater longevity will likely augment demand for healthcare facilities. Subsequently, the company’s increased medical facility buyouts provide opportunities to become resilient.However, intense competition and estimated hike in interest rates are expected to curtail the company’s growth momentum in the near term.Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated QuoteHealthcare Realty carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Performance of Other REITsVentas (VTR  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized FFO of $1.03 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

27,ARE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 31, after the market closes. Revenues are expected to grow sequentially.Last quarter, this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.5%. Results witnessed same-property net operating income growth on the back of robust rental growth. Nonetheless, total occupancy declined sequentially.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 6%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteNotably, Duke Realty’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 8.5% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 3% gain recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Duke Realty is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).This combination of a 0.00% ESP and a Zacks Rank #4 makes it difficult to predict a beat this season.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations for improving supply chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks have been increasing. This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer modern, bulk distribution properties, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial assets. Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its MOB portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion. The company generated $2.45 billion in proceeds in the second quarter, through this sale. Further, in the third quarter, Duke Realty substantially accomplished the sale of seven of the nine medical office buildings, spanning 519,000 square feet. Such efforts are aimed at simplifying the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.While such streamlining efforts are strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results.Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 30 cents, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst. Also, it points to a year-over-year decline of 3.2%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $175 million, indicating a decline of 14.3% year over year.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $736.8 million. The consensus estimate for FFO per is $1.24, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 3.3%. Further, management expects core FFO per share in the range of $1.21-$1.25.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Jan 29, has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.

28,ARE,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 1.95%. Results indicated an improvement in portfolio operations, and development and management services revenues.Further, Boston Properties has a decent surprise history. The company exceeded estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.6%. This is depicted in the chart below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteNotably, Boston Properties’ fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 3.1% in the past six months, outperforming the 2.1% decline of the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Boston Properties will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because, it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsBoston Properties, based out of Massachusetts, concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.Per a recent study by CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the U.S. office vacancy rate increased 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter. The elevation is due to the rise in supply and a minor loosening of the market. However, in most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy rates declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office space is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $638.3 million, indicating estimated growth of 0.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for base rent of $515 million reflects marginal growth from the prior-quarter figure.However, the consensus estimate for development and management services is projected to be $8.24 million, down 23.8% sequentially.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter decreased 2.6% to $1.49, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments. Also, it reflects a year-over-year decline of 3.3%. The company projects fourth-quarter FFO per share to be in the range of $1.53-$1.54.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues came in at $2.55 billion, whereas, the consensus estimate for FFO per share came in at $6.23, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 3.3%.

30,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 29, after the market closes. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share as well as revenues are anticipated to be up year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses, delivered a better-than-expected FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in another and missed in the other. The company delivered an average positive surprise of around 0.3% during this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Alexandria is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and Alexandria has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.65%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Alexandria’s Zacks Rank #3 further increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsThe fundamentals of the office real estate market remained decent in the fourth quarter. In fact, going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm CBRE Group Inc. , although the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during the quarter amid an uptick in supply, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets.For Alexandria, which focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities, the operating environment is likely to have remained favorable in the quarter under review. The locations of its properties are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. The highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants.Moreover, high demand for Class A properties in AAA locations is likely to have boosted the level of occupancy in the quarter under review. The company has been witnessing elevated demand for space in key life-science markets.This trend is anticipated to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well and helped generate steady rental revenues from its properties. Also, Alexandria is expected to have adequate financial flexibility to cushion and enhance its market position.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $299.8 million, reflecting a 20.3% rise from the prior-year quarter figure. In addition, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $1.54. It reflects a year-over-year improvement of nearly 8.5%.Alexandria’s shares have climbed 6.2% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s loss of 3.2%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #3.

32,ARE,"Investors can be lured by profits of companies that have already released earnings figures. However, rather than accumulating the stock later, investing in the ones which are yet to report and poised to beat, can fetch more gains. This is because an earnings beat serves as a catalyst, raises investors’ confidence in a stock and results in further price appreciation.And if you believed that the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have put REITs on the back foot, then this is the right time to think again. Apart from the rate factor, underlying asset class dynamics play a vital role in determining the operating performance of REITs, and a number of asset categories have been displaying strength, of late.These categories have been generating solid returns, at times even above the broader market. Most importantly, there is scope for increasing future cash flows because such asset categories have enough scope to excel in the future due to the presence of favorable market conditions.Particularly, consider the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected mall traffic and compelled retailers to reconsider their business model in recent times. This same boom has created significant opportunity for the data centers, cell tower and industrial REITs that offer the critical infrastructure in the e-commerce value chain. In fact, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers.Also, going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets.Although mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords have consequently felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail, some other retail REITs are now focusing on grocery-anchored shopping centers. These centers are usually necessity driven and steer a dependable traffic, which augurs well for the industry. Moreover, groceries mark one of the major categories of U.S. consumer spending. Although online retailers like Amazon.com (AMZN) have made efforts to penetrate deeper into the grocery business, only a minimal percentage of U.S. grocery shopping takes place online.Finally, instead of heavy dependence on apparel and accessories that can be purchased online, the REITs which are more focused on expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities are poised to gain because such strategic measures are likely to boost traffic at the properties.The Zacks MethodologyHowever, in spite of the drivers, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are four REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release fourth-quarter results:Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of + 0.65%.

33,ARE,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Jan 24.While the company’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, it lagged the same in the remaining two quarters with an average beat of 2.53%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry may reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle’s top line.The merger between AT&T and Leap Wireless had a bearing on Crown Castle as it has 1,300 towers with both the carriers. Likewise, the combined entity of T-Mobile US and MetroPCS negatively impacted Crown Castle that had 1,400 towers jointly shared by these companies. Also, the merger between Sprint and Clearwire served as a hurdle for Crown Castle as both share 2,700 of its towers.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Historically, the top four among its customers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, accounted for majority of its total revenues, of which AT&T contributes a handful amount of site rental revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services are likely to weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.On the flip side, Crown Castle’s continuous efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators - FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014).On Jun 26, 2017, Crown Castle International completed the acquisition of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. Notably, Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, Internet access and colocation services in Southern California. Currently, it owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego. As a result, Crown Castle gained 28,000 route miles of fiber.On Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle completed the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash (subject to certain limited adjustments). With this buyout, Crown Castle is anticipated to attain ownership over 60,000 route miles of fiber. These deals are expected to increase opportunities for small cell network deployments in top metro markets.Moreover, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), fixed wireless broadband.Markedly, IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. Going forward, it is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Crown Castle’s shares have gained 5.17%, against the industry’s loss of 2.99% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.16%. This is because; the Most Accurate estimate is $1.07 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.06.

34,ARE,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Wednesday, Jan 24, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a negative surprise of 5.1%. The company’s Q3 results reflect a decline in rental revenues and steep fall in investment income. Also, the office landlord exited the quarter with lower liquidity.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, met in another and missed in the remaining two. The company delivered an average positive surprise of around 1% over this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteShares of SL Green declined 7.9% over the past six months compared with the industry’s descend of 3.9%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that SL Green is likely to beat estimates this time around because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and SL Green has the right mix.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SL Green is +0.34%.Zacks Rank: SL Green’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsThe company has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected to be $48.7 million, indicating 1.7% growth sequentially.In addition, per a recent study from CBRE Group, the U.S. office vacancy rate increased 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter. The elevation is due to the rise in supply and a minor loosening of the market. However, in most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy rates declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter property net rental revenues is currently pegged at $278 million, reflecting a 1.1% rise from the previous quarter figure.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter increased marginally to $1.60, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. Also, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 11.9%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Jan 29, has an Earnings ESP of +0.65% and a Zacks Rank #3.

35,ARE,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) reported an in-line result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Though the company experienced improved operating environment in the quarter, it did not recognize any promote income.However, Prologis has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and met in the other two, over the preceding four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 2.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 66 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, backed by the recovering economy and job-market improvements, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Amid this, Prologis has the capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The company also has solid balance-sheet strength. Also, its build-to-suit activity remained impressive in the second half of 2017, with the company completing 13 development projects. With a total expected investment (TEI) of approximately $350 million (on a Prologis-share basis), these projects included more than 4.7 million square feet of space.Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) was awarded 21 build-to-suit development projects during the same period, denoting over 6.7 million square feet of space. The TEI of these developments totaled roughly $550 million on a Prologis-share basis.In fact, for full-year 2017, the company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space. During the year, it also commenced 38 projects with a TEI of nearly $1.1 billion.Notably, this high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank as well as the sturdy network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. In fact, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and chances of any sound improvement in rent and occupancy growth in the to-be-reported quarter seem limited.Rather, there is intense competition in the market. Also, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to elevated supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $532 million, denoting a drop of 5% from the year-ago quarter.Therefore, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 66 cents per share over the past 30 days.Furthermore, Prologis has underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have dipped 4.6%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.3% during this time frame.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +0.10%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

36,ARE,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its quarterly common dividend, giving shareholders a reason to rejoice. Specifically, the company will now pay a dividend of 63 cents per share, up from 60 cents paid in the prior quarter. The increased dividend will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders of record as on Jan 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the 2018 annual dividend comes to $2.52 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 3.53%, considering Vornado’s closing price of $71.30 on Jan 17. Though this is lower than the industry average of 4.36%, the hike will likely increase investors’ confidence in the stock.Notably, Vornado has a concentration of high-quality assets, with a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District, as well as theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities.This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, is anticipated to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth engine over the long term.Moreover, the company, focused on improving its core business, has been making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, well-planned sell-outs provide the company with dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions.The 2017 spin-off of its Washington, D.C properties made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. The focus on New York is a strategic fit given that the city is preferred by businesses, residents, tourists and investors. It enjoys solid long-term employment growth with a diversified employment base. In addition, the city attracts international tourists and enjoys steady tourism growth.Also, the previous spin-off of its shopping center business into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties (UE  -  Free Report) was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. Such efforts to streamline the company’s business are likely to drive Vornado’s long-term growth.Vornado boasts a strong liquidity position with decent leverage and well-manageable debt maturities. As of Sep 30, 2017, Vornado had nearly $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, in October 2017, the company announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.The company is likely to benefit from improvement in the economy and the job market. However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Further, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 4.7%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.6% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Vornado some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report), Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) and Ventas, Inc.

37,ARE,"Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to vend 500 E St. SW to an affiliate of Boyd Watterson Asset Management, a Cleveland-based company, per bizjournals.com. Sold for $452 per square foot, totaling $118.56 million, the Washington building is leased to International Trade Commission. According to the source, the deal hasn’t been formally announced by either of the companies, but was recorded by the D.C. Recorder of Deeds.Boston Properties has been focusing on the successful execution of its capital allocation strategy. In particular, the company is boosting its portfolio through a repositioning program by acquisitions, divestitures and development of properties in core markets. Notably, in July 2016, Boston Properties obtained a 49.8% stake in the Colorado Center in Santa Monica, CA. This was made for an aggregate gross amount of approximately $511.1 million. The buyout marked the company’s foray into the expanding Westside Los Angeles market.Further, a low interest rate environment and lucrative pricing have encouraged the company to pursue active monetization of its assets. For this, it has been focusing on the disposal of non-core assets.Meanwhile, Boyd Watterson focuses on acquiring properties which are leased by federal agencies. In September 2017, it bought 800 N. Capitol St, NW, a property in D.C., leased by US General Services Administration for $119.75 million or $381 per square foot.Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRE  -  Free Report) also recently issued a non-binding letter of intent to divest 2445 M Street NW — a 292,000-square foot D.C. office building, which has been initiated by Washington REIT with an institutional buyer.

During the year, it also started 38 projects which have a TEI of nearly $1.1 billion.These comprise 47% of the company’s total development TEI for 2017 and indicate an increase of more than 45% as compared to the prior year’s TEI for build-to-suit projects.      Also, the company signed agreements for more than 70% of these starts with multi-site customers, while more than 95% of the customers are located in global markets.Notably, this high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank as well as the strong network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. In fact, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013.The industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, thanks to the rising Internet retailing and supply-chain consolidation. This, in turn, is generating greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks.

39,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) recently priced its public offering of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at $123.50 per share. This share offering is related to a forward-sale deal signed by the company with Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch and Citibank, N.A.  The underwriters have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 common shares. The offering, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close on or around Jan 8, 2018.Per the forward-sale agreement, the forward purchasers will borrow and sell 6,000,000 shares of common stock (or 6,900,000 shares if the underwriters fully exercise their options) to the underwriters. The company is expected to settle the agreement through delivery of shares on or before Apr 8, 2019. Alexandria will receive cash proceeds amounting to the forward sale price after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.      Issuing common stock through a forward-sale agreement offers certain benefits to the issuer and hence is a strategic fit for the company. While the company can set the price of the offering, the deal offers flexibility to delay the share issuance and receive the net proceeds, until a funding requirement has occurred.The company does not expect to receive any proceeds from the share offering, initially. Nonetheless, upon settlement of the agreement, the net proceeds will be used as growth capital and to fund Alexandria’s development pipeline. Specifically, funds will be invested in the pending near-term acquisitions and for the construction of its highly-leased projects.  Thereafter, the remaining proceeds will be held for general working expenses as well as corporate purposes. This may include shrinking unsecured senior debt obligations assumed by the company, if any.  Notably, sale of common share through this arrangement offer financial flexibility to the company as well as enables it to pursue its growth plans. These efforts will enhance the company’s portfolio and boost occupancy levels, when development projects are delivered.Encouragingly, over the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry.

40,ARE,"Retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the increased dividend on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate depicts an annualized amount of $2.55 per share versus the prior rate of $2.544 per share.Realty Income remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the January 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 570 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 48-year operating history, but also 81 consecutive quarterly increases.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Notably, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers has emerged as a pressing concern, of late, for most retail REITs. However, not all are equally facing the brunt, with some of these companies managing to book gains even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.In addition to the above, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility.The company also continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 2.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 0.3% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.

41,ARE,"Ushering in good news for shareholders, data-center REIT CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) announced a hike of 8.9% in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 98 cents per share for the fourth quarter, up from 90 cents paid in the prior quarter.It also marks a 22.5% increase from the dividend rate set in December 2016. The raised dividend will be paid on Jan 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Dec 29, 2017.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.92 a share, resulting in a yield of about 3.4%, considering CoreSite’s closing price of $115.08 on Dec 7. Moreover, the company’s dividend per share has witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% since 2011 through 2017. This reflects its continued efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth.Also, per the company’s CFO, Jeff Finnin, the company is “targeting the amount and timing” of its dividend hikes “to ensure dividend growth is closely aligned with performance and cash flow generation.”CoreSite has robust fundamentals to back dividend hikes. Per management, this data-center REIT has been chosen by more than 1,200 of the world’s leading enterprises, network operators, cloud providers, and supporting service providers for connecting, protecting and optimizing the firms’ performance-sensitive data, applications and computing workloads.In fact, the company has been a decent performer, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four trailing quarters on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, with an average positive surprise of 3.91%. CoreSite’s ROE is 15.35%, higher than the industry’s ROE of 5.78%.Also, this data-center REIT churns cash flow per share of $4.96 as compared to the industry average of $2.27. The company has witnessed decent cash flow growth in the past. Further, CoreSite has current cash flow growth of 28.23% against the industry average of 15.88%. This will likely help the company sustain its dividend payout to equity investors.  In addition, fundamentals of the data-center real estate market remains robust. Growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data-center REITs. As such, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets, and these are absorbing new construction at a faster pace despite enjoying high occupancy. Also, data-center REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book in the first 11 months of 2017, registering total returns of 30.9%.However, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry. CoreSite currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-FFO ratio of 26.2, which compares unfavorably with 16.2 witnessed by the industry. This limits the stock’s upside potential.Shares of CoreSite have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the year so far.

42,ARE,"Agree Realty Corporation’s (ADC  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a 3% sequential hike in quarterly dividends for common stock. The revised dividend now comes in at 52 cents per share versus the previous figure of 50.5 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Jan 3, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Dec 20, 2017.The cash dividend, which reflects year-over-year increase of 5.1%, is the company’s 95th consecutive dividend distribution. Agree Realty has achieved a five-year total increase of 30% in dividends since 2012. This highlights the company’s continued efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $2.08 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 4.26%, considering Agree Realty’s closing price of $48.79 on Dec 5.The company’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.59 compares favorably with 1.25 for its industry. Also, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) churns cash flow per share of $2.65 as compared to the industry average of $2.04. The company has witnessed robust cash flow growth in the past. Furthermore, Agree Realty’s current cash flow growth is significantly higher than the industry average. Secure cash flow will help the company sustain its dividend payout in the future.However, sub-optimal utilization of equity has resulted in a return on equity (ROE) of 7.27%, while the industry delivered 7.44%. Also, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry. Agree Realty currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-FFO ratio of 18.4, which compares unfavorably with 17.1 witnessed by the industry. This limits the stock’s upside potential. Year to date, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry.

Also, as of Sep 30, 2017, the funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio remained at 58%, which is a favorable level.The company also announced fourth-quarter 2017 cash dividend of 43.75 cents for its 7% Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.

45,ARE,"We will now tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle and real estate investment trust (REIT) will buzz with activity on Monday itself.Among the factors that influenced the REIT space, a sluggish yet steady macroeconomic improvement is worth mentioning. This led to strong demand for a number of asset categories in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Moreover, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases.Office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $210.9 million. This reflects a decline of 8.5% as compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is $1.50.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. Moreover, it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP. (Read more: What to Expect from Alexandria's Q3 Earnings Report?)You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of its markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.Nevertheless, AvalonBay has a solid portfolio of high quality assets in premium locations as well as a healthy balance sheet. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth and rising wages augur well for rental demand.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $2.26.However, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -5.75%. This combination leaves our prediction inconclusive. (Read more: What's in the Offing for AvalonBay in Q3 Earnings?)On the other hand, residential REIT UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) boasts vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR Inc.’s performance as it has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of the company is expected to remain limited in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of UDR Inc. is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at 47 cents.At present, UDR Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. (Read more: What's in the Offing for UDR Inc this Earnings Season?)Finally, diversified REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. In July, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $527.8 million. This reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 72 cents.At present, Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -16.7%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

46,ARE,"AlexandriaReal Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes. While the company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might decline.In the prior quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses, delivered in-line FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in one and missed in the other, with an average beat of 0.35%.Alexandria’s shares have climbed 9.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.The company follows the strategy of rotating capital from high-value assets, and the sale of non-core operating assets and non-strategic land parcels in order to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. The near-term dilution impact of such moves is anticipated to weigh on its third-quarter earnings.In addition, Alexandria’s exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries makes it susceptible to currency fluctuation risks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $2.60.Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities.

The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 3.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $17.52. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 321 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought seven self-storage facilities, comprising 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.3 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million.Finally, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (2.8 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $365 million, as well as expansion projects (1.9 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $235 million.

49,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (ARE  -  Free Report) solid asset portfolio, comprising class A properties in AAA locations, has enabled the company to enjoy high occupancy levels. While the company has been shedding non-core assets to optimize its portfolio, the near-term dilution impact of such moves on earnings cannot be bypassed.This urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) mainly focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses concentrated in urban areas. Robust demand for best-in-class office/laboratory space in this market has resulted in high-absorption rates, accelerating the company’s internal growth.Recently, Alexandria announced that it has 100% pre-leased 100 Binney Street — a ground-up development project — which will provide office/laboratory space to its tenants. The building, spanning 431,000 rentable square feet (RSF) of space, is slated to be delivered in fourth-quarter 2017.Moreover, Alexandria has delivered strong internal growth, stemming from rise in rental revenues and same-property cash NOI. The company enjoys a steady flow of rental revenues amid limited supply conditions. Also, robust external growth, in the form of development and redevelopment of new class A properties in premium locations, is likely to boost its operating performance.Subsequently, the company hiked its dividend sequentially by 4% in second-quarter 2017 and retained the same payout for the third quarter.Alexandria has a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity to sustain this payout ratio over the long run.Amid these, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. During the time frame, shares of Alexandria have gained 8.3%, while the industry rallied 7.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for third-quarter 2017 inched up 0.7% in a month’s time. Given its progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the near term.Nevertheless, there are concerns over Alexandria’s exposure to its Canadian and Asian subsidiaries, which makes the company vulnerable to currency fluctuation. In addition, the uneasiness in certain global economies remains another concern for this urban REIT.Furthermore, the company is selling non-strategic assets and non-strategic land parcels to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. The near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

This property is a ground-up development project located at the Alexandria Center at One Kendall Square campus.

The ground floor retail space will be upgraded and prominent restaurants and eateries will also be added.   Moreover, in 2006, it acquired more than one million RSF at Technology Square, which was pivotal for Alexandria Technology Square’s redevelopment.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.19.Furthermore, the company has increased total SSNOI guidance to 2.25–3% from the prior outlook of 2–3%, mainly due to better-than-expected seniors housing operating performance in the first half of 2017.Additionally, in sync with its strategic repositioning of its premier health care portfolio, the company continues to anticipate 2017 disposition proceeds to be around $2 billion.Our TakeWelltower’s diversified portfolio and strategic investments have the capability to serve as growth drivers in the long run. Also, a rise in senior citizen spending for healthcare reasons promises scope for growth. However, any rate hike remains a concern for the company due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets.

55,ARE,"We are in the heart of the Q2 earnings season and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. Notably, Jul 31 will mark the beginning of another busy week, with a deluge of earnings releases. Among others, Vornado Realty Trust , Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), Brixmor Property Group (BRX  -  Free Report) and New Residential Investment Corp. (NRZ  -  Free Report) will release their quarterly numbers on Jul 31.Admittedly, rate hike and restrained investments by investors have resulted in lower gains for the industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, a number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery. Per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate contracting 10 basis points to 7.8%.In addition, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment. Moreover, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data are also increasing demand for data center REITs. Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by encouraging demand levels.However, dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. Also, for healthcare REITs, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have put pressure on pricing in some markets.For predicting the earnings beat potential of a stock, we rely on the Zacks methodology. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a Earnings ESP ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThe Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for these four REITs set to release quarterly results on Jul 31:NY-based Vornado Realty Trust has been aggressively disposing its assets. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the earnings dilutive effects of these moves cannot be bypassed. Also, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate in its markets. Amid this, Vornado’s pricing power and occupancy gains are likely to remain limited. (Read more:Vornado Realty to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)Vornado has an Earnings ESP of +0.79%. However, it currently has a Zacks Rank #5, which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.Over the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. This is depicted in the graph below: Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuotePasadena, CA-based urban office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from its assets in high barriers to entry and exit markets, with limited supply of available space.In the second quarter too, the company is likely to enjoy high occupancy, driven by high demand for its properties in premium locations. Furthermore, it is likely to record healthy internal and external growth, solid cash flow and witness decent balance-sheet strength. However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition are expected to dent Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.

56,ARE,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (“FFO”) of $1.06 per share, which not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05, but also came higher than the year-ago quarter figure of $1.04. Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $878.8 million. It compared favorably with the year-ago number of $848.4 million.For the second quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,114 assets) climbed 1.5% year over year. By segments, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 2.0%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.4%, and medical office building portfolio rose 2.2%.Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailDuring the quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $110 million. This included $53 million of acquisitions with existing partners in its seniors housing portfolio, as well as $57 million of funding for its share of development, and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.For financing its investments, the company issued and sold 1.1 million shares of common stock, reaping net proceeds of $74 million under the “at the market” equity offering program. Further, it disposed properties and obtained final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $45 million.LiquidityPresently, the company enjoys solid liquidity with $2.6 billion of available borrowing capacity and $95 million of cash on hand.2017 OutlookVentas reaffirmed its outlook and expects 2017 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.12–$4.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17.The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 1.5–2.5% in 2017.Additionally, Ventas expects skilled nursing facilities (SNF) sale to take place in phases, starting in the third quarter, and likely to conclude by the end of this year.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Ventas in the second quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, the sale of the SNF would lower the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment. Such investments offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities. However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues remained nearly flat year over year at $1.3 billion. Although, the company witnessed improvements in RevPAR, it was marred by a decline in food and beverage revenues.Comparable RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 0.8% increase in average room rate and 70 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy to 83.2%. At its domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR inched up 1.8%. However, the same at its comparable international properties was down 3.1% on a constant-dollar basis.Nevertheless, improvements in RevPAR aided GAAP operating profit margin growth of 50 bps for the quarter.During the quarter under review, the company invested around $16 million for redevelopment, and return on investment (ROI) capital expenditures.

59,ARE,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $2.31 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56. The figure was also down 1.3% from the year-ago tally of $2.34.Quarterly revenues of $664.3 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674.2 million. Nevertheless, revenues managed to grow 4.8% from the year-ago period.Results reflect a fall in weighted-average square foot occupancy in the same-store portfolio for the reported quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported its results. Also, the company benefited from its expansion efforts.Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 3.3% year over year to $550.0 million during the second quarter, while net operating income (“NOI”) climbed 2.6% to $402.7 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $16.97. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 90 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities enhanced on the back of 292 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since Jan 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought three self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet, for $11.6 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire seven self-storage facilities, spanning 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.1 million.Finally, as of Jun 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (3.9 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $468 million, as well as expansion projects (1.7 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $191 million.

The amount will be paid on Sep 28 to shareholders of record as of Sep 13, 2017.In ConclusionWe are discouraged with the lower-than-expected performance of Public Storage in the second quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot is a positive. Notably, the company is a recognized and established name in the self-storage industry in the U.S., and its acquisition and expansion efforts look encouraging.

60,ARE,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31, after the market closes.In the prior quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with particular focus on collaborative life science and technology campuses, generated a positive surprise of 1.37% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results were backed by solid growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, with an average beat of 0.17%. This is depicted in the graph below:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company.In the to-be-reported quarter too, the company is likely to enjoy high occupancy, driven by high demand for its properties in premium locations. In addition, it is likely to record healthy internal and external growth, solid cash flow and decent balance-sheet strength. However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can adversely affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Also, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the second quarter remained unchanged at $1.50, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being overtly positive on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.50 matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Alexandria’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report), likely to release earnings on Aug 2, has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.
