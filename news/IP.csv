2,IP,"The motivations behind President Donald Trump's tariff proposals are noble. Other countries quantifiably don't have fair trade policies, and Trump wants to level the playing field for U.S. businesses.On the surface that seems like a legitimate policy to pursue. Unfortunately, tariffs won't accomplish Trump's goal — whether trade equity or just equality at the negotiation table — because tariffs don't work. When other countries subsidize their goods that is merely trade charity.What does work is innovation and economic growth. Trump should pursue policies supporting innovators. And he needs to start by working with Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's recent decision that inventions are public goods.The U.S. International Trade Commission has recently found that China is dumping products like cast iron pipe, polyester staple fiber, plastic decorative ribbon, lined-paper school supplies, and of course steel at less than fair market value.In other words — China is propping up failing industries. Without subsidies, these products would likely be priced out of competition in the U.S., yet with the subsidies Chinese products are able to sell here.However, on closer inspection the ""war"" becomes a bit murkier — as most wars are.First, China can't just manufacture money out of thin air. Their subsidies either come from taking the money out of productive sectors or devaluing their currency — which means making the money that their productive sectors make less valuable. Therefore, when U.S. companies buy these goods we are actually making China poorer. That sounds more like a trade charity than a trade war. China is increasing our quality of life by lowering their own.Thanks, China.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo, if a trade war by tariff and subsidy doesn't work, and assuming that Trump really does want to win, what should he do? He should boost American innovation. He should reward the inventors, assure us that U.S. innovations can be protected, and empower inventors to have the profit motive necessary to risk everything to pursue their ideas.The Obama administration and Congress didn't help over the past decade, and the Supreme Court dug us an even deeper hole.One of the major issues with the current system is a new administrative court, Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), that was created by the American Invents Act. PTAB has been referred to by prominent IP judges as a ""Patent Death Panel,"" and the USPTO under the Obama administration testified in court to stacking the panels against the inventors. But the Supreme Court upheld this out-of-control administrative court as constitutional as well as that patents are a public right.In his dissent Justice Gorsuch said,""After much hard work and no little investment you devise something you think truly novel. Then you endure the further cost and effort of applying for a patent, devoting maybe $30,000 and two years to that process alone. At the end of it all, the Patent Office agrees your invention is novel and issues a patent. The patent affords you exclusive rights to the fruits of your labor for two decades. But what happens if someone later emerges from the woodwork, arguing that it was all a mistake and your patent should be canceled? Can a political appointee and his administrative agents, instead of an independent judge, resolve the dispute?""The American Invents Act, which passed in 2010, was sold as a way to deal with patent ""trolls."" But the several sections that might have thwarted these bad actors were all stripped away in order to pass the bill, which merely created more barriers for inventors and defended infringers (thieves).Most people aren't aware that the innovation economy is faltering. After all, we seem to have new phone apps coming out all of the time. The problem isn't necessarily apps — although that might start changing soon as well. The problem is that the U.S. has stopped defending the inventors of the underlying innovations that these useful programs run on.In 2012 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce first produced a study that showed the U.S. was ranked No. 1 in intellectual-property protection. However, in 2017 the U.S. had slipped to No. 10, and in 2018 it fell to No. 12.Intellectual-property protections have been one of the keys to our economic success. And it is actually one of the few rights explicitly stated in the Constitution. Before our independence, inventions belonged to the King, who then meted out writs of ownership to his royal cronies. But that didn't give anyone the financial incentives needed to innovate, and our Founding Fathers knew that.But, because of the weakening of patent rights by the Obama administration, Congress and the Supreme Court, the U.S. is now slipping.Fortunately, President Trump has made several large overtures to inventors. In his attacks on China's trade subsidies, he also has mentioned IP several times in tweets. He also recently appointed a director of the USPTO, Andrei Iancu, who has expressed support for reforming the Patent Office to better serve inventors and create more assurance in the IP market.Trying to fight an economic war through tariffs isn't a winning strategy. But defending inventors, pioneers and innovators will create an army of new businesses that will lead to victory.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

3,IP,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

4,IP,"Recent days in the global Trump trade war have seen President Donald Trump go to bat to save Chinese tech jobs, while Harley-Davidson (HOG) shifts some production out of the U.S.The cognitive dissonance doesn't end there. Trump has lashed out at Canada for its high tariffs on dairy products. That's despite American dairy farmers pleading with Trump to lift steel tariffs on Mexico, or else Mexicans will cut U.S. cheese out of their diets. Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs will sap demand for its Alabama-made SUVs, while Trump threatened to hit imported German luxury cars with a 20% tax.The Trump trade war is full of contradictions that are partly a function of fighting on so many fronts. The end result looks likely to undermine U.S. interests, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs, while playing into the hands of America's top trade adversary: China.Trump wants to bend the rules of trade to get foreign manufacturers to produce goods for Americans in the U.S., attacking American companies for deciding to set up shop overseas to meet local demand. Yet Trump is shooting himself in the foot. Retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners and Trump's own tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising the cost of doing business here.Trump accused Harley-Davidson of waving the ""white flag"" after the motorcycle maker said Europe's extra 25% tariff on American-made Harleys — in retaliation for Trump's tariffs — would add about $2,200 to the cost of each motorcycle.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump argued that U.S. companies that stay strong will be rewarded when trading partners like the EU scrap their tariffs, including a 6% duty on Harleys. But companies have no reason to think Trump's strategy will work. While German carmakers are willing to give up a 10% tariff on imports, they're demanding that Trump cancel a decades-old 25% U.S. tax on imported SUVs and pickup trucks.Even when the U.S. could take the principled high ground, Trump is alienating U.S. allies and acting as if economic might makes right.Trump wasn't wrong in calling out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the country's dairy tariffs of 270%, yet the U.S. has its own sacred cows, so to speak. Overall, Canada has among the lowest tariffs in the world, even slightly lower than the U.S., according to the World Bank.Meanwhile, Trump's steel tariffs on Canada are so out of bounds that even the United Steelworkers union has called for Trump to drop the tariffs. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017. Yet, it's also the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers, importing 4.8 million metric tons. Trump tariffs ignore the latter.Harley-Davidson is hardly the only U.S. company mulling layoffs as collateral damage from the Trump trade war. Mid-Continent Nail of Missouri has reportedly laid off 60 workers and could cut hundreds more if it can't get an exemption from Trump steel tariffs that make its wares uncompetitive.Some 20,000 companies have sought exclusions. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that fewer than 100 had been processed, with 42 accepted and 56 denied. Sixteen jobs could be lost for every steel and aluminum job added thanks to tariffs, a study by the Trade Partnerships Worldwide consultancy estimated.The latest survey of regional manufacturers by the Kansas City Fed found plenty of criticism of the Trump trade war. Statements from business owners included this: ""Bracing for the worst concerning China tariffs. We will move the last of manufacturing offshore. Loss of business due to tariffs will have a larger impact than interest rates.""Trump's tariffs on Chinese high-tech-related imports, due to take effect starting July 6, would make U.S. multinationals less competitive.How? Rather than target mostly finished goods that U.S. consumers buy from Chinese companies, the Trump tariffs hit so-called intermediate goods. U.S. companies import them from China to incorporate in finished U.S. products, which then become pricier vs. rivals.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang.President Xi Jinping's Made In China 2025 agenda aims to close the technological gap and end the dependence on advanced tech from non-Chinese companies. But that's an aspiration, the researchers noted, while current Chinese tech still lags that of the U.S. and others.""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""The Semiconductor Industry Association says much the same thing: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""The chief Trump trade war target is China, which has a $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S., limits market access and systematically conspires to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.The U.S. could try to isolate Beijing by creating a broad united front to keep China honest or make it pay a price. This is what President Obama had in mind with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But four days into his term, Trump scrapped that 12-nation trade deal, which included intellectual property protections. This spring he briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that is at the root of Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump has picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.If the biggest trade threat to the U.S. is China and its world-dominating tech ambitions, why is Trump out to save 70,000 jobs at Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE?Trump decided last month to overturn Commerce Department sanctions against ZTE that banned key U.S. component suppliers from doing business with the firm, forcing it to cease operations.This week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Instead, Trump backed legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Trump could have gone as far as banning chip equipment sales to Chinese firms, Moody's said this week. That would have been a bitter pill for Xi and could have derailed trade talks.Trump appears to view America's big trade deficit as low-hanging fruit for an easy trade-war win. He largely declared victory a month ago, when China agreed to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.That may explain why the Trump trade war appears to be more diplomatic with China than with traditional U.S. allies.With no allies to join in pressuring China to change its state-subsidized technology strategy, Trump seems to be settling for low-hanging fruit. He appears to be taking a softer line on export controls, pushing the seemingly inevitable technological cold war with China down the road.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenDow Jones Futures Try To Rally: This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

5,IP,"After negotiating for nine months, the United States, Canada, and Mexico are close to finalizing a new North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In early April, President Trump predicted negotiators would agree on a slew of changes ""fairly soon.""That's encouraging news. A well-designed pact could usher in an era of fair trade and economic vitality for all three nations.To ensure the new deal benefits U.S. workers, our negotiators must insist on strong intellectual property (IP) protections for America's most innovative industries — especially the biopharmaceutical sector. If they fail to do so, they'll endanger millions of American workers' livelihoods and impede lifesaving medical research.The stakes are so high that my organization, the Conservatives for Property Rights, along with twelve other organizations, just wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Lighthizer urging him to include strong protections of U.S. IP in Nafta.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFortunately, U.S. negotiators already understand what a good deal looks like. The recently renegotiated trade deal between South Korea and the United States includes the sorts of biopharmaceutical-related concessions our negotiators must win in the new Nafta.IP protections such as patents ensure that once a drug is approved, the inventor can sell it exclusively for a set amount of time. That exclusivity gives manufacturers a chance to recoup their tremendous research and development costs. It takes $2.6 billion and up to 15 years to bring just a single drug to market.Without intellectual property protections, rivals could copy innovators' drug designs and steal the fruits of their labor. Firms would have little incentive to fund research into new therapies and treatments.U.S. trade negotiators recognize the importance of strong IP protections. In March, the United States and South Korea agreed to update their trade pact to ensure that American pharmaceutical IP is respected.The original U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 2012, included several provisions requiring the South Korean government to pay fair prices for innovative U.S. drugs.But South Korea didn't live up to its end of the bargain. The country's health officials paid domestic drug firms more for medicines than American companies.This reimbursement model ensured that state-of-the-art American drugs were sold at a price well below their fair market value. U.S. firms struggled to recoup their development costs. That weakened their desire to expand into South Korea.As a result, Korean patients enjoyed less access to groundbreaking drugs than most other advanced nations. And U.S. drug firms earned less revenue — which meant fewer job opportunities for American research and manufacturing workers.The revised agreement addresses such violations and ensures that American biopharmaceuticals are fairly valued on the Korean market.The updated deal will help to bolster America's biopharmaceutical industry, which supports more than 4.7 million jobs and contributes more than $1 trillion to our economy each year.  It will also improve Koreans' access to the latest medicines, since U.S. firms will now be eager to enter the South Korean market.U.S. trade officials should aim to build on this policy victory in the new Nafta. They can start by demanding an end to Canadian practices that artificially reduce American drug prices.Our northern neighbor's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board sets the price of brand-name drugs so it's no higher than the median price paid by seven comparator countries. The agency recently proposed adjusting that list of comparator nations. The board wants to remove wealthy countries, such as the United States and Switzerland, and add poorer countries. The change would depress drug prices even further.As with South Korea's price-control scheme, Canada's policy prevents American drug innovators from selling their inventions at a fair market price.Our trade negotiators should also insist on 12-years data exclusivity for ""biologic"" drugs, which is the standard protection in the United States. These sophisticated medicines are extremely difficult to develop. They're manufactured from living organisms  and are used to treat a variety of conditions, from cancer to rheumatoid arthritis.Data exclusivity prevents rivals from relying on the innovator company's clinical trial data to develop their own version of the drug.  It effectively gives innovators a 12-year head start on rivals. That's critical for biologics, since they're so complex and expensive to create. Without 12 years of data protection, many firms would scale back their investments in new biologic research.With the recent Korean agreement, America's trade officials have incentivized additional medical innovation and defended a crucial domestic industry — all while expanding patients' access to the state-of-the-art medicines. It's time they do the same for Nafta.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

6,IP,"Donald Trump is now deep into trade negotiations with China and NAFTA 2.0 negotiations with Canada and Mexico. We are strong free traders, but we believe that Trump's plans to negotiate better trade agreements that reduce trade barriers abroad are right on the mark. He also has to make sure those deals fully protect U.S. intellectual property, or what is commonly called know-how.American investments, ingenuity and entrepreneurship have made intellectual property one of our nation's most important assets. IP-intensive industries, including software, biotechnology and entertainment, now support nearly one-third of all U.S. jobs. But too often, our foreign trading partners take unfair advantage of our IP innovations to enrich themselves at our expense.This is glaringly evident in the pharmaceutical sector.American pharmaceutical companies are the runaway global leaders in developing new prescription drugs. This requires massive outlays of capital. A 2014 Tufts study estimated the cost of developing and bringing a prescription drug to market at $2.6 billion. These eye-popping R&D investments that U.S. pharma makes in new medications are especially important in biologics, the revolutionary class of drugs that holds great promise in addressing some of our most serious health challenges, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and more.Making those huge outlays of shareholders' money becomes harder to justify when foreign companies reap the benefits. U.S. law requires 12 years of exclusivity for new biologic medicines. In Canada, those same drugs are protected for only eight years; and Mexico, in some cases, provides no protection at all unless drug manufacturers are willing to go through an expensive legal process.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump's trade negotiators need assurances from our trading partners that these drugs and vaccines are not stolen and that American companies are paid a fair price for the lifesaving drugs they have worked to bring to market. Holding Mexico, Canada and China to the same legal standards we abide by in the U.S. would save billions of dollars — money that can be reinvested in new research to produce even more innovative treatments.There is another reason why fair pricing of U.S. pharmaceuticals must be covered by negotiated trade deals, and it is related to Donald Trump's goal of reducing the costs paid by seniors and families for drugs and vaccines here at home.It is very simple: When other nations impose price controls on American-produced prescription drugs (and threaten to steal the patents and produce the drugs themselves if these companies don't comply), it means that American consumers pay higher prices here at home to cover the R&D costs. This is unfair to American consumers. It is one reason our health care costs are higher than other nations'.So rather than imposing price controls here at home, which would severely slow the development of new lifesaving drugs, we should shut down the price controls abroad as a key condition of new trade deals.The theft of American intellectual property has been going on for years with impunity, and now it's the elephant in the room of trade deals. The United States Trade Representative estimates that the IP thievery perpetrated by China alone costs us between $225 billion and $600 billion each year. China also accounts for a major share of stolen U.S. trade secrets. That costs us another $180 billion to $540 billion annually. Millions of U.S. jobs are lost because of the unfair trade practices routinely employed by China and other countries.Intellectual property is every bit as vital to our economy — if not more so — than steel or aluminum. America leads the world in computer software; drugs; artificial intelligence; patents; trademarks; and music, entertainment and other creative industries. But how long can that last when competitor nations are ripping off our entrepreneurial companies to the tune of half a trillion dollars a year?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

9,IP,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants the federal government to guarantee a job for every American willing and able to work. The proposal sounds compassionate and enlightened, but in practice, it would almost certainly be a disaster. The fact that it's taken seriously is evidence that many Democrats, like Republicans before them, embrace loony economic agendas that are more public-relations gestures than sensible policy.Just precisely how Sanders' scheme would work is unclear, because he hasn't yet submitted detailed legislation. However, the website of the Sanders Institute favorably endorses a job-guarantee plan devised by economists at Bard College's Levy Economics Institute. This suggests how a job guarantee might function.Under their plan, anyone needing a job could get one at a uniform wage of $15 an hour, plus health insurance (probably Medicare) and other benefits (importantly: child care). When fully deployed, the program would create 15 million public-service jobs, estimate the economists. This would be huge: about five times the number of existing federal jobs (2.8 million) and triple the number of state government jobs (5 million).Although the federal government would pay the costs, the program would be administered by states, localities and nonprofit organizations, which would design jobs and enroll beneficiaries. Some jobs mentioned by the economists: cleaning up vacant properties; overseeing programs for new mothers and at-risk youths; tree planting; and weatherization of homes.To be sure, there is a real problem here. Even when reported unemployment is low — as now, at 3.9% — ""millions of Americans remain unemployed or underemployed."" They often have poor skills, wrestle with drug or alcohol problems or are so discouraged that they've dropped out of the labor force. The job guarantee's appeal is obvious. A recent Civis poll for The Nation magazine found 52% of respondents in favor.The trouble is that there is a vast gap between rhetoric and reality. Indeed, some leftish commentators recognize this. Here's Kevin Drum, a blogger for Mother Jones magazine:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Even our lefty comrades in social democratic Europe don't guarantee jobs for everyone. It would cost a fortune; it would massively disrupt the private labor market; it would almost certainly tank productivity; and it's unlikely in the extreme that the millions of workers in this program could ever be made fully competent at their jobs.""Many problems are unavoidable. The proposal would add to already-swollen federal budget deficits. The Bard economists put the annual cost at about $400 billion. Although some of this might be recaptured from savings from food stamps and other welfare programs, overall spending is likely underestimated.The reason is Medicare. If it's provided for those making $15 an hour, there will be pressures to provide it for most workers. Otherwise, uncovered workers might stage a political rebellion or switch from today's low-paying private-sector jobs to the better-paid public-service jobs, as The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip notes. The same logic applies to child-care subsidies.Then there's inflation. The extra spending and higher wages might push prices upward. The Bard economists profess to be unworried — mainly because their economic ""model"" predicts a negligible inflation effect. But models are often unreliable, and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be so complacent.Other practical problems loom. On his always-useful and strictly nonpartisan blog, Conversable Economist, Timothy Taylor poses difficult questions.Does the federal government have the managerial competence to oversee the creation of so many new jobs? Taylor is skeptical. (The 15 million added jobs would equal about one in 10 existing jobs.)Is there a skills mismatch between what the jobless can do and what actually needs doing? Probably. (Remember: the candidates for the public-sector jobs are among the least skilled workers.)Is there a similar geographic mismatch — say, the jobless are in Michigan and the jobs are in Arizona? This, too, seems probable.Can the new workers be disciplined? Good question. ""The problem with a job 'guarantee' is that you can't fire people,"" notes Taylor.Finally, would state and local governments substitute federally-funded jobs for existing jobs that are supported by local taxes? This seems inevitable. It, too, would limit the overall effect on employment.Americans are suckers for great crusades that make the world safe for the pursuit of happiness. In this context, Sanders' job guarantee seems a masterstroke. The chronically unemployed need jobs; and states and localities have large unmet needs for public and quasi-public services. It's a bargain made in heaven.Back here on earth, the collaboration looks less noble. The object is to appear good and buy political support. Many of the suggested jobs seem best described as make-work. The irony is that, by assigning government tasks likely to fail, the advocates of activist government bring government into disrepute.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:A Rebirth Of Self-Reliance?

10,IP,"Finally, some good news for the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. CNBC is reporting that a framework for a renewed and improved NAFTA may be coming in the weeks ahead.It may be now or never for modernizing and extending this trade treaty. Although NAFTA needs repair, this freer-trade agreement has been positive for all three of its nations: the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Trade across borders of our three countries is up almost 60 percent over the last two decades. More importantly, NAFTA is vital to ensuring that North America remains the economically supreme continent over Asia and Europe. North America, for example, can easily become the Middle East of oil and gas production in the first half of the 21st century.The revised agreement must be finished by the end of May for two reasons. One is that the deal needs to be voted on before the end of the year because Republicans may lose the House or Senate in November, and we know that Democrats will (figuratively) burn the place down if they take Congress -- meaning they will stymie any legislation President Trump wants.Second, Mexico has elections this summer, which could elevate a leftist government that would impede a deal on NAFTA.Trump may be willing to be flexible on some of his stands on helping U.S. automakers -- which would break the ice at the negotiating table. But he should also be firm on other issues. The White House is right to insist on better U.S. access to the Canadian and Mexican markets for manufacturing goods.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe also must insist on securing intellectual property protections in NAFTA for American innovators. IP-intensive industries (music, entertainment, software and biotechnology among them) support 45 million jobs -- nearly a third of U.S. employment -- and produce more than $7 trillion of value-added output, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.We know that the U.S. loses about half a trillion dollars of income a year due to theft of our IP products abroad. Most of that is in China, but it's a problem with Mexico and Canada, too.Technology is improving at near light speed, and governmental protections struggle mightily to keep pace. The reason we need to renegotiate NAFTA in the first place is because in just a few short decades, the pace of technology has eclipsed the standard of law.Just look at the life sciences industry, where the pace of innovation is incredibly exciting for combating life-threatening diseases.The future of personalized medicine rests largely on biologics: personally tailored drugs that work with an individual's unique biology to treat, cure and prevent disease. The work in this field is spectacularly promising and could revolutionize modern medicine with respect to cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, heart disease and Parkinson's, just to name a few.Our patents need to be honored and secured not only for economic reasons but also to encourage and accelerate the very innovation that makes this disease-free future possible. Medical innovation benefits everyone on the planet.Many of our biological patents and data collection are protected for 12 years under U.S. law.Today, Canada provides eight years of protection for biologics; Mexico in some cases provides none without costly judicial intervention. This is unfair, harmful to American companies and bad for medical progress.This is where White House Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer should be insistent in the final rounds of negotiations. Every year of protection that we cede in NAFTA sacrifices billions of dollars -- vital revenues that could be invested in research and development for new medicines and jobs in America. It is in America's economic interests to hold our NAFTA partners to the same high standard that is law in the U.S.Steve Forbes, my colleague at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, states it well: ""The U.S. should now make fair pricing of American drugs overseas a top trade priority."" Amen to that.Trump once called NAFTA the ""worst trade deal ever,"" but if he succeeds in getting a better deal for American producers and workers, he should take it.In this and other trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we need safeguards against theft and price controls of American technology and intellectual property -- which is now a multitrillion-dollar industry. Trump should use the model that worked well in the promising revamped trade deal with South Korea, which adds new and solid IP protections.What a wonderful irony it will be if Donald Trump winds up as the president who continues to promote trade deals with South Korea, China and our North American neighbors that secure freer and fairer trade to the benefit of American workers and the global economy.Other columns by Stephen Moore

11,IP,"President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which roiled the stock market less than three weeks ago, now look like a much smaller deal after big new exemptions were granted on Thursday, just before they were set to take effect.Yet dramatically shrinking metal tariffs were an afterthought on Thursday, as Trump made China the central front in his trade war and fear of retaliation against U.S. multinationals sent the stock market tumbling anew. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tumbled well over 2% Thursday on Trump's confrontational trade policy. The major averages sold off into the close on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 losing 2.1%.China is showing maximum restraint for now. Overnight, Beijing said it would impose 25% tariffs on just $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, including pork, fruit, wine, steel pipe and recycled aluminum. That compares to Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese robotics, aerospace, biopharma and other goods that could amount to about $15 billion — 25% on roughly $60 billion worth of imports. Even Trump's tariffs look modest in comparison to the $375 billion U.S. goods trade deficit with China and the $60 billion in tariffs that were floated.A day after the stock market tumble, investors initially exhibited relief Friday that the near-term consequences may be limited, but the major averages turned mixed. Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) closed up 0.4%, while Caterpillar (CAT) fell 1.8%. Both fell more than 5% on Thursday.China did not lay out any measures that would negatively affect Boeing and Caterpillar, but they could be at risk if Beijing decides to step up its retaliatory measures.China's U.S. ambassador told Bloomberg that Beijing could scale back Treasury purchases in response.Investor relief over China's measured response may be limited because Trump's tariffs to punish Beijing for intellectual property theft likely mark the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic and geopolitical relations, which can't help but pose significant risks for U.S. multinationals.Trump said Thursday that the tariffs were just the ""first of many"" actions to reduce the U.S.-China deficit. China's U.S. ambassador said that his country is ""not afraid"" to fight a trade war.The Trump administration is targeting products that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. China, for its part, is saying that U.S. accusations of IP theft are without merit.The unstated rationale of Trump's actions are pretty clear: The U.S. wants to maintain technological — and military — leadership over China, and that goal has to take precedence over economic cooperation when the two come in conflict. At the announcement of the tariffs, Trump's plan got an endorsement from Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin (LMT). Lockheed's F-35 uses stealth technology that lets it evade detection. Shares of Lockheed rose 3% on Friday.The Trump administration appears to have made a sudden realization that launching a trade war with global trading partners over steel and aluminum would hamper Washington's efforts to contain the growing threat posed by China.The 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs were set to take effect on Friday, but the Trump administration clarified late Thursday that countries representing more than half of U.S. steel imports would receive exemptions through May 1. Exempted countries include European Union members, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Australia and Argentina. After May 1, Trump could decide to permanently exempt those nations based on the status of talks.Steel stocks fell hard on Thursday after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer telegraphed the change in policy. On Thursday, shares of U.S. Steel (X) sank 11% to levels last seen before Trump ramped up his steel tariff talk in mid-February. Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell 7.5%, Nucor (NUE) 6.5% and AK Steel (AKS) 8.7%. Steel stocks extended losses Friday.The Obama administration has been a target of some criticism for an inadequate response to IP theft. Yet it did have a plan for maintaining a sphere of influence in East Asia and Southeast Asia, expanding markets for U.S. multinationals and providing stronger IP protections: the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership. Dropping out of that pact was among the first acts of Trump's presidency, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said in recent weeks that the U.S. could seek to rejoin the pact.Trump, by contrast, has been focused on bringing more U.S. intellectual property back home, through corporate tax cuts. But U.S. multinationals can't hope to serve global markets only from American shores. China, meanwhile, is laser-focused on deepening economic integration with economies throughout Asia through its 21st Century Silk Road initiative. The more the U.S. distances itself from trading partners, the easier it will be for China to emerge unscathed from a trade war.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Can You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

12,IP,"The stock market resumed sharp declines in late afternoon trade Thursday and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2%, trading practically at session lows. Boeing (BA) got hammered again, losing more than 12 points albeit in below average turnover. The number of components in the 30-stock Dow losing 2 points or more jumped to a dozen.Two of the Dow's financial components, Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), also fell sharply and both were finding minimal buying support after they undercut their 50-day moving average lines in fairly heavy volume. Bank of America (BAC), another money center bank, gapped down and dropped more than 3% while slashing through its own 50-day line.At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite dropped around 1.6% to 1.8%. Volume was running sharply higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday.Boeing, which triggered a key sell signal last week, failed in its attempt to retake its 50-day moving average. Such action increases the prospects that a deeper correction could be in the works.Fears over fresh $50 billion tariffs on China imports, and how China may retaliate, enveloped Wall Street trading desks. Losing stocks beat winners by a more than 2-1 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.Semiconductor equipment, internet content, ethical drugs, steel, air freight transport, oil drilling, coal, accident and health insurance and mortgage services also led the decline with drops of more than 2%.Semiconductors represent the fourth largest U.S. export product, and industry leaders voiced cautious support for the tariffs against certain Chinese imports in which the punitive actions are deemed appropriate. But Semiconductor Industry Association CEO John Neuffer called on the White House to take measures that protect companies' intellectual property.""U.S. semiconductor companies invest nearly one-fifth of their revenue in research and development to stay at the forefront of innovation. They should be able to compete in foreign markets without putting their critical IP at risk,"" Neuffer said in a statement. ""At the same time, we welcome China's participation in the global semiconductor value chain as long as it conforms with its international obligations and is consistent with market-based principles.""MKS Instruments (MKSI), a member of IBD's chip equipment industry group, fell more than 2.5% to 122.25 in slightly above-average trade. It's holding on to an 11% gain since breaking out of a cup with deep handle at 109.50. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 2.7% to 241.85 but turnover was quiet and the leading graphics processor firm is still trading above its 50-day moving average, a bullish sign.Both MKS and Nvidia get a spot in IBD's Sector Leaders list of top-performing companies as of Wednesday's close. Over the past six months, the Sector Leaders are up a combined 24.6%; the S&P is up 8.1%.Small caps still maintain their edge this year over large caps. The S&P SmallCap 600 faded 1.2%. The index is still up nearly 2% since Jan. 1.Defensive stocks served as one safe haven, but such stocks have not been leaders this year. The Dow utility average rallied 1.4%, but at 689 the index is still down 4.8% since Jan. 1.The S&P 500 is battling to stay near breakeven, The Nasdaq composite, at 7249 and trying to hug its rising 50-day moving average, is up 5%.JPMorgan undercut its 50-day moving average four times in quick succession during the market's early-February correction. Yet JPMorgan actually closed beneath the 50-day line just once during that period. Watch to see if the megacap money center bank can show renewed strength.On IBD Stock Checkup, JPMorgan gets a decent 83 Relative Price Strength Rating, but keep in mind that the RS Rating is less useful as a near-term selling indicator. Why? The RS Rating tracks 12 months' worth of price performance. The bank's Composite Rating is much more pedestrian at 69, but at 111.84 the stock still commands a good year-to-date gain of 4.6%.At 2657, the S&P 500 is now down roughly 0.6%  for the year. The large-cap index also now stands 7.5% below its January peak of 2872, so it's too far away from returning to a decline that fits the size of an intermediate correction.The Street currently sees JPMorgan's earnings rising 30% to $8.90 a share in 2018 and another 10% in 2019.Other money center banks also showed unsettling action.Citigroup (C) had a great January, posting new 52-week highs and rising to as high as 80.70. On Thursday, the global lender and credit card giant slid more than 2% lower to 71.46, undercutting its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year.A few top companies found in IBD's stock screens bucked the broad drop.Discount and variety chain Five Below (FIVE) ramped up more than 4% to 70.43 in volume running triple usual levels. Late Wednesday, the seller of items $5 or less posted a 31% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to $1.18 a share, narrowly edging the Thomson Reuters consensus view, and a 30% jump in sales to $504.8 million, a quarterly best.The stock has built a well-proportioned cup with handle that shows a 71.69 entry, 10 cents above the new handle's highest price.

19,IP,"General Electric (GE), an icon of American industry and the last remaining component of the original Dow Jones industrial average, now presents investors with a dilemma. At the brink of a potential breakup of the 126-year-old conglomerate, does the widely followed GE stock offer a transformational investment opportunity — or a dead end?X After years of attempts to remake the sprawling company, GE watchers aren't sure. Some say a GE breakup could unleash robust returns, but others see nothing but more damage to its already diminished value.After outlining a major slim-down in November, new GE CEO John Flannery is now open to a breakup, he revealed Jan. 16, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for it. But even breakup proponents say there's no quick fix for GE's problems. Indeed, key roadblocks, legal and otherwise, could make sticking together a better bet than a breakup for holders of GE stock.""GE cannot whittle down to three separate entities"" in power, aviation and health care, said Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch. ""Trust me, if it could, it would.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe breakup question comes as investors look for some upside to the beleaguered GE share price, which is at the lowest since December 2011. The company's status as an income stock play, a key reason to hold GE stock, was severely damaged after it halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November. (The falling stock price, though, raises GE's dividend yield.)IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend. News of a potential breakup follows a disastrous 2017 for GE stock, which tanked 45% while the Dow Jones industrial average soared 25% and fellow Dow industrials 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) jumped a respective 32% and 16%. GE's low price could even threaten its status as a Dow component. Other industrial conglomerates like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which also have also taken steps to slim down recently, saw hefty 2017 gains too.But you can't blame GE for not trying. The company is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. It has shed its stake in NBC Universal and most of one-time profit driver GE Capital, as well as its iconic lighting and appliance businesses. Former CEO Jeff Immelt sought to refocus GE on its industrial core and rebrand it as a ""digital industrial"" company, touting its efforts in software and the cloud.But that failed to arrest the decline of GE stock. Immelt stepped down as CEO in June after a 16-year tenure, and General Electric's longtime chief financial officer left in October. Soon after taking over as CEO, Flannery laid out plans in November to unload another $20 billion in assets and focus on the company's aviation, health care and power segments, which together account for most of GE's industrial revenue and profits.Yet the plan pleased almost no one, neither analysts seeking a radical restructuring of its vast asset portfolio nor investors looking for a clear path back to growth. It also left lingering concerns over the flagship power segment, which sells gas turbines and other utility equipment, where plunging profits led to 12,000 GE job cuts in December. Analysts caution that the power market is in the early stages of an extended downturn.The sale of other, smaller businesses had been telegraphed by GE, so Flannery's November announcement produced little sense of a bold vision. Then came the Jan. 16 bombshell that GE was on the hook for $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. Management acknowledged more drastic moves might be needed. GE stock ended last week with a 13% loss, marking its worst week since 2009.GE shares fell a fraction Monday ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Some analysts expect GE to slash 2018 earnings guidance again.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said on a conference call. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""For now, GE says everything is on the table, include outright sales and spinoffs. Flannery also floated the idea of staged exits, akin to the merger of GE's oil and gas division into Baker Hughes last July to form Baker Hughes a GE Company (BHGE).Other equity analysts look on GE more favorably. The conglomerate is now an asset story, and GE's well-established aerospace and health care segments would make exceptional stand-alone businesses, Scott Davis of Melius Research told IBD. Those two units alone are worth more than the entire market cap of GE, he says, while accounting for less than 40% of GE's revenue.GE Aviation is ""one of the best aerospace assets out there,"" Davis wrote in a December sum-of-the-parts analysis. He sees significant long-term value in the Leap engine and says aviation should enjoy strong services demand in the next two to three years.Here's What Fidelity Stock-Picker Will Danoff Likes Now – And What He Says About GEAnd General Electric could easily spin off its health care assets to ""unlock value"" in GE stock, similar to Siemens' upcoming IPO of its Healthineers unit, he adds.While Davis calls GE's power business severely challenged due to the rise of renewable energy, he believes it is fixable, with room for positive surprises down the road.Besides, Davis notes, the shareholder bases for GE's core businesses are completely different. For example, power holds appeal as a dividend payer and aviation as a secular growth engine.More immediately, he says Flannery should focus on cutting costs. That includes everything from general corporate expenses to its global research centers and its Predix software platform for the industrial Internet of Things. Many of these he describes as ex-CEO Immelt's ""very expensive investments that have just not panned out.""Since GE's Jan. 16 investor update, Davis has even more conviction in a GE breakup scenario.""The recent news helps confirm the fact that GE is too complex in its current form,"" he said. ""The conglomerate structure incentivizes wasteful and duplicative spending, while stifling the true earnings power of the underlying businesses.""But GE may not be able to take bold action without a feat of financial wizardry. What remains of GE Capital is saddled with $97.5 billion in debt, and the company is on the hook for more than $31 billion in underfunded pension liabilities, Deutsche Bank's Inch said in a Jan. 17 note to clients. GE is unlikely to separate aviation, power and health care into three stand-alone companies, especially since its industrial businesses backstop GE Capital's debt, he argues.""A separation of GE could carry serious ramifications in the bond market on which GE continues to heavily rely"" to fund the pension plan and operations, including the risk of litigation from GE Capital bondholders, he wrote.GE bonds also risk a rapid debt downgrade if General Electric gets rid of cash-generating businesses, which it can ill afford as a company on the hook for billions in pension obligations, he said in an interview.Other risks to GE stock loom. Inch cited billions in potential liability tied to the long-term-care insurance business, an ""inexplicably low"" tax rate that is almost certain to rise over time, a ""completely ineffective board"" that failed its duty to provide oversight and the ""very large, looming threat"" of class-action lawsuits from shareholders who may now feel misled.Before November, ""the company was adamant everything was great, the dividend was safe and secure,"" said Inch. ""I don't see how a company so large sees its earnings and dividends collapse. Somebody in the government, the SEC specifically, should be looking at what happened to get us to this point.""A GE spokeswoman said the company ""continues to work constructively with (government) agents as issues like that come up."" GE has set up a new board committee focused on capital allocation as it explores ""all options"" for its structure and portfolio, and is working through the legal and IP ramifications as part of its rigorous review, she added.For others, the math doesn't support the case for a GE breakup. A sum-of-the-parts analysis by Cowen's Gautam Khanna found GE's breakup value was 11-15 a share, below the current GE stock price near 16, after factoring in the underfunded pension and other debt-like items.""This implies that investors are currently ascribing a 'conglomerate premium' to GE's portfolio,"" Khanna said. In other words, asset sales are unlikely to add value, and a full GE breakup could even destroy value.And that doesn't account for operational synergies among the businesses that would be lost in a breakup of General Electric, he adds.Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini also points out that innovations in one GE unit can provide solutions for another. For example, a subsea drilling platform in the oil and gas segment may draw from three other units: turbines from the power segment, distribution networks from energy management and imaging technology created in the health care segment.GE's complicated portfolio makes restructuring likely to be a multiyear slog, depressing earnings growth in the near term, she says. And in the GE dividend cut, the second in a decade, she sees ""a stark reminder that even great portfolios can suffer under the weight of poor capital allocation.""CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, too, points to synergies among General Electric's core units as a reason why a complete GE breakup is unlikely. The ""core R&D"" needed to make a gas turbine or an aircraft engine is basically the same, he says. Additive manufacturing technologies, or 3D printing, also connect its diverse business.""When you build a conglomerate, you build it for a reason,"" he told IBD. ""To break (conglomerates) up just because shareholders don't like the direction of the stock, that's no way to run a business.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Did This Biotech Stock Become A Dividend Leader?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringAI In Business: What The Future HoldsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

20,IP,"Kraton (KRA) has put together the right chemistry since making its critical acquisition of Arizona Chemical two years ago.Just look at the numbers. Shares in Houston-based Kraton, a producer of specialty chemicals, have jumped nearly 90% in the past year as cost-cutting and improved margins expand earnings. Kraton's September-quarter earnings popped 140% year-over-year to $1.51 per share. Analysts estimate 120% profit growth to 64 cents in the December quarter.X Worries over the high-yield debt that Kraton added to pull off the $1.37 billion purchase of Arizona Chemical in early 2016 have faded as the outlook for free-cash-flow growth brightens, Jason Freuchtel, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told Investor's Business Daily. Plus, a strong global economy usually bodes well for chemical makers as demand grows for consumer and industrial products.""Arizona was a transformational acquisition and provided a new avenue of growth,"" Freuchtel said. ""Kraton is a value story right now. They're going to be growing free cash flow significantly over the next couple of years. They have a pretty high leverage ratio right now, so Kraton is going to be paying down debt, reducing their interest expense. And Arizona puts them in new geographies with higher margins.""Kraton's legacy petroleum-based polymer products find their way into road asphalt, roofing and shoe soles as well as disposable baby diapers, surgical gloves and rubberized grips of toothbrushes. It diversified through the Arizona Chemical acquisition. Arizona Chemical's products are derived from pine tree pulp, and are used in oilfield services, construction materials, tires and household cleaners.While company debt remains a risk, analysts say that by late 2018, Kraton may be able to refinance high-yield bonds tied to the Arizona Chemical deal, lowering interest expenses. In 2018, analysts estimate Kraton's profit will grow 28% to $3.60 per share following expected 19% growth last year.Kraton outbid several private equity firms for Arizona Chemical, which had passed through several hands on its way to Kraton. International Paper (IP) sold Arizona Chemical to buyout firm Rhone Capital in 2007. Then Rhone Capital sold Arizona Chemical to American Securities in 2010.With the purchase of Arizona Chemical, Kraton became a rival of Ingevity (NGVT), which was spun off by WestRock (WRK) in 2016. Ingevity in October agreed to buy the pine chemicals business of Georgia-Pacific for $315 million.The pricing power of both Kraton and Ingevity could improve, thanks to industry consolidation and higher energy prices that boost demand for oilfield services, Chris Kapsch, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told IBD. Kraton's management pounced on an opportunity by targeting Arizona Chemical, says Kapsch.""In this environment, with an increasingly global chemical industry, and with capital markets placing a premium on companies that have more scale, scope and liquidity, Kraton recognized that Arizona would enhance value over time. It nearly doubled the size of the company,"" Kapsch said.Kraton is no stranger to buyouts. Its roots go back to the mid-1960s when it was part of Shell Chemical. The company was spun out by Shell in 2001 and acquired by private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. JPMorgan (JPM) and TPG Capital, in turn, bought Kraton from Ripplewood in 2003.Kraton went public in late 2009 during the global recession, with the initial public offering raising $139 million. TPG and JPMorgan exited in 2011 through a secondary offering. Kraton's biggest institutional holders currently are BlackRock and Frontier Capital Management.Prior to the Arizona Chemical deal, Kraton aimed at getting bigger through a merger with Taiwan's LCY Chemical in 2014. The deal fell apart after various issues at LCY surfaced. Freuchtel says, however, that Kraton management likely would have stayed on had the merger gone through.In another move targeting the fast-growing Asian market, Kraton formed a joint venture with Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical. Kraton and Formosa opened a new manufacturing plant in May 2017 for products made from what's known as a hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer, or HSBC. The plant will make HSBC products for plastic automotive parts, medical applications and other markets.Kraton's polymer business uses raw materials butadiene, styrene and isoprene to make products for adhesives, coatings, consumer and industrial products. The pricing of those raw materials can be volatile, impacting earnings. Kraton's bottom line took a hit in the first half of 2017 from a spike in butadiene prices.HSBC products, specialty polymers, often use butadiene and are more complex to manufacture. HSBC products provide strength, flexibility or durability depending on the end-market. Kraton's specialty polymers provide the soft feel in the rubberized grips of toothbrushes or power tools; they make diapers stretchier.Lower-margin unhydrogenated styrenic block, or USBC, products use styrene and are ingredients for asphalt paving, roofing materials and footwear.Kraton's Cariflex-branded, isoprene-based rubber latex, meanwhile, has given it a strong position in allergy-resistant surgical gloves, says Freuchtel. He says Kraton has focused on markets with higher pricing, such as surgical gloves and condoms, and has reduced its reliance on commodity products, such as those used in asphalt and footwear, where it competes with larger companies such as Sinopec.Kraton's specialty HSBC business has been growing revenue at about 5% while the Cariflex business has been growing at 10% to 15%, says Freuchtel.""Their whole business plan is to really focus on expanding share with Cariflex and HSBC while still maintaining share in USBC,"" he said.Kraton has manufacturing plants in Ohio, Germany, France, Brazil and Japan. It's aiming to make manufacturing more efficient globally. The joint venture in Taiwan will help realign HSBC production, says Kapsch.After buying Arizona Chemical, Kraton aimed for $70 million in cost savings by the end of 2018 and it seems on track to deliver, analysts say.One plus for Kraton is a long-term supply deal with Arizona Chemical's former parent, International Paper, which sells Kraton raw pine material, called crude tall oil. Kraton distills various pine-based specialty chemicals from the oil.

22,IP,"For all the talk of making America great again, Americans are still at odds over the definition of ""great.""Ask some and they'll implicate the lackluster recovery of the U.S. economy, stagnant wages and broad-based economic insecurity as the enemy of America's greatness.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectivePopulist economic messages from the current administration promise a growth rate above 3%, high-paying American manufacturing jobs and a fix for trade imbalances with the rest of the world.But if we truly want to thrive for the long term in the inevitable global economy, we need to ask: What is it about America that attracts capital investment, job creation, and economic activity?My eight-year-old Kayan gets it. Like kids across America, he's obsessed with great inventors and entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates, who started and built the world's greatest tech companies from scratch. The dreams of our young innovators, and the system that instills those dreams is the secret to America's greatness.X America's system of free enterprise encourages risk-taking and breakthrough innovation by promising enormous rewards, guaranteed through the protection of intellectual property rights which are enshrined in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.When IP rights are protected, the system works – investment in innovation booms, and the economy grows with all the benefits of improved living standards that follow.Our IP system helps ensure that when our young entrepreneurs risk it all and work 120-hour weeks to realize their vision, that it won't be stolen by some big company who copies their ideas and leaves them with nothing.Our IP protection helps us foster the best and brightest talent — more than half of the top 25 engineering and technology universities are in the United States. The U.S. spends more on research & development than any country in the world. The U.S. dominates global venture capital investments in both the number of deals and investment value — nearly half of all VC dollars and deals are invested in U.S. companies.U.S. inventors hold more of the world's patents than any other country, too. As a result, the U.S. has a huge trade surplus in ""charges for the use of intellectual property"" of nearly $80 billion per year. This is nearly four times the surplus of the next closest country, Japan, and nearly twice as much as all the other countries in the world that have a surplus combined.For a country with trade deficits totaling more than a half-trillion dollars annually, IP is one of the few bright spots where we have a surplus.This shouldn't be surprising since a huge portion of our economy is reliant on intellectual property. A 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce found that IP-intensive industries accounted for nearly 40% of U.S. GDP and supported 45.5 million jobs covering 30% of all employment.The current administration seems to understand the important role of IP in global trade. In August, President Trump signed an executive memorandum kicking off an investigation into Chinese violations of trade rules related to intellectual property.The administration estimates that the U.S. IP stolen by China may be as high as $600 billion and may have resulted in the loss of tens of millions of jobs.Going after China for trade practices that disadvantage U.S. companies may be a good first step, but the much more significant problem is the weakening of the IP system right here at home.In a country whose economy and comparative advantage is directly tied to IP protection, you might think that our laws and policies would be designed to strengthen those protections. You would be wrong.Through the ironically-named America Invents Act of 2011, Congress created a system that makes it easier for patent infringers to challenge granted patents.The system is so skewed against patent owners that the chief judge of the U.S. Court tasked with hearing all appeals of patent litigation called the system ""death squads"" for ""killing property rights.""The courts have also reduced the value of American inventions by narrowing the range of technologies that can be protected by IP, making it harder to stop infringers from using stolen technology, and limiting the rewards that innovators can receive from proven infringers.Many of these steps were taken to flatten the so-called patent trolls, and they've worked: Litigation rates are way down; weak patents are regularly challenged and destroyed; and patent-holder success rates are down.Unfortunately, innovative U.S. companies are finding it increasingly difficult to defend themselves against outright copying by infringers, especially foreign competitors. We are in grave danger of burning down the house to get rid of the mice.If we want to make America great again, it's time to strengthen the U.S. patent system. We need to ensure that our most innovative companies are able to defend themselves and reap the reward of their investments in innovation.To keep the American system of innovation going, we need a strong IP system that will encourage our young innovators to dream big and pursue their boldest ambitions.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

24,IP,"Bitcoin continued to trade wildly on Thursday, a day after swelling past $11,000 and then face-planted at below $10,000, as Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the cryptocurrency doesn't meet traditional standards for money while a top Federal Reserve policymaker said Bitcoin is a ""niche product.""X The digital currency, ever sensitive to price swings and the emotions of big and small investors alike, was down 2.8% to $9,540.14 in afternoon trading after sinking to $9,021 intraday. Etherium, another cryptocurrency, was down 2.4% to $427.51, but off their worst levels too.Last week, Bitcoin hovered in the $8,000 range. The latest big price swings come as more smaller, less sophisticated investors, curious about the hype, hop aboard and then bail on what has become a wild ride this year for the cryptocurrency.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday that it's too soon for his bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, and questioned calling the digital instrument a ""currency.""""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankefein told Bloomberg Television.Goldman's commodity chief said Wednesday that Bitcoin should be treated as a commodity.Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said Thursday dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could be a major rival to established currencies or that the Fed itself would issue its own cryptocurrency.""Digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines,"" Quarles said.

29,IP,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

30,IP,"Sarepta Therapeutics' (SPRT) high-priced treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy could garner some M&A attention, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Wednesday, estimating more than $1 billion in potential sales for the drug despite lingering insurance concerns.Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Exondys (eteplirsen) 51 to treat DMD, a rare form of muscular dystrophy that affects fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. each year. Sarepta says the drug will cost $300,000 annually per patient, based on weight.That price tag could have insurers dragging their feet, but three neurologists told RBC they plan to begin prescribing Exondys 51 to all eligible patients. Younger patients are likely to experience more benefit ""given the opportunity to preserve muscle function,"" Simeonidis said in a research note.It will likely take one to three months to kick off treatment, and one to two years to see the benefit, the neurologists said. Though determining benefit will be difficult, the neurologists said they'd be unlikely to stop treatment unless safety concerns arose.""One doc used the analogy of treating someone with high blood pressure, saying there is rarely a point at which you stop treatment,"" Simeonidis said.Simeonidis expects a successful launch once the logistics of reimbursements are ironed out over two to three quarters.""Given the product's broad label, its apparent safety (thus far) and the understandable urgency of the DMD patient community to gain immediate access to this agent, we don't expect reimbursement to end up being a significant issue,"" he wrote.The neurologists added insurers are unlikely to balk at the price in the long run.""Insurance companies 'don't want the negative headlines associated with denying coverage,'"" Simeonidis wrote that one neurologist said. ""Another doc added that the DMD patient community is 'very vocal and will likely push back themselves if faced with reimbursement issues.' ""Simeonidis boosted his price target on Sarepta stock to 108 from 83 and kept his outperform rating.The major price target rise is conservative, he said, arguing in the worst case Sarepta's IP litigation with Biomarin (BMRN) over Exondys 51 and SRP-4053 (another DMD treatment) could result in as high as a 10% royalty in the U.S. and EU. But that's unlikely, he said. Other geographies offer more upside.Exondys 51 is likely to gain attention, too, in the M&A world, ""especially for biopharmas looking for commercial assets in the orphan disease space."" Exondys 51's potential $1 billion-topping sales estimate and Sarepta $3 billion valuation have transformed Sarepta into an attractive acquisition candidate, he said.On the stock market today, Sarepta stock lifted 5.3%, to 62.24, and at a 14-year high.IBD'S TAKE: Big Pharma M&A fodder is pushing IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group which is ranked No. 5 out of 197 groups tracked.

31,IP,"Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is sitting pretty ahead of the release of the latest game in its lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey on Wednesday raised his price target on Activision stock to 49.79 from 45.56 and reiterated his buy rating.Activision stock early Wednesday touched a record high of 44.89 before closing up 1.2% at 44.67 on the stock market today. The stock is in buy range from the 43.15 buy point of a flat base but investors should be careful about buying with the market uptrend under pressure.Key performance drivers for Activision's fiscal Q3 include ""World of Warcraft: Legion,"" ""Destiny"" and catalog and digital game sales, Hickey said in a research report Wednesday. Activision's Q4 will be driven by ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"" due out Nov. 4, and ""Skylanders Imaginators,"" due out Oct. 16, he said.""We view the company's risk-reward (profile) as positive,"" Hickey said. ""We remain bullish on the current-gen console market and suspect upcoming consoles launches (will be) an incremental growth opportunity. The executive team is strong and determined to drive growth; guidance is generally conservative.""IBD'S TAKE: The current video game console cycle and the shift to digital game downloads are helping game publishers in general. But Activision is the top-ranked company in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. Activision also is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz on Tuesday reiterated his buy rating on Activision with a price target of 55.""In the next 10 years, Activision wants to be the Disney (DIS) of the 21st century (but with higher profit margins),"" Pitz said in a report. ""Like Disney, ATVI develops and monetizes its deep portfolio of (intellectual property) through a variety of media channels.""Unlike Disney, Activision has a direct 1-1 relationship with its consumers, has a more deeply engaged audience, and has a younger and growing global audience. And where Disney's ESPN pays billions to acquire rights for various sports, Activision owns its IP, which it believes is an advantage as it builds its new eSports business.""IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group ranks No. 9 out of 197 groups. Other top companies in the sector include Electronic Arts (EA) as well as Chinese video game distributor and Activision partner NetEase (NTES).RELATED:Electronic Arts Gets Price-Target Hikes As 'Battlefield 1' Nears

33,IP,"Ambarella (AMBA) stock fell Friday as its better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter still disappointed analysts in some areas, and it didn't rid analysts of fears that the holidays could disappoint, with the company partly counting on success with the newest GoPro (GRPO) action camera, the Hero 5.""While the outlook for drone sell-in was a bit disappointing, we think management is being conservative; we could still see upside depending on demand,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson wrote in a research note late Thursday. He maintained his overweight rating on Ambarella stock and 75 price target.But Erickson also said that the company's October-quarter guidance disappointed in that ""we were looking for drones to be up quarter to quarter, vs. management's commentary of flat.""Ambarella makes video-compression and other types of chips used not only in GoPro action cameras and the emerging field of drones, but also in internet-based security cameras, automobiles and elsewhere.Consumer markets are approaching half of Ambarella's sales, Erickson said, ""so holiday sell-through is the key determinant for AMBA moving forward. If drone or GoPro sell-through is better than expected, upside to our (price) target is likely. We think drones in particular are set up to drive potential upside for AMBA.""But there's also downside should drones and the new Hero disappoint this holiday, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton said in his Friday research report, in which he maintained a hold rating on Ambarella stock.""Despite the positives, we see risk should sell-through of the strong holiday build prove weaker than expected,"" Bolton wrote.But Bolton also said he saw ""continued strength in drones and home security cameras offsetting expected weakness in wearable cameras"" and that the company's guidance reflected a ""strong holiday build for GoPro's new Hero5 camera and home security cameras, as well as a recovery in IP security cameras in China.""Bolton said Ambarella is increasing its share of the drone market, but wrote that as the market for video-processing technology rises, Ambarella could face increased pressure from some of the largest chipmakers, naming Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC).Ambarella posted a 39% year-over-year decline in EPS ex items for the quarter ended July 31, and a 23% decline in revenue, yet both measures beat Wall Street estimates. EPS, in fact, crushed estimates by 16 cents. Ambarella's current-quarter guidance also beat expectations, though the company expects its non-GAAP gross profit margin to slip this quarter vs. Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Ambarella is a favorite of institutional investors at the moment.

35,IP,"In the pantheon of cloud computing, consider Amazon Web Services the Zeus-like leader, with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM) also ranking among the top service providers.Not found in the cloud hierarchy, however, are telecom companies AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and CenturyLink (CTL).While telecom leaders in other markets have surfaced as cloud-computing services leaders, that's not so in the U.S. -- not that AT&T, Verzon and CenturyLink didn't try.But they failed, and observers point to cloud vendors ramping up security faster than the telecoms expected, outspending the telecom firms in key areas and being quicker to help app developers.For telecom firms, their chances for cloud dominance are gone, as the kingpins scale up, says Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research.""At this point, it's over for anyone to break into a competitive, global, hyper-scale mega-cloud with the scale and feature-breadth of AWS, Microsoft, Google and IBM,"" Bartoletti said.AWS, part of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), battle for supremacy along with Microsoft's Azure and Google in what's called infrastructure-as-a-service. IaaS is the fast-growing business of renting out computing resources -- number-crunching machines, data storage and software tools -- to companies and other enterprises.IBD'S TAKE: Make no mistake, despite its huge growth in e-commerce, Amazon's AWS cloud business has become another huge growth driver for the company, boosting its outlook and helping it take up residence among the select IBD Leaderboard companies. IBD scans all of our proprietary data to find stocks with the most potential for big gains, and only those companies make Leaderboard.There's room in the cloud assemblage for data center operators and co-location companies such as Equinix (EQIX). The Redwood City, Calif.-based company provides space, power lines, cooling and access to high-speed internet connections. Customers bring their own computer servers. Equinix runs data centers globally for corporate customers, including internet companies like Facebook (FB), as well as the IaaS players such as Amazon.In the data center part of the cloud field, too, telecom firms have come up short.Yet Japan's leading fixed-line telecom NTT (NTT) and Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) have made inroads in cloud services, says Camille Mendler, an analyst at U.K.-based research firm Ovum.""NTT has built and acquired vast global data center assets as part of a wider strategy to become a digital services provider,"" Mendler said. ""NTT is doing this not just in the developed economies of North America and Western Europe, but also in emerging markets.""U.S. telecom firms had their own aspirations. Verizon acquired cloud service firm Terremark in 2011 for $1.4 billion, while CenturyLink that same year acquired another cloud services/data center company, Savvis, for $2.5 billion. But both Verizon and CenturyLink have put their data center operations up for sale, and AT&T is said to be looking to sell its data centers as well.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said last month that the telecom firm is close to decisions on its data centers. The Verizon data center assets that are widely considered to be the most desirable are in Miami and Culpeper, Va., near Washington, D.C. Observers say demand might be tepid, however, for much of the former Terremark assets.Analysts say Verizon's data centers might attract interest from private equity firms, but probably not from AWS, Microsoft or Google. The technologies and approaches don't mesh well.CenturyLink, meanwhile, is expected to announce a deal by year-end. And according to analysts, AT&T's 35 data centers also have been ""available"" at an asking price of around $2 billion. It's unclear if there's been any interest.The telecom firms might be unable to find a single buyer who wants all their data center assets and might instead be forced to sell them off separately, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said in a research report.Equinix has expressed an interest in some of these data center assets.Cloud services have a stormy history with telecom firms.AT&T acquired USinternetworking, a co-location provider, in 2006 for $300 million, but it missed a chance to take the next step and buy its way into the cloud when IBM gobbled up Softlayer for $2 billion in 2013. Instead of buying Softlayer, AT&T a year later settled for a consolation prize -- a marketing partnership with Softlayer.""IBM is a player in the public cloud market only because of their Softlayer acquisition,"" Bartoletti said. After buying Softlayer, IBM spent billions to build more data centers.Both Verizon's Terremark and CenturyLink's Savvis had sizable web hosting businesses when acquired. With the acquisitions, Verizon and CenturyLink aimed to be bigger players in the co-location business and the public cloud, where customers rent computing resources via the internet.Verizon in 2011 bought CloudSwitch, whose technology makes it easier for companies to run business applications in the public cloud. Verizon built up a cloud IaaS offering using technology from VMware (VMW). In February, though, Verizon shut down its public cloud services, crushed by AWS and Microsoft's Azure.Verizon and AT&T, analysts say, aimed to set themselves apart by packaging their cloud services with private internet networks, security, data storage and service guarantees. AT&T's Synaptic compute-as-a-service business combined virtual private networking and enterprise-class cloud services, rivaling that of AWS. AT&T also sells cloud data storage services, mainly to government agencies.Many corporations were at first leery of the public cloud because of security concerns, but more are now shifting even their most important workloads to the public cloud offerings from AWS and Microsoft's Azure. ""I think the telcos were caught by surprise as security in the public cloud dramatically improved,"" said Forrester's Bartoletti.As public cloud security worries ease, Verizon and AT&T have one less argument to make with potential customers, analysts say.""The market changed,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink haven't provided tools to help software developers create new apps and services in the cloud, she says.""It's not an asset game. You need capital to compete, but it's not just about data centers,"" Leong said. ""Verizon tried to build the next-generation cloud with CloudSwitch, but that project failed.""AT&T and Verizon aren't the only ones to struggle vs. Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Shares of Rackspace Hosting (RAX) have plunged. Rackspace put itself on the market in 2014 before pulling itself off the market. But early Friday, Rackspace announced an agreement to be acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) for $32 a share, or $4.3 billion, and the company will go private. Rather than compete in IaaS, Rackspace has shifted to providing support services for AWS and other cloud computing providers.The telecom firms may have underinvested to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google, whose capital spending on warehouse-sized data centers has soared. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are among the few firms that are bigger -- their market caps are $100 billion or more larger -- than even telecom leaders AT&T and Verizon.If that's the case, then it's not a mistake for Verizon to want to repeat in digital media and advertising. After acquiring AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion, Verizon has doubled-down by agreeing to purchase Yahoo (YHOO) for $4.8 billion. Verizon has made other digital media acquisitions as well.Gartner's Leong says it's not only the millions of computer servers packed into data centers that sets Amazon apart.""The IaaS market rewards intellectual property and the ability to leverage software developers,"" she said. ""Carriers are capital assets companies, they're not IP companies. Amazon has invested enormously in software, automation and engineering.""Amazon stock finished Monday trading up 0.3% to 771.29 on the stock market today. Alphabet gained 0.3% to 795.82 while Microsoft edged up 7 cents to 58.10. Verizon added 0.8% to 52.50 as AT&T climbed 0.8% to 41.RELATED:How Amazon, Microsoft Can Unlock Small-Business Market For SaaSRackspace Accepts $4.3 Billion Buyout From Apollo Global

36,IP,"Intel (INTC) has a $1 billion incremental data center opportunity, though will likely face stout competition in virtual reality, autonomous driving and the Internet of Things from rivals such as NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM), a Canaccord analyst said Friday.Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay reiterated his buy rating and 40 price target on Intel stock following the annual Intel Developer Forum this week in San Francisco. There, Intel unveiled a partnership with ARM Holdings (ARMH) and a ""merged reality"" headset.On the stock market today, Intel shares rose 0.8% to 35.24. Shares are up 1.9% for the week. Intel has been trading sideways since its earnings report a month ago.Ramsay keyed in on two themes following the three-day event that ended Thursday. Intel continues to diversify across its varying segments, and CEO Brian Krzanich is demonstrating a ""relatively new sense of market pragmatism,"" he wrote in a research report.Ramsay noted Intel's licensing agreement with British Apple (AAPL) supplier (and longtime rival) ARM Holdings which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank (SFTBY). Intel will make some of ARM's chips for mobile and IoT.""The newly announced ARM physical IP license deal is a prime example of this pragmatism,"" he wrote. ""(It's) hard to imagine such a deal from Intel five years ago.""Competitors like Qualcomm, NXP and Nvidia have early leads in virtual reality, autonomous driving and IoT, Ramsay acknowledged. But innovations across Intel's varied product lines should drive double-digit growth in its data center unit.IBD'S TAKE: Intel isn't alone is reaping the benefits from its Apple exposure.  Applied Materials stock rocketed to a 16-year high Friday on its consensus-busting fiscal Q4 guidance. The maker of chip gear sees its OLED exposure being three times that of traditional LCD.There, Ramsay sees a $1 billion incremental opportunity — the same potential he sees for Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) which can be used to handle high-performance computing workloads.But Intel's Knights Landing central processing unit (CPU) is also used to train machines.And Intel has already made a big foray into supplying the Super 7 — Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY), he said. Those seven have huge high-performance computing needs.""We believe the data center accelerator market will be quite fragmented in the long term,"" he wrote. ""And the competitive debate between Nvidia and Intel is both overhyped and oversimplified by investors relative to each company's financial fundamentals.""Related:SoftBank 'Crazy Idea' Beats Intel To Punch On Apple Supplier ARMIntel Developer Forum Spotlights Apple-, Google-, Tesla-Rivaling Segments

37,IP,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is sidling up to Apple (AAPL) and the burgeoning Internet of Things market via a partnership with longtime rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) to manufacture some of its chips, the companies said Tuesday.The partnership was announced at the Intel Developer Conference in San Francisco. It gives Intel a stronger foothold in the ""mobile, IoT and other consumer"" markets as the longtime top maker of PC chips shifts course to growth markets.IBD'S TAKE: ARM is set to be acquired by SoftBank in a $32 billion deal. But analysts posited in July that Intel could have swooped in to buy ARM before SoftBank in an attempt to buy its way into the hard-won mobile market.Intel is essentially becoming a foundry manufacturer for ARM's partners. There, it will compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung for business from key customers such as Apple and Qualcomm (QCOM).Specifically, ARM is licensing its Artisan platform for complex systems-on-a-chip and processor technology to Intel for use on its 10-nanometer process, said Zane Ball, vice president for technology and manufacturing group and co-general manager of Intel Custom Foundry, in the announcement.""Foundry customers can take advantage of the IP to achieve best in class power, performance area for power-efficient, high-performance implementations of their designs for mobile, IoT and other consumer applications,"" Zane said in a company blog post.Combining ARM's processor and physical design with Intel's integrated device manufacturing will allow for quicker knowledge transfer and lower risk, said Will Abbey, general manager for ARM's physical design group, in the announcement. He called the collaboration ""tremendous.""The initial yield will be for two processor cores for mobile or stand-alone apps, Abbey said.Zane also announced that Intel had won business from LG Electronics. LG will use Intel's 10-nm process to produce a ""world-class mobile platform,"" he said.The mobile business is important to Intel which, in April, announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs and a restructuring amid sloping PC sales.Rumors have circled over for months suggesting that Apple tapped Intel to source some of its iPhone 7 modems. Partnering with ARM puts Intel one step closer to that coveted business. Apple's iPhone and iPad chips are based on ARM's architecture.On the stock market today, Intel fell 0.5% to 35.02. Shares are up 2% for the year.Meanwhile, IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group has climbed to No. 35 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 169 13 weeks ago.

38,IP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and Synopsys (SNPS) are among the best positioned hardware and software companies for growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) -- industrial, medical, automotive and consumer devices connected wirelessly to the Web -- says RBC Capital in a research report.Companies targeting IoT growth have stepped up acquisitions, wrote RBC analyst Mitch Steves.Cisco in March acquired Jasper, an IoT software provider, for $1.4 billion. Intel in April bought Arynga, which provides wireless software to update automotive IoT systems. Japan-based telecom conglomerate SoftBank (SFTBY) in July said it would buy chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH) for $32 billion.IBD'S TAKE: EPS is the biggest red flag for Cisco Systems, as investors can learn from IBD Stock Checkup.""While ARM (acquired by SoftBank) was the leading player in semiconductor intellectual property, Synopsys is second with 15% of revenue tied to IP -- benefiting from complex chip design and miniaturization,"" said Steves.Web-connected devices are expected to transform factory automation, agriculture, utilities, health care, retail and insurance industries. Amazon.com's (AMZN) cloud computing service, General Electric (GE) and phone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) are among those targeting IoT markets.""We think the software platform is the most attractive segment within the broad topic of IoT, as cloud-based software platforms allow companies to obtain real-time visibility and monitoring,"" said Steves. ""For the design side, we think companies that provide software to create increasingly complex chips (miniaturization) will also benefit from IoT growth.""He says Big Data firms Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) should have upside from IoT deployments.On Intel, he said: ""INTC is on track to generate $2.5 billion of revenues from its IoT segment, implying year-over-year growth of 10%."" Intel could update its IoT efforts at its Intel Developer Conference, which starts Tuesday, in San Francisco.With Jasper, Cisco gained software to manage wireless connections to a broad range of devices, Steves said.""Cisco now offers comprehensive end-to-end IoT solutions across a number of industry verticals, making it a preferred choice for businesses that function across multiple industry sectors,"" he wrote.Intel stock finished trading up 1% to 34.91 on the stock market today.

Last year, chip sector M&A hit a fever pitch as deals topped $100 billion, including Intel's $16.7 billion Altera buy and Broadcom's $37 billion merger with Avago Technologies.""With structurally slowing supply, rising barriers to entry, consolidation and a mix shift in end demand away from consumer, we continue to see scarcity value in semiconductor IP and assets and except M&A to continue to be a prevalent theme,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report.Hettenbach places Analog Devices among the company of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) as ""playing acquirers who can deliver above average (earnings per share) due to synergies.""But unlike most recent chip M&A, Analog Devices' move to acquire Linear is largely a technology play, he says.Analog Devices leads the data converter market with 40%-50% share, double that of closest rival Texas Instruments (TXN), though that company will remain much larger than the combined Analog Devices-Linear.Linear, meanwhile, is No. 3 in power management chips.""One of the long-standing knocks on Analog Devices was its lack of power management presence, the fastest-growing segment within analog,"" Hettenbach wrote in a report. ""But the Linear deal would clearly change this.""IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 60, meaning it performs in the top half of stocks in terms of key metrics. But it trails Linear stock, which has a CR of 79. Texas Instruments stock, though, leads the group with a CR of 96.Together, Analog Devices and Linear are expected to bring in $5 billion in annual sales, nearly 11% of the total $45.7 billion analog-chip market, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tore Svanberg wrote in a report. The companies see $150 million in cost savings from their merger.Hettenbach expects those savings to yield $4.45 EPS ex items in 2018. Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan sees $5 EPS ex items by the end of 2020.The acquisition cuts Analog Devices' Apple exposure by a third, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote in a report. Schafer downgraded Analog Devices in December on its growing exposure to ""the inherent volatility"" associated with Apple.The Linear deal trims Analog Devices' consumer segment to 12% of sales, Schafer says.Non-consumer end markets industrial, automotive and communications have been key to Analog Devices' economic recovery over the past five years, Stifel Nicolaus' Svanberg said.After the acquisition closes, expected in mid-2017, those segments will comprise 82% of total sales, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.Morgan Stanley's Hettenbach upgraded Analog Devices stock to overweight and boosted his price target to 78 from 56.Svanberg rates Analog Devices stock a buy, and he upped his price target to 78 from 68. Oppenheimer's Schafer has an outperform rating and 80 price target on Analog Devices stock.At the close on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares ended the day up 0.7% to close at 63.33.

41,IP,"As large companies move to IP (internet protocol) communications, 8x8 (EGHT) can win share vs. bigger rivals such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Avaya and Verizon Communications (VZ), says Summit Redstone Partners, which initiated coverage on 8x8 with a buy rating.Besides Cisco and Verizon, 8x8 also competes with RingCentral (RNG) and Interactive Intelligence (ININ).Analyst Jonathan Kees set a price target of 17 on 8x8 stock, which is up more than 20% in 2016 so far. The stock finished 3.4% higher at 14.61 in the stock market today. 8X8 stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 12.05 buy point on May 18, and it is now 20% extended. IBD's Telecom-Services Integrated group ranks No. 32 out of 197 industry groups.8x8 reported fiscal Q4 revenue growth of 32% to $57.3 million, topping estimates.

42,IP,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will breeze through the PC doldrums thanks to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, but rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) three quarters of better-than-expected sales will likely ""crack,"" forcing shares to tumble from four-year highs, analysts said Friday.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended the day up 2.4% to 34, while Advanced Micro Devices stock was up 1.6%, to 5.10. The companies are set to report Q2 earnings on July 20 and July 21, respectively.Intel stock broke out a flat base at a 32.79 buy point on June 23, so it remains within buy range.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani upped his price target on Intel stock to 34 from 33, noting that slightly stronger PC demand and tailwind from Apple's iPhone 7 ramp should provide upside to Intel's fiscal Q2 client computing group (CCG) sales.Intel reportedly will supply a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM). That could add $300 million to $500 million in incremental sales in the second half of 2016, Daryanani wrote.That will partially offset an expected 7% decline in PC sales in 2016. Intel is the longtime leader in sales of computer microprocessors. It's had a hard time cracking the mobile market, however, so the iPhone 7 win could be big for the company.Daryanani models $30.2 billion in 2016 CCG sales, declining 6.3% but topping a 7.6% fall in 2015. He said Intel's view for accelerating data center sales is likely ""aggressive.""Still, there's near-term strength in PCs. On Thursday, Western Digital (WDC) upped its fiscal Q4 guidance following its acquisition of SanDisk.Notebook shipments climbed 28% month over month to 9.2 million units in May, according to device makers, Daryanani wrote.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is less bullish on Intel stock, but boosted his price target to 33 from 26 and upgraded shares to market perform from underperform. He downgraded AMD stock to underperform from market perform and kept his 3 price target.Like Daryanani, Rasgon sees Apple-centric sales boosting Intel's near-term revenue. For Q2, he models $13.6 billion in total sales vs. Wall Street consensus views for $13.5 billion. His Q3 model for $14.6 billion in total sales is largely in line with broader expectations.AMD, on the other hand, is ""more controversial,"" he wrote in a research report. After AMD's Q1 upside surprise, shares rocketed on hopes that share gains vs. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) can hold, that new products might sustain upside and that IP deals may follow.Those hopes are unfounded, Rasgon says. AMD's Q1 upside was likely on channel fill and its semi-custom win was on a console. Also, AMD's Zen product likely won't ramp materially in servers for a year, he says.He wrote that ""we suspect downside over the next few quarters is likely, and when it cracks it tends to do it rapidly.""

The assets include over 500 issued and pending patents around the world. The purchase price was about $96 million.""We are pleased to enhance our extensive key patents in phosphorescent materials with BASF's complementary OLED IP portfolio,"" Universal Display CEO Steven Abramson said in a statement. ""One of our key objectives is to develop and deliver an all-phosphorescent emissive stack. We believe that this acquisition will help further these research efforts, principally in the development of commercial blue emissive systems.""Universal Display is a leading supplier of OLED materials and technology. Its customers include Samsung, AU Optronics (AUO) and LG Display (LPL).Last Thursday, Universal Display announced an agreement to acquire Adesis, a privately held contract research organization in New Castle, Del. Adesis specializes in organic and organometallic synthetic research, development and commercialization.Universal Display is paying about $36 million in cash for Adesis.""This acquisition is part of our strategic growth plan,"" Abramson said in a separate press release. ""We believe that it will provide additional highly skilled resources to further advance our initiatives for the development and delivery of next-generation proprietary emissive material systems in the rapidly evolving OLED industry.""Needham analyst James Ricchiuti said the two deals will strengthen Universal Display's business, as the mobile phone industry accelerates adoption of OLED displays. Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be using an OLED display in its 2017 model iPhone.""We regard the acquisitions as a good use of UDC's cash that could erect additional barriers against competitors as OLED displays gain broader adoption,"" Ricchiuti said.Ricchiuti rates Universal Display stock as buy with a price target of 69. Universal Display stock closed up 1% at 66.19 on the stock market today. Its shares reached a record high of 71.46 on June 9, and it sports a strong Relative Price Strength Rating of 96, meaning it's performed among the top 4% of all stocks in the past 12 months.RELATED:Anticipation: Apple iPhone 8 Could Rain On Upcoming iPhone 7 ParadeLikely Apple OLED Display Supplier Gets Cautious Report.

44,IP,"Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) hit new video game ""Overwatch"" is likely more profitable than many investors think, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a research report Thursday.Despite all of the news about ""Overwatch"" being a huge seller since its May 24 release, consensus EPS estimates for the second quarter look conservative, Wilson said.""Overwatch,"" a science-fiction shooter game, probably will make up 21% of Activision's Q2 revenue, he said. Wilson estimates the game has a contribution profit margin of at least 65%.""It has a quadfecta ('Diablo 3' joke) of favorable margin factors: (1) it is strongly PC-skewed, (2) it has a high digital download rate, (3) it comes with low capitalized software development costs and (4) it is an owned-IP,"" Wilson said. ""Each of these factors could contribute to higher profitability than a normal release, which we still don't think is fully factored into sell-side models.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Activision to earn 41 cents a share minus items on sales of $1.43 billion. That would represent year-over-year growth of 215% in non-GAAP earnings per share and 88% in sales.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), EPS is forecast to be 32 cents, up 10% year over year.Wilson estimates Activision will post non-GAAP earnings per share of 46 cents in Q2, 5 cents ahead of Wall Street consensus.He also estimates Activision will sell 7 million units of ""Overwatch"" in Q2. But with the number of registered players worldwide at over 10 million, he sees the potential for upside.He rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 43.

45,IP,"With the Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, drawing to a close in Los Angeles, Wall Street analysts are chiming in with their thoughts on which publicly traded companies performed the best at the annual trade show and which came up short.Several analysts proclaimed ""Battlefield 1,"" a World War I combat game from Electronic Arts (EA), as the title with the most positive buzz at E3.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said “Battlefield 1” stole the show. He also was impressed with EA's sci-fi action game ""Titanfall 2.""""Given the initial positive feedback on 'Battlefield 1,' coupled with improved 'Titanfall 2' functionality (now includes single-player campaign), we believe management's current guidance could prove overly conservative,"" Sebastian said in a research report. He rates EA stock as outperform, with a price target of 80. EA rose 0.8% to 75 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) overcame negative pre-show buzz for its game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and won over some skeptics.“Before E3, many investors were concerned about the negative reception for (Activision's) ‘Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’ trailer,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a report. “However, we think CoD showed better this week.”Wilson rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 43. Activision climbed 1.8% to 39.03 on Thursday.Still ""Infinite Warfare"" faces ""stiff competition"" from ""Battlefield 1,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report. “Infinite Warfare” is set for release on Nov. 4, following two big EA titles. “Battlefield 1” comes out on Oct. 21 and “Titanfall 2” drops on Oct. 28.The highlight for Activision at E3 came not from the show floor, but from an upbeat report about its recently launched sci-fi shooter game ""Overwatch."" Activision announced during the show that it has over 10 million users for ""Overwatch"" worldwide since the game's release on May 24.Baird's Sebastian raised his price target on Activision stock to 43 from 42 on Thursday based on the ""Overwatch"" news. He maintained his outperform rating on the stock.“While users will likely exceed unit sell-through due to time-based usage in Asia and disc-sharing, we now expect material upside to our original 6 million unit expectation,” he said. “As such, we are increasing our Q2 fiscal 2016 estimates to reflect 8.5 million unit sales.”What’s more, his firm’s checks in China suggest that “Overwatch” is taking significant share from Tencent’s (TCEHY) “League of Legends,” at least temporarily, Sebastian said.On the downside, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) disappointed analysts and fans at E3 by not announcing any big new titles.“The Street’s biggest takeaway from Take-Two’s E3 2016 will be the lack of an announcement for the next ‘Red Dead’ (or any other new IP), despite a strong showing for ‘Mafia 3’ and ‘Civilization 6’ at the event,” Piper's Olson said. “‘Mafia 3’ in particular could be the critical cog for the company to reach its internal goals. However, little was discussed related to ‘Borderlands,’ ‘Red Dead’ or any other new IP, which is the primary focus of most investors.”Here's our interview with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick from E3.Olson rates Take-Two stock as overweight with a price target of 40. Take-Two rose 0.7% to 37.77 on Thursday.Pacific Crest's Wilson called Take-Two's game slate this year ""uninspired.""Another letdown at E3 was the lack of major AAA game titles for new virtual-reality headsets from Sony (SNE), HTC and Facebook's (FB) Oculus.The major game publishers are unwilling to devote resources to VR games until the installed base of headsets makes the market opportunity worthwhile, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a report.“From a publisher perspective, VR looks more like a 2018 story (at the) earliest,” Pitz said. “Every management team we spoke with had the same two concerns about VR. First, what kind of games will succeed on VR? Second, how long will gamers be willing to wear the headsets?”The three-day E3 conference officially opened Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but several large companies held pre-show events.RELATED:‘Clash Of Clans’ Game Maker Possible $9 Billion Takeover TargetElectronic Arts Impresses At E3; Why Take-Two’s Stock Sold OffWedbush’s Pachter On The ‘Conspiracy Theory’ Behind EA’s E3 Snub

For 2019, NXP cut its forecast for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) minus items to $3.7 billion from $4 billion, but it retained its view for long-term 15% growth in earnings per share ex items growth.NXP shares traded up and down Tuesday, closing 3 cents lower at 87.37 on the stock market today. Late Monday, the company announced that Beijing Jianguang Asset Management and Wise Road Capital would buy its Standard Products division.Under the deal, about 11,000 NXP employees will be transferred to Nexperia. Nexperia will focus on automotive applications, Michael Zhang, managing partner of Wise Road Capital, said in a statement.Nexperia will also take over NXP's front-end wafer fabs in the U.K. and Germany, as well as its back-end facilities in China, Malaysia and the Philippines. All in-house equipment, patents and IP associated with the Standard Products division will transfer to Nexperia.The Standard Products division accounted for 12% of NXP's total sales in Q1, down from 22% in the year-earlier quarter. For 2015, it pulled in $1.2 billion in sales, about 20% of the total.Following the transaction, NXP's automotive and mobile segments will remain unchanged at 41% and 15%, respectively, of total sales, NXP said Tuesday. Its computing, consumer, communications infrastructure and industrial units will fluctuate by 1 percentage point apiece.Automotive is NXP's most important unit, NXP CEO Rick Clemmer told IBD in May. NXP acquired Freescale Semiconductor last year to become the top automotive chip player. Now, NXP is working with Tesla Motors (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple and Ford (F), as those companies develop self-driving cars.""This transaction is a positive accomplishment for all parties involved,"" Clemmer said Monday in a statement.

62,IP,"Manny Rivelo, incoming chief executive of F5 Networks, has a tough act to follow, but he has brought a new way of thinking at the company. Under John McAdam, F5's CEO since 2000, the company grew to $1.7 billion in 2014 revenue, up from $100 million when he took the reins. McAdam is retiring June 30, but will stay on as board chairman.
"
63,IP,"Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) is the No. 1 seller of application delivery controllers, which direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.
"
64,IP,"Rivelo knows what it takes to grow scale in the IT industry, having worked at Cisco Systems (CSCO) for 19 years before joining F5 as vice president of security and strategic solutions in 2011. Cisco grew into a $44 billion company by the time Rivelo had departed. Its 20-year CEO, John Chambers, is retiring in July.
"
65,IP,"At Cisco, Rivelo's responsibilities spanned both engineering and sales.
"
66,IP,"Rivelo already has helped put in place strategies that aim to keep F5 a leader in information technology, as cloud computing drives big changes in corporate data centers. F5 is pushing into corporate security and subscription-based software, aiming to sell ADC-as-a-service.
"
67,IP,"""Manny has really driven strategy (amid) a very disruptive technology environment,"" McAdam told IBD. ""He brought a focus on software solutions, subscriptions and made us think about things we tended not to think about.""
"
68,IP,"F5's hardware business is still healthy, as customers upgrade to a new generation — ""big IP"" — of ADCs that handle higher data traffic. Building up F5's software business, though, is key.
"
69,IP,"For several years now F5 has sold software-based, or virtual, ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers.
"
70,IP,"In November, F5 unveiled a cloud strategy called ""Silverline,"" that at first will focus on security products. The Silverline service is similar in concept to infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, by which client companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet. Rivelo says F5's Silverline customer will be able to buy its software security products and eventually ADC software.
"
71,IP,"""If we're able to execute on our strategy, that subscription business will become material in a couple of years and we'll have a long tail of revenue coming from that,"" Rivelo said in an interview.
"
72,IP,"For shareholders, one question is whether Rivelo can keep F5's revenue growth in the double digits, or at least above the IT industry average. Many large companies are spending less on their own IT equipment, choosing instead to rent computing and data storage resources via the Internet.
"
73,IP,"F5's revenue growth has slowed to the midteens from blistering 30%-40% growth in 2010-11. F5 stock was a big winner in 2009 and 2010, but it touched its all-time high in January 2011 — above 145. Shares touched a three-year high above 136 in December and are now trading near 128.
"
74,IP,"With analysts expecting consolidation among IT hardware and software companies, another question is whether F5 will be a buyer, a seller or stay on the sidelines. Bernstein Research speculated this year that data storage system maker EMC (EMC) could target F5. And Cisco, which makes a ton of acquisitions, is also a potential buyer.
"
75,IP,"Rivelo says one of F5's strengths is its many partnerships across the IT industry. Partners include Cisco, VMware (VMW) and more recently in the public cloud, IaaS leader Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN). It's also teamed with Ericsson (ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).
"
76,IP,"Rivelo says F5 Networks may be better off staying independent, rather than being acquired by a bigger company. Besides the EMC speculation by Bernstein in March, F5 seems to surface as a rumored takeover target roughly every other year. The company's market valuation exceeds $9 billion.

77,IP,"""Part of our value is that we're sort of (technology) agnostic,"" he said. ""We think we're in a good position to help our customers and grow our business.
"
78,IP,"""If we were acquired, the (product) integration would be much more vertical, and our solution set could be more limited in the market because of the vertical integration an acquirer would want. Being independent is probably the right approach as we move forward.""
"
79,IP,"F5 Networks competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.
"
80,IP,"SDN targets communications networks and tasks usually performed by routers and other specialized hardware. SDN, which many analysts saw as a threat to F5's core business, has turned into a sales channel opportunity for F5, with partners such as Cisco and VMware.
"
81,IP,"Many large companies are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.

82,IP,"Rivelo says F5 Networks is focused on the hybrid-cloud segment.

ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.Rivelo knows what it takes to grow scale in the IT industry, having worked at Cisco Systems (CSCO) for 19 years before joining F5 as vice president of security and strategic solutions in 2011. Cisco grew into a $44 billion company by the time Rivelo had departed. Its 20-year CEO, John Chambers, is retiring in July.At Cisco, Rivelo's responsibilities spanned both engineering and sales.Rivelo already has helped put in place strategies that aim to keep F5 a leader in information technology, as cloud computing drives big changes in corporate data centers. F5 is pushing into corporate security and subscription-based software, aiming to sell ADC-as-a-service.""Manny has really driven strategy (amid) a very disruptive technology environment,"" McAdam told IBD. ""He brought a focus on software solutions, subscriptions and made us think about things we tended not to think about.""F5's hardware business is still healthy, as customers upgrade to a new generation — ""big IP"" — of ADCs that handle higher data traffic. Building up F5's software business, though, is key.For several years now F5 has sold software-based, or virtual, ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers.In November, F5 unveiled a cloud strategy called ""Silverline,"" that at first will focus on security products. The Silverline service is similar in concept to infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, by which client companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet. Rivelo says F5's Silverline customer will be able to buy its software security products and eventually ADC software.""If we're able to execute on our strategy, that subscription business will become material in a couple of years and we'll have a long tail of revenue coming from that,"" Rivelo said in an interview.For shareholders, one question is whether Rivelo can keep F5's revenue growth in the double digits, or at least above the IT industry average. Many large companies are spending less on their own IT equipment, choosing instead to rent computing and data storage resources via the Internet.F5's revenue growth has slowed to the midteens from blistering 30%-40% growth in 2010-11. F5 stock was a big winner in 2009 and 2010, but it touched its all-time high in January 2011 — above 145. Shares touched a three-year high above 136 in December and are now trading near 128.With analysts expecting consolidation among IT hardware and software companies, another question is whether F5 will be a buyer, a seller or stay on the sidelines. Bernstein Research speculated this year that data storage system maker EMC (EMC) could target F5. And Cisco, which makes a ton of acquisitions, is also a potential buyer.Rivelo says one of F5's strengths is its many partnerships across the IT industry. Partners include Cisco, VMware (VMW) and more recently in the public cloud, IaaS leader Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN). It's also teamed with Ericsson (ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).Rivelo says F5 Networks may be better off staying independent, rather than being acquired by a bigger company. Besides the EMC speculation by Bernstein in March, F5 seems to surface as a rumored takeover target roughly every other year. The company's market valuation exceeds $9 billion.""Part of our value is that we're sort of (technology) agnostic,"" he said. ""We think we're in a good position to help our customers and grow our business.""If we were acquired, the (product) integration would be much more vertical, and our solution set could be more limited in the market because of the vertical integration an acquirer would want. Being independent is probably the right approach as we move forward.""F5 Networks competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.SDN targets communications networks and tasks usually performed by routers and other specialized hardware. SDN, which many analysts saw as a threat to F5's core business, has turned into a sales channel opportunity for F5, with partners such as Cisco and VMware.Many large companies are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Rivelo says F5 Networks is focused on the hybrid-cloud segment.""Our strategy is to drive a hybrid set of solutions,"" he said. ""We see the modernization of the private data center as a combination, or a mix, of hardware and software, making applications more agile using a software-defined architecture.""Our vision is that applications are being liberated to run in multiple locations. We're aiming to create the same consistency of service by making our software portable for those environments.""

151,IP,"Bitcoin's astonishing ascent appeared set to continue Monday, with the world's largest cryptocurrency poised to breach the key psychological barrier of $10,000. Meanwhile, several stocks with cryptocurrency or blockchain ties were moving sharply as well.X Bitcoin rose to a record $9,732.76 in early New York trade before trimming gains to $9,599.54, up 2.9%. It's up more than 900% so far this year, according to Bitcoin Price Index.The 10,000 milestone would come just a week after bitcoin crossed $8,000, although the price action for the virtual currency has been marked by sharp slumps and strong rallies this year. Many skeptics warn of a bitcoin bubble, but even Wall Street stalwarts are warming to the technology. CME Group (CME) hopes to launch bitcoin futures in December, and Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) are exploring cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology — JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reportedly is mulling letting its customers bet on Bitcoin futures even though JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned Bitcoin is a ""fraud"" doomed to failure.As bitcoin rose Monday, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an exchange traded note backed by Bitcoin, leapt 24%. GBTC gives investors a way to trade Bitcoin easily over the counter, but is also seen as an expensive and potentially dangerous investment.Marathon Patent Group (MARA), an IP licensing company set to acquire Global Bit Ventures, a cryptocurrency miner, rose 9.4% to 6.51 but that was after skyrocketing to 10.03 intraday. Marathon Patent shares fell to about 6 in late trading ahead of a planned 4:30 p.m. ET conference call regarding its recent cryptocurrency mining acquisition.Among other Bitcoin plays, Overstock.com sank 9.3% on the stock market today, Square (SQ) tumbled 16% and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) sank 34%. But all three stocks are up sharply in recent weeks, at least in part due to Bitcoin buzz.Overstock has invested in blockchain technology.

152,IP,"Antitrust regulators from around the world are frequent news items in the United States — almost never for a good reason.Attention has come as the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), the Japan Fair Trade Commission, China's National Development and Reform Commission, and the European Union's Competition Directorate have imposed fines approaching or exceeding $1 billion in individual cases against industry-leading U.S. high-technology firms, including Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Google, often also insisting on changes to operations or pricing that will reduce the firms' competitive advantages.XNew KFTC chairman Kim Sang-Jo, for one, recently promised even more aggressive activity against use of intellectual property to advance leading firms' positions. U.S. authorities should take note — and action.The targeted firms are all successful innovators with extensive intellectual property (IP), and use of their IP has been a focus of antitrust regulators' complaints. Antitrust regulators have interpreted competition law to prevent innovation-based competition by limiting foreign firms' ability to profit from innovative success, viewing a single firm's use of its own IP at the expense of competitors as anti-competitive.Paradoxically, the higher the value of the innovation, the larger the punishment imposed on a firm succeeding by its virtue.Targeting leading foreign firms helps competing firms at home (along with some foreign competitors and downstream purchasers) while increasing officials' power over global commerce. But the expanding scope of KFTC and other regulatory bodies — particularly with their focus on restraining use of legally-granted IP rights by individual firms, not cartels — harms both the U.S. economy and economic progress around the world.Innovation, strong and stable property rights, trade, and respect for the rule of law are key pillars of economic progress and national success. Commitment to these four principles by the U.S. and other nations, largely those described as ""the West,"" in the seven decades following World War II powered an unprecedented increase in global prosperity (an almost fourfold increase in per capita GDP, accounting for more than three-fourths of the improvement in living standards in the last 10,000 years).Protection of intellectual property rights that promote innovation, of trade that distributes innovative products, and of legal rules that secure unbiased treatment of rights-holders, is critical to continued advancement. Because of this, multilateral agreements under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) now incorporate protections against many actions impairing trade-related intellectual property rights.While using WTO procedures to enforce international trade rules is an obvious first-best route to fight violations, WTO dispute resolution is a notoriously lengthy process — one that also can be distorted by the same forces that impel antitrust authorities to put protection of domestic firms over rules that promote competition, especially competition in innovation. For the same reason, discussions among antitrust authorities, including U.S. officials, can fall prey to similar incentives to expand regulators' reach.A provision of U.S. trade law, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, allows independent U.S. action to combat violations of trade agreements, and an amendment to the law commonly labeled ""Special 301,"" directs the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) annually to list nations that violate U.S. intellectual property rights and prioritize negotiations with nations that are the worst offenders.Despite legitimate fears that departures from multilateral dispute resolution processes can undermine global rule-based trade regimes — that Section 301 could devolve into a trade-distorting protectionist tool — this ""naming and shaming"" approach, combined with priority for discussions with the other nations, is consistent with our international commitments.Properly implemented, it can complement and reinforce those commitments, prodding compliance with international undertakings that benefit people around the world. Given the bold actions of entities like the KFTC, USTR would be justified in putting nations whose antitrust authorities undermine competition and devalue intellectual property on the Special 301 lists and even initiating an investigation under its broader Section 301 authority, which also can produce negotiated solutions rather than departure from WTO accords.Those who champion open trade should know that enforcing trade rules is critical to maintaining an open-trade regime — and that preventing other nations from systematically targeting cutting-edge U.S. firms helps not just the U.S. economy but a broader global economy based on innovation, competition, and law.The best means to protect IP rights, promote competition, and enforce trade rules may be debated, but the need to support those goals, and the risk evolving antitrust regimes pose to them, should be common ground.

153,IP,"Walt Disney's (DIS) answer to Netflix (NFLX) won't have as much content, but it will be priced ""substantially below"" the streaming entertainment service, and that — in combination with a few other major announcements Thursday — has been enough to make investors happy enough to dismiss the media titan's surprise drop in profit and revenue.XThe rival platform, which is set to include an impressive roster of content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, will make its debut in the latter half of 2019, said Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger on the call.In addition to ""thousands of hours"" of Disney movies and TV shows, there's also a live-action ""Star Wars"" series, a TV spinoff of ""Monsters, Inc.,"" a ""High School Musical"" series and a Marvel show in the works.Having also decided to pull Marvel and Lucasfilm movies off Netflix, the moves signal that Disney is not afraid to draw upon its vast well of intellectual property to lure in new subscribers.Furthermore, the studio will produce ""four or five"" movies a year, exclusively for the Disney service.""We continue to believe Disney's IP will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN and recent investments into direct-to-consumer products,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers, calling Disney the ""best positioned"" to leverage its content amid a fragmented media terrain.Even as Iger played down talk of Disney's streaming platform aiming to be a ""Netflix killer,"" calling the company ""a good partner of ours,"" he made his goals for content quite clear.""As I've said earlier, we're going launch this thing pretty aggressively,"" he said on the call Thursday. ""But I think what you'll see is a ramp-up over time of production spending that will start with a product that we believe is representative of the great brands and franchises that we have, between Marvel and Disney and Pixar and 'Star Wars,' and then grow from there.""Management declined to comment on media reports that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had explored a sale of most of itself to Disney, but some are wondering if Disney will look to bulk up its library of content even further as it seeks to attract viewers of its stand-alone service.Needham analyst Laura Martin said the success of previous acquisitions and the lower streaming-service price point ""could be a key strategic driver for the acquisition of FOXA or another large and diversified film and TV library.""Disney rose about 2% to 104.79 in the stock market today. Iger's newsy bombshells late Thursday sent slumping shares reversing higher, despite the media conglomerate's unexpected profit and revenue declines that initially hit the stock. Disney shares climbed 6.2% for the week, mostly on the reported Fox talks.Netflix investors are taking notice of the Disney threat. Netflix fell 1% to 192.02 on Friday after falling as low as 189.50, briefly undercutting a 190.05 buy point. The streaming internet giant broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 5, with the catalyst being its plan to hike subscription rates.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.News that there will be a whole new ""Star Wars"" trilogy sent the internet rippling, and the films are no doubt expected to be blockbusters unless audiences start to feel Lucasfilm fatigue — which they haven't, so far.ESPN, the focus of many an earnings call past, largely escaped scrutiny Thursday, thanks to Iger's announcement that the new direct-to-consumer, ad-supported streaming platform will be called ESPN Plus and will be set to debut in the spring of 2018.RELATED:Disney To Price OTT Service Below Netflix, Announces New Star Wars Trilogy21st Century Fox Loses A Prince As Disney Buzz Continues; Earnings On Tap'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?Walt Disney Held Recent Talks To Buy Most Of 21st Century Fox: CNBCAT&T To Hold DOJ Pick To His Word Amid Trump CNN PressureNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

154,IP,"Alphabet unit Google (GOOGL) will pay $1.1 billion to HTC in a cooperation agreement, the companies said late Wednesday. Some of the Taiwanese firm's employees, many of which worked on Google's Pixel smartphones, will join the internet giant. Google also will get some HTC intellectual property via a nonexclusive license.Rumors of a Google-HTC deal had been building, with reports of an imminent deal Wednesday after Taiwan's stock exchange said that HTC would not open for trading Thursday.HTC was once a major smartphone maker, but its market share has withered to near zero in recent years.Google bought Motorola Mobility in 2011 for $12.5 billion. It sold the business to Lenovo for $2.91 billion in 2014. Google had already sold off Motorola's cable TV gear business and kept most of Motorola's patents, but the episode was still seen as a drain on time and money.Google got back into smartphones via its Pixel handsets last year with HTC's help. New Pixels are expected in early October, about a month before the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X is released.The Google-HTC deal is expected to close in 2018.RELATED:Will HTC Help Google In Smartphones Or Be Another Motorola?FANG Stocks News & Quotes

155,IP,"America's trade negotiators are now in the process ‎of crafting a 2.0 update of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Fortunately, it now appears that Donald Trump's intention on NAFTA is to mend it, not end it. The trade deal has been a stunning economic success for all three nations: Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. Freer trade has meant steady increases in the volume of trade, greater competitiveness, and lower prices.But Trump is right that under NAFTA 2.0 some things need to be fixed to guarantee fair play and to assure America's continued commanding heights in technology and innovation. ‎Intellectual property rights — patents, copyrights, and so on — need to be better safeguarded.There have been abuses. In an unprecedented move, Canadian regulators recently ordered an American pharmaceutical company to lower the price of its breakthrough treatment for a rare blood disorder. The decision was based on currency exchange fluctuations between 2012 and 2014, which increased the relative cost of the medicine— despite that the company obviously having no control over currency values.It's a classic shakedown, where Canada is inventing new rules to avoid paying American pharmaceutical and technology companies for their innovations and inventions. This is also happening in Europe where the euro-bureaucrats are trying to expropriate funds from American technology leaders like Google through bogus charges of monopoly activities.The Trump administration should vigorously repel these economic attacks against American companies.This is a very big deal for the American economy. Intellectual property is increasingly the lifeblood of our economy. IP-intensive industries support 28 million American jobs — or about one in five workers. About $6 trillion of our GDP now is in IP related industries — including almost all of Silicon Valley.‎ Many of NAFTA's IP provisions are out-of-date or under-enforced. While access to foreign markets through international trade clearly benefits innovative companies, unchecked infringement of patent rights and in some cases, outright theft (as in the case of China), costs American consumers and businesses $300 billion annually.Consider our drug companies. ‎American pharmaceuticals recorded global sales of $47 billion in 2015. Yet despite that the vast majority of drug breakthroughs come  from America, the U.S. currently has a $700 million trade deficit with Canada, and only a tiny trade surplus with Mexico in biopharmaceuticals.As the latest decision against Alexion shows, Canadian regulators are imposing de facto price controls on new drugs, failing to value the research and development investment required to invent these breakthroughs in the first place. It typically requires $500 million to $1 billion to develop a new drug or vaccine, and American consumers shouldn't bear the entire burden of those costs.This drives up health insurance costs in America, it is unfair to the investors in these products, and  it jeopardizes world health by delaying the development of future cures. The renegotiated NAFTA agreement must include clear language requiring all disputes over  pricing to appropriately value American innovation and be transparent.For its part, Mexico is producing ""knock off"" drugs that are copycats of American pharmaceuticals. This is stealing too, and negotiators should get tough with these practices south of our border.‎ The same abuses are happening with American trademarks and copyrighted materials. Canada and Mexico are two of the top export destinations form American entertainment and media. Yet NAFTA doesn't sufficiently protect online theft and distribution of movies, music, games and so on. To bring IP protections up to date for the digital age, a renegotiated NAFTA should include civil and criminal penalties for illicit access to cable and satellite signals and other preventable infringements in which the American producers are not compensated for use of the product.The future of free and fair trade depends on rigorous enforcement of America's multi-trillion dollar IP industries. This is about jobs, fairness, and the rule of law. It is also about encouraging the very innovation process that leads to prosperity and better health in America — which we then export across the globe to the betterment of mankind. It will also help boost public and business support for trade as a driver of growth in the years to come.

156,IP,"The recent failed round of Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union highlights that immense uncertainty that faces companies hoping for clarity about new trade arrangements.The fog isn't likely to lift anytime soon. From the Brexit ""divorce"" negotiations to an alphabet of trade agreements in peril, such as Nafta, Korus and TPP, global companies are anxious about the future, and that could put the world economy at risk.At issue is that political upheaval over the last 18 months has nudged the world trading system to an inflection point from which it will prove difficult to recover if unhindered movement of goods and the protection of intellectual property are not assured.Elections in the U.S. and United Kingdom have sparked a wave of populism, injecting a nationalist strain into global politics, putting at risk ""accepted norms"" for trade and jeopardizing the economic connections that have allowed the world to grow and prosper. Regulations and standards that have governed international commerce for a half-century are under fire or are atrophying as nations and regions vie for short-term advantage at the expense of long-term prosperity.The resulting uncertainty — if not resolved quickly — could slow economic growth as the bureaucracy and expense associated with the movement of goods increases and the intellectual property that underpins the growth  becomes more complicated to protect and more urgent to deliver.Intellectual property is the lifeblood of innovative companies in the 21st century. IP is what gives a company its edge in the marketplace. IP protections, enshrined in trade agreements, ensure that a company's most treasured asset — its innovation and brainpower — don't migrate unfairly to the competition without steep consequences.IP protections have a cascading impact on the economy at large. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative points out that ""nearly 40 million American jobs are directly or indirectly attributable to 'IP-intensive' industries. These jobs pay higher wages to their workers, and these industries drive approximately 60% of U.S. merchandise exports and a large share of services exports.""In short, as the USTR maintains, strong protection and enforcement of IP rights are ""critical to U.S. economic growth and American jobs.""That's certainly true from the perspective of the company that I lead, Waters Corp., which designs, manufactures, sells and services high-performance analytical measurement technology used in drug discovery and development, materials characterization, nutritional safety and quality, and environmental testing.Harmonization of global standards and consistency and enforcement of regulations and trade regimes that open markets to fair commerce have been major reasons for our success and why we have grown to a $2 billion company employing 7,000 people worldwide. Continuity of rules and order in markets is a priority for Waters and all global industries — and it should be for governments, as well.Recent efforts to firm up the future of once-rock-solid trade pacts and political unions that ensured IP rights have only added to corporate anxiety.The EU talks on Brexit have been marked by acrimony and uncertainty. Britain's leaders have said they will create new markets and opportunities to replace the old ones. However, there doesn't appear to be sufficient urgency in London or Brussels as the terms of the divorce take precedence over any new marriage.On this side of the Atlantic, recent efforts to renegotiate the terms of the Nafta trade pact were underscored by starkly different visions with no clear indication that an agreement is in sight.The U.S. administration has stated a desire to replace the scuttled Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact with bilateral agreements and perhaps delay further progress on a European agreement until Brexit has been worked out. This could be years away, exacerbating uncertainty. And EU nations, the U.K. and the U.S. could face tremendous pressure to enact a patchwork of ""one-off"" trade deals fragmenting the trading system and creating a leadership void that may be filled by China and others.The pathway for success is clear: Political leaders must quickly negotiate new trade agreements that restore certainty to commerce.New agreements must not erase hard-fought common regulatory boundaries or leave any doubt about IP protections. Otherwise, innovation will suffer, job growth will slow, and the general well-being of the world will be compromised.

157,IP,"There's a good chance you've heard of the Apple (AAPL) AppStore or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play, but you probably don't know that a relative unknown, RingCentral (RNG), has its own version of an online software store featuring applications that pull data through the company's systems some 9 million times daily.XAs of June, roughly 5,000 developers were integrating and customizing applications from RingCentral's App Gallery to work with the company's open business communications platform, launched in 2015. The statistics offer a hint of the scope of RingCentral's ambition to do for business communications what the iPhone has done for personal communications — make it simple, seamless and pervasive.In that field, there's room to run. Despite the explosion of cloud-based software as a service, business communications is stubbornly clunky, dominated by legacy systems that aren't ideal for securely providing data, analytics and collaborative tools that work forces need in telephony, internet, messaging and videoconferencing.""Most business UC (unified communications) solutions still lag behind consumer software in terms of usability and user appeal,"" wrote Frost & Sullivan in a recent report. The market research firm sees RingCentral not just as an exception but as a standout, naming the Belmont, Calif., firm its 2017 North American Hosted IP Telephony and Unified Communications as a Service Company of the Year.Unlike competitors that deliver team messaging on a separate, loosely integrated platform, Frost & Sullivan notes, RingCentral stands out. That's partly due to its Glip collaboration software for sharing files, running projects and managing task lists being centralized, providing the primary access point for its entire communications suite.The full integration of Glip, which RingCentral acquired in 2015, has been ""winning us some of our major deals,"" Chief Executive Vlad Shmunis said on the company's Aug. 2 second-quarter earnings call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Among the customer wins were Pacific Dental Services, with 500 locations in 17 states; ExtraSpace Storage, the second largest operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S.; and an unnamed Fortune 1000 global retailer deploying RingCentral's solution to 5,000 users globally. That big retail customer was ready to move on from on-premise systems bought from Avaya, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January.While cloud business communications — also known as unified communications as a service or UCaaS — is a fast-growing field, it's barely scratched the surface of the potential market.Synergy Research Group says that cloud business communications grew 23% in the first quarter of 2017 and now generates about $2 billion in annual revenue per year. By comparison, the potential market size in the U.S. alone weighs in at about $25 billion.""We continue to believe the enterprise market is ripe for disruption by cloud communication players, and RingCentral is well-positioned with its expansive product set (including contact center and collaboration tools), global capabilities, tight integrations, and open API platform,"" William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri said in a recent note to clients.RingCentral is the market leader based on quarterly revenues and has been consistently growing its market share, says Synergy. As of the second quarter, RingCentral's revenue run rate for unified communications as a service was $478 million, and it's targeting at least $1 billion in revenue in 2020.Suri estimated in May that Avaya's troubles could provide a tailwind as some customers bolt to cloud players, with RingCentral the biggest likely beneficiary. The potential for $150 million in revenue over three years could lead to an acceleration in revenue growth for RingCentral, he noted.""The cloud is winning, and RingCentral is winning in the cloud,"" Shmunis said on the August call. ""Our broad platform enables our customers to replace multiple products and services from vendors like Cisco (CSCO), Avaya, WebEx, Slack, Five9 (FIVN) and others with a single unified solution from RingCentral.""Over the past two years, RingCentral has moved from primarily serving small business to midmarket firms to chasing big fish. Now with 17 data centers across four regions, its global office service streamlines multicountry communications under one system. That was among the selling points for the big retail client it landed last quarter.In 12 months through June, midmarket and enterprise customers combined for $131 million in revenue, up 80% from a year earlier.IBD'S TAKE: RingCentral is ranked No. 5 in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as relative stock performance. See how your stocks rank at IBD Stock Checkup, among the premium IBD features now free through Oct. 8. Also read The Big Picture, a daily update of the underlying market trend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market-trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green.  Earlier this month, Gartner said that RingCentral's UCaaS platform vision is the most complete in the industry and its execution is matched only by Verizon among the industry leaders. 8x8 (EGHT) also was among the leaders.""We've been overinvesting in R&D for a number of years,"" Shmunis told investors at a Sept. 12 Deutsche Bank technology conference.Northland Securities analyst Michael Latimore noted in a Sept. 18 report that the cumulative research and development spending gap between itself and its closest cloud-focused competitor is ""about $200 million and growing.""Customers have noticed. Latimore, after meeting with management, wrote that RingCentral's win rate when it competes for new deals ranging from 250 to 1000 seats has been in the 80% range. ""More recently, that has moved up to 90%-plus.""Gartner called RingCentral a strong option for enterprises with up to 5,000 employees, while adding that larger enterprises typically stick with major brands like Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco and Google, along with the major communications service providers.Yet Suri told IBD that as RingCentral continues to ""move up market, as they execute, the sky is the limit.""He noted that the company is already selling ""multithousand-seat deals"" and landed Hyatt Hotels (H) earlier this year.Hyatt will initially deploy RingCentral for its Chicago headquarters, but with potential for a rollout to global regional offices and then its hotels.That potential for current customers to keep deepening their relationship with RingCentral — the company calls it ""land and expand"" — has been one of the drivers of its performance. In its second-quarter earnings call, management said that its net churn retention rate among midmarket and enterprise accounts, factoring in both lost business and expansion by existing clients, exceeds 125%.Shares of RingCentral shot up 8% on Aug. 9 to a record high on a report that the company had hired an advisor in response to a buyout offer. The current buy point, the point at which investors have the best chance of near-term gains, is at 43.15, just above that Aug. 9 peak. Shares of RingCentral jumped 4% Friday, closing at 41.75 at the end of the regular trading session.Suri called RingCentral ""one of the most-attractive targets for a potential consolidator given the company's leading market position and best-of-breed product.""While he expects that management would sell at the right price, ""the premium they probably want is pretty high,"" Suri said.RELATED:This Potential Breakout Stock May Also Be A Takeover TargetBroadSoft Stock Falls As Guidance Misses ExpectationsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

160,IP,"President Trump asked his top trade official to consider investigating how China handles intellectual property, adding to the list of trade irritants between the world's two biggest economies as they work to contain North Korea.Trump signed an executive memorandum on Monday directing U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider investigating China's IP policies, especially the practice of forcing U.S. companies operating there to transfer technological know-how.""It's my duty and responsibility to protect the American workers' technology and industry from unfair and abusive actions,"" Trump said at the White House. ""We will stand up to any country that unlawfully forces American companies to transfer their valuable technology as a condition of market access. We will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs.""China responded Tuesday morning in Beijing with a Ministry of Commerce statement expressing serious concern and saying it ""will resort to all proper measures"" to firmly defend its lawful rights if the U.S. disregards multilateral rules and hurts bilateral trade ties.""The U.S. should cherish the current good trade ties and rapport with China, and any protectionist move will certainly damage bilateral economic relations and hurt the business interests of companies in both countries,"" the ministry said in its statement.If China is found to be flouting the rules on U.S. intellectual property, the administration has a range of options, including imposing import tariffs, according to administration officials, who spoke to reporters Saturday on the condition of anonymity. If USTR moves forward, the investigation could take as long as a year.""The United States has for many years been facing a very serious problem. China industrial policies and other practices reportedly have forced the transfer of vital U.S. technology to Chinese companies,"" Lighthizer said in a statement, adding that the review will be one of USTR's highest priorities.He said USTR will do a ""thorough"" investigation and take action if needed ""to preserve the future of U.S. industry.""Trump beginning the process of potentially starting an investigation is similar to a 2010 Obama administration probe that ended with a negotiated settlement with the Chinese government, according to Jacob Parker, a vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. That exchange didn't lead to any unilateral U.S. action or affect bilateral economic relations, he said Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview.""It's premature now to say whether or not this will have a long-term irritant effect on the Chinese-U.S. trade relationship,"" Parker said. Both economies benefit from positive trade relations, and ""any kind of trade war, tit-for-tat exchange, would negatively impact both countries, they would also negatively impact the U.S. consumer and manufacturer.""Meanwhile, the top Democrat in the Senate said the president hasn't yet matched his tough talk on China with action. ""To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is OK to keep stealing,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.Chinese state media on Monday criticized Trump's plans for an IP probe, saying the action will do more harm than good, whether it's a new policy approach or negotiating tactic.The move comes amid growing tension over the threat of North Korea using nuclear weapons, and less than two weeks after the U.S. received China's help in the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions on Pyongyang.Chinese President Xi Jinping moved to calm nerves last week, telling the U.S. president during a phone call that all sides should maintain restraint and avoid inflammatory comments. While the White House said the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, Trump has previously criticized China for not reining in North Korea, and threatened trade measures if Xi fails to act.Trump's announcement further complicates the already taut U.S.-China relationship, which took a frosty turn last month when officials from both nations couldn't agree on a joint statement over economic issues after high-level talks in Washington.Still, Trump's actions stop short of what some analysts had been expecting him to do on intellectual property. Rather than launching straight into a probe, USTR will first consider whether to begin an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. That law allows the president to impose tariffs on foreign products in response to unfair or discriminatory restrictions on American commerce. The 301 provision has practically fallen into disuse since the mid-1990s after the creation of the World Trade Organization.Administration officials on Saturday declined to say how long it will take before a decision is made whether to start a probe.In a USTR report to lawmakers that was released in July, the administration accused China of engaging in ""widespread infringing activity, including trade secret theft, rampant online piracy and counterfeiting, and high levels of physical pirated and counterfeit exports to markets around the globe.""Earlier this year, a commission on U.S. intellectual property estimated that the annual cost to the U.S. economy in counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets from all sources exceeds $225 billion and could be as high as $600 billion. China is the world's principal IP infringer, the commission said.USTR argues Beijing uses a range of practices to force U.S. companies to transfer IP, such as by granting regulatory approvals to drug makers that shift production to China or requiring that the designs of foreign products be replicable in China.

163,IP,"Stop by the Wright Brothers memorial next time you're in the Outer Banks and you'll walk away grateful for their contribution as engineers to the world of flight. However, their contribution to the industry writ large that lets so many of us travel safely and efficiently across the planet left something to be desired.XAfter their historic flight, the brothers' efforts focused not on improving on their amazing invention but, instead, on aggressively litigating anyone who tried to get his own designs into the air. While preoccupied with litigation, the brothers weren't developing better aircraft designs, and within a few years Wright planes had been surpassed by their competition.Eventually, the government put an end to Wright's patent battles when the exigencies of World War I compelled it to do so, but had that not occurred it's possible that domestic aviation might have lagged the rest of the world, and the job-creating and technology-expanding behemoths of the U.S. aeronautics industry might be located somewhere else.Which brings us to a similar problem today: Qualcomm, a behemoth of the tech world, seems to be similarly focused more on litigation than innovation.At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in July, the house that Steve built released the new iPhone operating system — iOS 11, a prelude to the long-awaited iPhone 8. But while Apple looks forward, Qualcomm remains focused on milking its old technologies that have been profitable in the past, notably the iPhone's baseband chips.The same week as the conference, Qualcomm was back in court replying to its initial motion to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) case against it. Fortunately, U.S. District Judge Lisa Koh recently ruled against Qualcomm's motion to dismiss, but the company's effort to maintain market share through litigation instead of innovation must be criticized.While most intellectual property litigation — including this one — can be somewhat technical, the core principle at stake here can be boiled down to one key point: upholding the right of any company to access technology standards deemed ""essential"" to a certain technology. In this case, it entails making a phone interoperable with mobile networks.Special licensing requirements apply when a technology is considered essential and the holders of that IP must make that technology available to anyone under Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Qualcomm appears to have continually ignored or abused its FRAND commitments and this lawsuit is a response to that.Technology giants like Apple, Samsung, and Intel have detailed how Qualcomm has been violating FRAND, which has slowed innovation and created an unnecessarily contentious licensing environment. But beyond that, Qualcomm's behavior has disproportionately hindered smaller tech companies and startups trying to enter this ultracompetitive.New tech companies are often the source of disruptive technologies that challenge the big players to continue innovating, but without FRAND such innovations rarely get off the ground. As a result, too many tech startups fail and competition wanes, with the entire tech sector and the broader economy suffering as a result.According to a 2015 study, patent litigation costs the economy upward of $29 billion a year in direct costs and as much as $80 billion indirectly, which represents an exceedingly large piece of the pie essentially going to lawyers instead of research and development. How can a struggling technology startup become the next Pied Piper when they have to waste money fighting tech giants and patent trolls?This problem will only be exacerbated as we enter the age of the Internet of Things. Controlling IoT markets and technologies is a top focus of Qualcomm's current business strategy. If it manages to abuse FRAND and limit access to essential IoT technologies, it would have potentially deleterious consequences on this transformative new industry.Access to essential technologies is far too important across the tech sector to ignore Qualcomm's actions. The future of innovation may depend on it.Qualcomm can do the right thing or the Wright thing.

164,IP,"Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) believes that clouds have silver linings — and it intends to mine them.XThe Lowell, Mass.-based chipmaker sees an enormous opportunity to supply internet cloud data centers with semiconductor systems to support ever-faster networking capability.Macom Chief Executive John Croteau touted his company's potential to gain business from data-center customers during a recent conference call with analysts, calling them a ""predictable, high-value growth driver for the company for many years to come.""""Personally I haven't seen such a breakout in our part of the industry since the advent of digital handsets and smartphones decades ago,"" Croteau said during the April call. ""It's shaping up to be that big.""In the March quarter, data center sales accounted for 27% of Macom's revenue and the group was its largest end market. Sales in the segment were up 70% year over year, excluding its acquisition of AppliedMicro, which it completed in the quarter.Macom is focusing its resources on maximizing market share gains in the cloud data center market, where demand for its systems is outstripping supply.""With rapidly developing backlog, program awards and customer commitments, it's now clear that 100G and greater optical connectivity in data centers is real and it's far bigger and (happening) far sooner than anyone in the industry has predicted,"" Croteau said.The optical-fiber business has shifted from the ""notoriously cyclical"" carrier-based deployments to cloud data centers, which have ""insatiable demand"" for faster and higher bandwidth connectivity, he said. That shift was evident at the Optical Fiber Conference and Exhibition in Los Angeles in March, Croteau said.Networking gear maker Cisco Systems (CSCO) predicts that internet cloud traffic will nearly quadruple from 2015 to 2020, going from 3.9 zettabytes per year to 14.1. (One zettabyte is equal to 1 billion terabytes.) That includes everything from business software applications to consumer video streams.""Macom is well positioned with a portfolio spanning high-performance analog, lasers, silicon photonics, optical subassemblies and mixed signal (chips) across all protocols and form factors,"" he said.Macom is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday.Analysts expect Macom to earn 69 cents a share, up 35%, on sales of $196 million, up 38%, in the June quarter.Optical-component sales for cloud data centers are likely to be the main driver in fiscal third-quarter results, Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said in a July 11 report. But the sector is expected to face continued headwinds from an inventory buildup in China related to delays in telecom infrastructure upgrades, he said.For the September quarter, Wall Street is modeling Macom to earn 76 cents a share, up 41%, on sales of $205 million, up 34%.Macom stock has been a top performer of late. It broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 53.90 on April 24. It hit a record high of 65.99 intraday on Wednesday.Shares were hit hard Thursday amid a broad market selloff, but started to climb back in Friday action.IBD'S TAKE: Macom Technology Solutions has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, putting it in the top 2% of stocks for performance in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Macom, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Macom's 100-gigabit optical modules are being used by Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit through systems supplied by contract manufacturer Fabrinet (FN). The Amazon deal could lead to business from other providers of cloud computing services, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a June 26 note to clients.""With the industry's broadest portfolio of electronic, photonic and subassembly solutions for datacom modules, Macom in the past has discussed opportunities to partner directly with leading hyperscale operators,"" Bolton said. ""We believe the Amazon-Fabrinet-Macom partnership is one of the first such partnerships. Should this partnership prove successful and ramp to high volume, we imagine it will lead to partnerships with other hyperscale operators.""Macom competitors include Analog Devices (ADI); Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD), which is being acquired by Broadcom (AVGO), and Inphi (IPHI).Macom is on track to enable 4 million 100G ports this year, and sees the total addressable market growing to 40 million to 50 million in 2018 and 2019, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a May 16 note to clients.Later, in a July 11 note, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said Macom is uniquely positioned in the 100G-connectivity space because it controls the whole package from transceiver components to digital-signal processors.Data centers have upgrade cycles every two to three years, vs. telecom service providers which upgrade their systems every five to seven years, Curtis said.""By developing in-house, they are now sharing road maps with key customers and conducting business more like a partnership vs. a transaction,"" Curtis said. ""The top 5 cloud players are rapidly increasing their capex investments and are incentivized to continue as IP (internet protocol) traffic increases.""RELATED:This Ad Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeHomebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

Washington state's insurance commissioner announced a multistate investigation into the matter.""Nearly half of all data breaches reported in the U.S. are health care related,"" Kausik said. ""While major hacking events more commonly make headlines, our research shows that unprotected data on lost or stolen devices represents the majority of breach activity in health care. Some of these devices contain hundreds of thousands of records. This reaffirms the need for health care organizations to re-evaluate their security and compliance strategies.""Health care data is far more valuable to cybercriminals than credit-card information on the black market, the company said.""The credit card industry's efforts to adopt chip-and-PIN technology will further devalue stolen credit card information, making health care data an even more attractive target for hackers,"" said Rich Campagna, Bitglass vice president of products. ""And unlike credit cards, which limit personal liability for fraudulent transactions, there are no such protections in place for victims of health care fraud.""RELATED: Security Standout Qualys Scans For Ways To Grow

196,IP,"Biotech stocks continued to slide Thursday, prompting analysts to weigh in on the causes and prognosis for the sector.Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer noted that the same thing happened about a year ago, sparked by the price debate over Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, but also by valuation concerns after a long runup.""Obviously 2014 turned out to be a stellar year for biotech, and we believe industry fundamentals remain strong,"" he wrote in his research note. ""2015 should still be a good year for the industry, once we pass through this latest round of selling.""Schimmer wrote that profitable big caps such as Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are ""attractively valued relative to peers.""On the other hand, he said money-losing big caps such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) are more difficult to value.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, in his report, wrote that ""it's reasonable and makes sense to us that some correction and profit taking has been possible given the significant outperformance in the first 3 months of 2015.""Yee noted that there were some ""over-exaggerated"" moves by some of the smaller biotechs last week, such as the CAR-T stocks (Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) jumped 24% and Kite Pharma (KITE) rose 14%), which in turn revived long-running concerns about a biotech bubble.Kite stock was down 10% in midday trading in the stock market today, while Juno stock was down 2% after falling more than 7% Wednesday.Yee added, however, that real bear markets are driven by poor fundamentals, which he says aren't evident yet in biotech.""We're watching our '3 pillars of risk': biosimilars (in flux), pricing/rebating, and IP risks, but these seem to be risks to individual companies but not to the whole sector,"" he wrote.Thursday marks the fifth straight trading-day decline for IBD's 368-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech group, which has slumped nearly 12% in that span. For now, though, it still ranks No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biotechs On Track For Worst Week In A Year.

Wang noted Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi's launch Monday of its Yi wearable action camera, which uses Ambarella's chips, and three new camera models launched recently by GoPro.He added that one ""significant growth opportunity"" ahead will come from automotive cameras with 360-degree viewing, aimed at replacing side- and rear-view mirrors.Xiaomi's decision to use Ambarella's chips in its new action camera should contribute to Ambarella's revenue growth in Asia during 2016 and 2017, given the Chinese smartphone maker's strong brand and growing distribution, Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Ramsay said Tuesday.But although action sports cameras remain compelling, he thinks the enterprise security camera and other markets provide larger opportunities.Wang said the professional Internet protocol-based camera market continues to grow rapidly, especially in China, as traditional, analog closed-circuit TV devices are replaced by digital IP cameras. Ambarella is experiencing growth from companies that offer home-monitoring cameras as part of their security services.

292,IP,"Ambarella (AMBA) is often mentioned in the same breath as GoPro because it makes image processing chips for GoPro's popular Hero action cameras. But Ambarella is much more than just a GoPro chip supplier.Ambarella gets an estimated 35% to 40% of its revenue from GoPro (GPRO), the leading maker of wearable sports cameras, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a research report Tuesday. But it gets a similar share of sales from makers of Internet protocol security cameras, including Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT), he said.IP security cameras are used for surveillance and are gradually replacing analog CCTV (closed-circuit television) devices, Seyrafi said.Ambarella is a good play on strong growth in GoPro sales and in IP security cameras, Seyrafi said. He initiated coverage of Ambarella stock with an outperform rating and price target of 70. Ambarella stock rose 1.2% to 56.25 on Tuesday, while GoPro stock has continued to fall.""It is important for investors to realize that although AMBA is a good way to play on GPRO, we estimate that AMBA's IP security revenue (est. 35% year-over-year growth in fiscal 2016) will grow faster than AMBA's sports camera revenue (est. 30% growth) next fiscal year,"" he said. Ambarella's fiscal 2016 began Feb. 1.""Sports camera revenue is estimated at 46% of AMBA's fiscal 2016 revenue while IP security is estimated at 42% of AMBA's fiscal 2016 revenue, so they are rather comparable,"" Seyrafi said. ""Although AMBA believes that with its current businesses it can grow revenue by 20-25% year over year, when one adds additional businesses like home security, drones/UAV, and wearable police cameras, growth of 25-30% year over year near-term is possible.""Ambarella also is well positioned in the automotive video recorder market, Seyrafi said. Automotive cameras, including dashcams, have been particularly popular in countries such as Russia, China, South Korea and Taiwan, where they are used as evidence in car crashes.While action cameras have shown explosive growth recently, the IP video surveillance market is poised to take off, Seyrafi said. The IP video surveillance market is forecast to be worth as much as $57 billion in 2020, which translates to a compound annual growth rate of 37%, he said.""This is a fast-growing market, and AMBA sells to the largest video surveillance companies in the world, such as Hikvision and Axis Communications,"" Seyrafi said.

But it did experience a change in sentiment to the positive in trading Friday.Activision stock was down as much as 7% from Thursday's close in morning trading Friday.

By midafternoon trading on the stock market today, however, Activision stock was down a fraction, below 22.Late Thursday, Activision reported Q4 earnings that beat expectations, but sales in the holiday quarter came up short. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company earned 94 cents a share excluding items, up 19% year over year, on sales of $2.21 billion, down 3%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 88 cents and $2.24 billion.""2014 was another successful year as we achieved record results and introduced new franchises with outstanding gameplay, expanded on exciting new business models and continued investing in some of the world's most important entertainment franchises,"" Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement. ""We expanded our franchise portfolio by launching two of the industry's most successful new brands, Blizzard's 'Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft,' and the biggest new IP launch in industry history, 'Destiny.'""Activision boasted three of the top five best-selling games of 2014: ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,"" ""Destiny"" and ""Skylanders Trap Team.""But Activision forecast declining sales and earnings for the current quarter and year.

307,IP,"Cavium has gone from a specialty niche designer of network security processors 14 years ago to a mainstream player challenging the likes of Intel, Broadcom and Freescale Semiconductor.The San Jose, Calif.-based chipmaker now provides system-on-a-chip microprocessors that are used in a variety of markets and applications, including networking, communications, consumer and broadband. Analysts say its increasingly diverse product offerings are driving growth.On Wednesday, Cavium (CAVM) for the first time surpassed the $100 million mark in revenue for one quarter, posting a 25% year-over-year gain of $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. It reported a 32% year-over-year jump in earnings per share, ex items, of 42 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast EPS minus items of 41 cents on $100 million in revenue.Cavium CEO Syed Ali said in a conference call with analysts late Wednesday that 2015 is expected to be a ""signature year"" for the company, after rolling out ""bold"" strategies in 2012 and 2013 for new lines of products.""This will be the single biggest year of new product introductions in our history,"" Ali said in the call.In the most recent quarter, 91% of the company's sales came from the enterprise and service provider market, with 9% derived from the broadband segment, Cavium Chief Financial Officer Arthur Chadwick said on the call.Pushing Into New MarketsAlthough the enterprise network and data center segment has historically been Cavium's largest for revenue, its efforts to diversify should begin to show results, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research report Thursday.""We believe a rapid diversification in the enterprise segment into an increasing number of customers, coupled with a more recent entry into new markets, should provide Cavium with growth opportunities in excess of its peers,"" Vinh said in the report.FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland said in a research note Thursday that Cavium's ""innovative design team, solid pipeline of new products and ability to increasingly tap into a fast-growing hyperscale customer base should provide a solid backdrop of growth for the next few years.""Rolland, who hiked his target price to $68 from $65 a day after Cavium reported Q4 earnings, expects a huge, long-term market opportunity as it increasingly expands beyond network processors to challenge Intel (INTC) for the microprocessors that control switches and routers. Combined, the potential opportunities could result in an ultimate addressable market 50 times its current market, Rolland said.Analysts expect Cavium to generate $449 million in revenue this year, up 20% from 2014. Earnings per share minus items are expected to jump 26% to $1.85.Cavium's core portfolio of embedded and security processor products for wireless, security and data center markets is expected to drive 20% revenue growth rates this year and into 2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsey told IBD.Stock Market GainerAnalysts' forecast for double-digit-percentage revenue growth, coupled with Cavium's track record of nine straight quarters of double-digit revenue and earnings growth, have helped push the stock up 64% over the past 12 months. It jumped nearly 5% on Thursday.Cavium has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and a Relative Strength Rating of 96. The Composite Rating factors in a variety of metrics, such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. The Relative Strength Rating of 96 puts Cavium stock among the top 4% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.Mobile And Social PullCavium expects to close a $90 million acquisition of Silicon Valley-based Xpliant during the current quarter, adding to its network switching capabilities.Several analysts, including Ramsey and William Blair's Anil Doradla, say the network switching market has the potential to be Cavium's next $100 million product category.Cavium management says Xpliant's expertise in Ethernet switch chips, combined with its own infrastructure technology, enables it to tap the market by addressing the need for increased capacity for both networking infrastructure and data centers. The need is driven by steep growth of mobile applications and social networking.Global mobile data traffic is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 61% between 2013 and 2018, while cloud data center IP traffic will grow at a 30% rate, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index and Global Cloud Index.Ali said in Wednesday's conference call that Xpliant's chips offer fully programmable architecture designed to keep up with the rapid pace of today's networks.""So switchers can adapt to network requirements in weeks, not years, as with previous chips,"" Ali said. ""It allows switch equipment providers to create multiple products from one hardware platform and to update products on the fly to provide new capabilities.""Cavium faces rivals such as Broadcom (BRCM), Intel and Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) .Among new products on tap is Cavium's ThunderX line of processor chips. They are based on ARM Holdings (ARMH) architecture and aimed at data center server and cloud markets, which will compete with Intel's Xeon product line, analysts say.Ramsey says Cray's (CRAY) plans to work with Cavium to use ThunderX processors in its computing systems for the high-performance, supercomputer market illustrate a ""solid early endorsement.""Ali said the increasing number of high visibility security breaches is accelerating the need to secure all networked infrastructure.""These trends are driving continued strong momentum in the securities segment for our products,"" Ali said.Cavium is also rolling out its Octeon III chips for broadband applications and LiquidIO II server adapters for the data center and cloud, among other new products.Ali says Cavium delivered 23% year-over-year top-line revenue growth for all of 2014, and 42% year-over-year non-GAAP earnings growth, gaining market share in both existing networking, communication and security markets, as well as some new markets.Cavium guided Q1 revenue to $101.5 million at the midpoint and EPS ex items of 38-40 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see $101.6 million, up 22% year over year, and EPS of 39 cents, up 30%.The company expects ""traditional seasonal softness"" in the service provider market in Q1, Ali said, especially in wireless infrastructure, with the soft 4G environment partially offset by continued strength in 3G markets.""On the flip side, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in our enterprise and data center market,"" Ali said.

312,IP,"Some prognosticators play it safe with year-ahead predictions. They'll build their forecasts off known events like product launches (Apple Watch, Windows 10, etc.) or extrapolate from current trends (cloud computing, Internet of Things, etc.).But others are much more daring. Like Babe Ruth confidently pointing to the center-field bleachers and swinging for a home run, these forecasters are willing to take a gamble and risk striking out big time.What follows are 10 of the boldest predictions for the tech industry in 2015.1. Twitter gets sold, possibly to GoogleShort-message social network Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) had a rough time in 2014. The microblogging service went public on Nov. 7, 2013, at 26 and ended that year at 63.65. Twitter stock fell 44% in 2014, closing Wednesday at 35.87. The San Francisco-based firm has struggled to grow its active user base and advertising revenue. Some on Wall Street have called for CEO Dick Costolo's head.Chris Ciaccia, technology editor of TheStreet, says Twitter will get bought out in 2015.""Don't be shocked to see Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) come knocking if Twitter's market cap drops below $20 billion,"" he wrote. It ended 2014 with a market cap of $22.4 billion.2. A major Web player buys NetflixCCS Insight, a U.K.-based technology research firm, thinks subscription streaming video firm Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be acquired by a major Web company in 2015.""All Web players are looking for a stronger presence in paid-for video, something Netflix has achieved with remarkable success . .. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Google are potential suitors,"" CCS said in a report. If Google doesn't buy Netflix, it will launch its own video streaming service in 2015, CCS predicted.On a similar note, Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman predicted Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) each will launch subscription video-on-demand services in the new year. He suggested that either of those two could step up and buy Hulu to accelerate their efforts.3. Google buys PayPalEBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to spin off its PayPal unit in 2015. But Bob Pisani, CNBC ""On-Air Stocks"" editor, doesn't think that will happen. Instead, Google will buy PayPal and combine it with Google Wallet to take on Apple Pay in the emerging mobile payments market, he said.Cash-rich search giant Google is a common theme in big acquisition predictions.CCS even predicts that Google will buy action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) in 2015.4. Qualcomm acquires AMD for its IPWireless chip firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) might buy struggling PC and graphics chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just to get its intellectual property to fend off Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), tech journalist Andy Patrizio said in Network World.CCS predicts Qualcomm will gobble up activity-band maker Fitbit in 2015.5. Red Hat buys ClouderaLarry Dignan, editor-in-chief of ZDNet, predicted that Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) will buy IPO candidate Cloudera in 2015.""Red Hat buys Cloudera in a move that solidifies its position in analytics,"" he said. ""Culturally, the two open-source companies could mesh well. From an art of war perspective, Red Hat's acquisition plays keep away from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a long list of other interested parties.""Dignan also predicted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will spin off its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business and that data-storage firm EMC (NYSE:EMC) will merge with Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) enterprise business.6. At least one major 3D printer maker gets acquiredBrian Krassenstein, co-founder and editor-in-chief at 3DPrint.com, predicted that one or more of the following publicly traded 3D printer companies will be acquired by a larger corporation before the end of 2015: 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) or Organovo (AMEX:ONVO).7. Cisco's John Chambers steps downJohn Chambers has been CEO at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) since January 1995, when he was 46 years old. Now 65, and after 20 years at the helm of the networking company, it might be time for Chambers to retire. Of course, that's been rumored for years, as Fortune noted in September.""I thought last year would be the year that Cisco CEO John Chambers stepped down, paving the way for his replacement,"" TheStreet's Ciaccia said. ""As it turns out, I was wrong, but that's not going to stop me from making another prediction for this year.""8. VMware acquires ServiceNowEMC finally will spin off VMware (NYSE:VMW) in 2015, Elias Khnaser, chief technology officer at Sigma Solutions, predicted. VMware will then go on a buying spree, most notably picking up ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), he said.""One of the most important goals of this spree will be to beef up vCloud Air and fend off both Microsoft and Amazon, which won't be easy to do,"" Khnaser said.

350,IP,"As the Trump administration nears the end of its first 100 days, its views on antitrust remains largely uncertain. This is especially the case when it comes to more controversial applications of antitrust to research and development-focused sectors, particularly for new pharmaceutical  and high-tech industries.In his first speech to Congress, President Trump provided few further insights — not once mentioning technology, innovation or competition, other than for health care insurance. He did, however, repeat his view that the U.S. has been exporting jobs overseas and that he would seek to roll back the ""job-crushing regulations"" imposed by previous administrations.While Trump himself does not have much of an antitrust record apart from his involvement in two antitrust suits, he has made a series of public statements that suggest he may be in favor of greater antitrust enforcement.Trump has openly opposed particular mergers in the technology and telecommunications sectors, for example, and pointed to the specific ""antitrust problems"" of particular companies in those sectors while on the campaign trail.The contrast between President Trump's public statements concerning general antitrust policy and the views of his closest antitrust advisors, including his choice to lead the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, only adds to the ambiguity.When looking at President Trump's advisors and transition team, however, a clearer picture begins to emerge of an antitrust enforcement landscape that resembles that of George W. Bush.The question of how to preserve and encourage innovation through antitrust has become increasingly important to high-tech industries that possess a great deal of intellectual property (IP), such as in the pharmaceutical and chemicals sectors. With large mergers being contemplated in these industries, the need to preserve innovation has become of particular concern.Regulation of ""research and development markets"", previously known as ""innovation markets"", is controversial. There is disagreement whether the government should attempt to regulate competition in research and development at all.Even in specific cases, it is difficult to show through economic evidence that a particular IP licensing arrangement or merger will have an effect on innovation across a particular sector.For instance, market share, a factor that weighs heavily in the DOJ and FTC's antitrust enforcement decisions in product and service markets, may not be very predictive when asking whether a certain merger will lessen innovation.On the opposing side, there's still a substantial segment of antitrust enforcers who believe that regulating competition in R&D is necessary because competition drives innovation, and monopoly power in intellectual property would lessen incentives for companies to innovate at all.President Trump's personal feelings regarding specific companies and mergers, however, may not indicate the administration's policies as a whole. Trump's pick to lead the DOJ's Antitrust Division, White House deputy counsel Makan Delrahim, strongly indicates that the Trump administration will return to Bush-era policies.Delrahim has extensive antitrust and IP experience, including a stint in the DOJ's Antitrust division as deputy assistant attorney general. Whereas other members of Trump's antitrust transition team pushed for stronger economic analysis in antitrust enforcement, Delrahim has suggested that antitrust enforcement also needs an infusion of technical expertise to guide analysis of new and emerging high-tech markets.At his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned against the DOJ imposing merger conditions that are politically motivated, rather than conditions related to the merger itself. Attorney General Jeff Session's general record suggests a more lax approach to antitrust merger review.Trump advisor Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist, has argued that monopolies are good for society, spur innovation and incentivize research and development.Meanwhile, another potential FTC candidate that has been mooted for an FTC post, is Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who has limited antitrust experience but has been critical of the dominance of certain companies in the high-tech market.President Trump's point-person during the transition on the FTC, former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright, may also be instructive in how the Trump administration will tackle antitrust issues in R&D.Professor Wright is a strong proponent of the conservative Chicago School economic approach to antitrust, which takes a very permissive attitude to enforcement in general, asserting that markets themselves tend to regulate competition best, and that hard economic evidence should form the only basis for an antitrust challenge.Since challenges on innovation grounds are highly speculative, Chicago School adherents are extremely wary of any attempt to impose antitrust liability on R&D markets.In addition, President Trump designated Maureen K. Ohlhausen as Acting Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in January, and she is thought to be a leading candidate for the chairman position.A Republican veteran of the FTC with strong support from conservative groups, Ohlhausen, like Wright, is wary of government overreach and concerned about costs imposed on businesses by antitrust enforcement that is not based on hard economic evidence.In addition, she's been critical of the FTC's enforcement of intellectual property and patent rights, although she expressed support for the revised Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of IP.These senior advisors suggest that under the new administration enforcement in R&D may significantly lessen. This would be good news for pending agrochemical mergers and sharing-economy platforms.In general, their approach to R&D seems to be that in the absence of specific knowledge or accepted theory, antitrust enforcers should refrain from predicting the competitive significance of new products in a particular market.Under the Trump administration, mergers in high tech industries may not have to defend against accusations that there might be a potential reduction in R&D, and participants in new and innovative markets may have less to fear from potential new antitrust regulation and enforcement.

351,IP,"Boston Scientific (BSX) said Thursday it plans to acquire Swiss firm Symetis in a $435 million deal in that will deepen its heart-valve rivalry with Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Symetis offers several transcatheter aortic valve replacement products in Europe and internationally. This would add to Boston's Lotus heart-valve device which, in late February, was recalled due to mechanical issues.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, be earnings accretive in 2018 and hit 10% return on interest by the third year, Boston said in a presentation. Boston also reiterated its plan to launch its Lotus heart-valve device in the U.S. in 2018. The device is expected to return to European markets later this year.""We believe that this is an offensive rather than a defensive move,"" Needham analyst Mike Matson said. ""We do not believe this is a 'stopgap' to address the Lotus recall, shortcomings with Lotus or IP (intellectual property) issues.""Matson kept his buy rating and 29 price target on Boston Scientific stock. Boston shares finished regular trading down 1.1% to 24.45 on the stock market today following the announcement. Boston has been under pressure recently amid a patent battle with Edwards.Shares fell 2.7% on Feb. 23 after Boston voluntarily recalled its Lotus heart-valve device. The company discovered a mechanical issue that led to the premature release of a pin before doctors could implant the device. One patient died during an attempt to replace a Lotus heart valve.IBD'S TAKE: It's not the first time Boston Scientific has made an acquisition to help it in its battle against Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences, both of which already have transcatheter aortic heart valve devices in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders to see how this rivalry is shaping up.Boston sees Symetis as complementary to Lotus and ""would have done the deal even if Lotus were not to have been recalled,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a note to clients.""For investors concerned on whether Symetis' acquisition implies Lotus could be further delayed, this should provide reassurance,"" he said.Symetis is also unlikely to trigger more patent issues with Edwards, Kumar said. Per the patent, it doesn't appear Symetis works with supporting beams or locking mechanisms in its heart-valve replacements. Both are being contested by Edwards.RELATED:Medtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': AnalystBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Edwards, MedtronicMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The Benefits

""More specifically, senior management is now being paid bonuses on two criteria: relative earnings per share (EPS) growth, and relative total stock returns.""Looking ahead, we are assuming greed is a good thing and that this new executive compensation plan will drive shareholder-friendly behavior in terms of focus on ROIC (return on invested capital), EPS growth (presumably great for buybacks) and total share price return (both earnings growth and rising dividends over time).""The Irvine, Calif.-based company's infrastructure/networking and broadband businesses should deliver ""high-single-digit and low-digit growth, respectively,"" Muse said. ""These are businesses with deep competitive moats that should sustain not only 5%-plus growth but also gross margins in the high 50s going forward. Layer in adjacent market opportunities that can largely take advantage of the company's current IP portfolio, and we see Broadcom growing 5% over time despite near-term headwind from a declining connectivity business.""Broadcom reiterated that it decided to exit the cellular market because the economics had deteriorated for that sector.""The key question ... is when will the market treat Broadcom like the next Prologis (PLD) or high-performance analog name and the consequent 18+x forward P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple? If we compare Broadcom stock progression since its announced departure from the cellular business and map that vs. Texas Instruments (TXN), we see a clear path to $55,"" Muse wrote.Broadcom in June said it would exit the market for cellular baseband chips, which are used inside smartphones and tablets to convert radio frequency waves into the digital language of Os and 1s.RELATED:Intel, Qualcomm Eye China's Booming Mobile Market.

377,IP,"Internet: The U.S. quietly approved a plan Thursday to deliver oversight of the internet gatekeeping functions from the U.S. government to a private group. It's been hailed as ""privatizing"" the internet, but in fact it does no such thing.The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the Commerce Department, has given its stamp of approval to transfer oversight to a little-known, but mighty, Los Angeles-based private nonprofit group called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN.""The internet's multistakeholder community has risen to the challenge we gave them to develop a transition proposal that would ensure the internet's domain name system will continue to operate as seamlessly as it currently does,"" said Lawrence Strickling, NTIA's administrator, in a statement.If that's the case, why object to the government handing off something to the private sector? Well, that's not really what's happening.That phrase ""multistakeholder community"" is the problem. ICANN will be prone to influence from many parts, including 160 foreign governments and perhaps even some highly questionable nongovernmental organizations.ICANN already manages the domain naming and IP address systems and, by most accounts, does a fine job. This would give it de facto regulatory control as well.The internet is one of the few places where, with some notable exceptions, free speech still reigns supreme. If some of the rest of that ""multistakeholder community"" doesn't like that, what's to keep it from exerting enormous pressure on ICANN to regulate away free exchange on the internet?To keep this from happening, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (You wondered what he was up to since he stopped his campaign? Now you know.) and Wisconsin Sen. Sean Duffy have introduced a bill to halt transferring the internet domain name system away from the U.S. government unless Congress explicitly authorizes it.""The Obama administration is months away from deciding whether the United States government will continue to provide oversight over core functions of the internet and protect it from authoritarian regimes that view the internet as a way to increase their influence and suppress freedom of speech,"" Cruz said in a statement.The Protecting Internet Freedom Act also gives the U.S. sole control over the .gov and .mil domains.As Fox News noted, this attempt to give the ""global internet community"" more say dates back years. It sounds very nice, but in fact few nations have the same standards of open expression and freedom of speech as the U.S. Giving them what amounts to a veto over global internet policy isn't merely unwise; in a world of cyberwarfare and malicious hacking, it's downright dangerous.Cruz put it best in a prescient op-ed written three years ago:""The likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Chinese President Xi Jinping should not dictate what can be read, written, distributed, bought and sold on the internet,"" the former presidential candidate wrote. ""Countries that do not give their own people the right to speak freely deserve no say in what Americans can say and do on the internet.""Nor is this solely about freedom of speech. ICANN already charges fees to users. What happens when it's free to raise fees with no oversight?As Rick Manning of Americans For Limited Government noted recently, ""nonprofit"" ICANN had $219 million in revenue last year. When other countries gain clout, ""it is guaranteed that they will seek to grab the pot of gold through a U.N. structure that would more directly benefit them and increase their power.""The Cruz-Duffy bill is a good one. This needs to be stopped. The internet isn't a tchotchke to be handed over to those who don't value freedom or individual rights.

378,IP,"Ambarella (AMBA) stock jumped late Thursday after the GoPro (GPRO) supplier reported fiscal Q1 sales that edged the consensus and squeaked out a 6-cent earnings beat despite the two-year delay between releases of new Hero action cameras.In after-hours trading following its fiscal Q1 earnings release, Ambarella stock was up 11%, after rising 2.3%, to 42.48, in Thursday's regular session. But shares are down 24% for the year as GoPro inventory climbs ahead of the expected September launch of its new action camera, the Hero 5.For its fiscal Q1 ended April 30, Ambarella reported $57.2 million in sales and 34 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 19.5% and 52% vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus of 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters modeled $57.01 million and 28 cents.Ambarella had guided to $55 million to $57 million in sales. That guidance, says Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson, likely discounts any GoPro impact. GoPro demand ticked down in May and retailers have discounted the Hero 4 camera ahead of the new Hero 5.Ambarella didn't provide current-quarter guidance. Analyst consensus calls for $69.01 million in sales and 44 cents EPS ex items, down 22% and 50%.CEO Fermi Wang acknowledged headwinds in the wearable sports camera market and told investors to expect ""adverse impact"" from the Japanese earthquake in April, which disrupted supply of Sony image sensors.""We remain confident of renewed revenue growth based on our technology leadership, product road map and the potential of our current and future markets,"" Wang said in a statement.

379,IP,"Diagnosed with Parkinson's in his 50s, Gary's hallucinations began slowly -- first, a leak that didn't exist, then imaginary cats frolicking throughout his house. They quickly escalated, until Gary called the cops after a terrifying delusion in which a stranger assaulted his wife.Ten million people worldwide have Parkinson's  -- and as many as 50% of them suffer from delusions and hallucinations. But there's hope: Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved a groundbreaking new medication to treat Parkinson's-related hallucinations and delusions, a treatment that mutes the visions without exacerbating the other motor symptoms.Such life-changing breakthroughs are possible because of America's extensive protections for intellectual property. These protections grant companies a period of market exclusivity for original products, providing an incentive for companies and their investors to invest billions in research and development of the next generation of breakthrough medications.Unfortunately, however, an obscure United Nations body called the High Level Panel on Access to Medicines seems poised to hack away at protection for intellectual property worldwide. This would be a tragedy for millions of ailing patients around the world hoping for a breakthrough, life-saving cure.Established last year by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to improve global access to life-saving medications, the Panel began its work from a biased and wrong-headed premise. The UN Panel seems to view intellectual-property rights as the problem, not the solution. Indeed, it was tasked with ""remedying the policy incoherence between the justifiable rights of inventors ... and public health.""This approach assumes that intellectual property protections -- which allow the inventor alone to manufacture a product or license it for a set period of time -- are a problem. Nothing could be further from the truth.What it simply ignores is how huge an undertaking it is to create a new drug. On average, in the United States, it takes $2.6 billion -- and roughly 10 years of research and clinical testing -- before a new medication can reach consumers.  Just one in eight drugs that makes it to a clinical trial makes it to market.No investor or developer would be willing to take such an enormous financial risk without a firm guarantee that the hard work could pay off. Intellectual-property protection is that guarantee.The United States has some of the strongest intellectual-property protections in the world -- and the value of them is self-evident. Right now, 7,000 drugs are in research and development worldwide. More than 70% of them began in U.S. laboratories.  Internationally, the United States is responsible for well over half of all new medications created in the past decade.Without IP protections, the investor math of medical research and development becomes impossible. If the UN Panel gets what it appears to want, the current generation of new medications could be the last generation of new medications.Furthermore, the High Level Panel's attempt to pin lack of access on patent and other intellectual property rights is, in fact, bizarre. The reality is that 350 of the 375 medications the World Health Organization deems ""essential"" are no longer subject to patents. That means they are available for generic production for the taking. Logically speaking, intellectual property protection can't be responsible for lack of access when there is no intellectual property protection.With its bogus and dangerous premise, the UN is conveniently side-stepping the real problems in access to medicine. For instance, in South Africa there is little to no road access to remote areas.  Developing countries also face a serious shortage of healthcare professionals. Africa claims only 2.3 healthcare workers per 1,000 population. The United States has 25.As the U.S. State Department recently noted, the Panel is ""examining only pieces of the larger puzzle, and will be doing so in isolation."" Such a narrow approach is sure to be ""imbalanced and of limited use, or even counterproductive.""The true global interest here is in finding the newest, best cures and treatments for ailments like Parkinson's. The UN Panel is acting on a fundamentally flawed premise. Instead of working to erode Intellectual Property rights, the UN panel should be looking at ways to incentivize innovation, promote research and development, and stop villainizing the people who are currently working on the next generation of live-saving medications.

380,IP,"GoPro (GPRO) chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) is expected late Thursday to report its first-ever year-over-year sales decline on GoPro's two-year delay between launches of its Hero sports-action cameras.The ""pause in front of GoPro Hero 5 is becoming more pronounced,"" Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson said Wednesday. GoPro launched its Hero 4 in September 2014, but has held off on releasing the camera's successor until this year.Now, retailers are offering steep Hero 4 discounts as GoPro likely phases it out, Erickson wrote in a research report. Month over month, GoPro demand in the U.S. has ticked down through May, and inventory increased to 26 days from 20, he says.Investors expect a flat fiscal 2017 for Ambarella, but the consensus of 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models a 21% sequential climb in the July quarter, offsetting a 20% fiscal Q1 decline.For fiscal Q1 ended on or near April 30, Ambarella is expected to report $57.01 million in sales and 28 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 20% and 61% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Ambarella has guided to $55 million to $57 million in sales.That guidance likely doesn't reflect much GoPro impact, Erickson wrote.""With that said, we believe the company may need Hero 5 builds to begin in the latter part of the July quarter in order to meet the Street's expectation for over 20% sequential growth,"" he wrote.Long term, Ambarella's exposure to drones, consumer IP security, wearable cameras and automotive segments should help it weather the action-camera downfall, Erickson wrote. He reiterated an overweight rating and 53 price target on Ambarella stock.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Ambarella stock was down a fraction, near 41. GoPro stock was flat, above 10. Once highfliers, Ambarella and GoPro stocks are 68% and 90% off their July 2015 and October 2014 highs.Shares of Ambarella are down more than 25% this year, while GoPro is down more than 40%, and both are ranked by IBD in the bottom 55 of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.

381,IP,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) is quickly deleveraging and might pursue M&A before year's end, MKM analyst Ian Ing said Friday, days after Broadcom's name was again thrown into the theoretical bidder hat for Xilinx (XLNX).Xilinx stock rose by 5.7% Tuesday on rumors that it had received a $15 billion bid from an unidentified source. Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are often rumored suitors, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri sees NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as a better target for Qualcomm.""The Broadcom story largely revolves around a quick deleverage and return to semiconductor consolidation via accretive deals, possibly by calendar year 2016 exit,"" Ing wrote Friday in a research report.Recently, Broadcom tucked-in 5G modulation firm MagnaCom, in a $50 million acquisition. It also sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) to ""help reduce debt and monetize"" its discontinued operations, Ing wrote.After the market close Thursday, Broadcom is slated to report its first quarterly earnings results following its January merger with Avago. The former Avago bought classic Broadcom for $37 billion, keeping the Broadcom name and AVGO stock ticker.For its fiscal Q2 ended on or near April 30, Broadcom is expected to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 116% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS will slightly accelerate from 8% growth in the prior quarter but won't hit December 2015 levels.Long term, Broadcom and other chips combos are at risk of Apple's penchant for sourcing from suppliers ""that have an easier path to full integration,"" Ing wrote. Broadcom is about 14% exposed to Apple, providing some $4-$5 of content per iPhone.""Apple's second-sourcing of modem chips via Intel (INTC) may be an interim step toward full integration centered around the (Apple) Ax-series applications processor,"" Ing wrote. Intel is more open to implementing third-party apps processor IP than is Qualcomm, he says.""An Apple single-chip integration comparable to Qualcomm's Snapdragon would save package, test and assembly costs as well as power consumption,"" Ing wrote.It wouldn't be the first time that Apple has used dual component suppliers. The iPhone 6S contained A9 processors from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung.Samsung reportedly yielded to Taiwan Semi for the iPhone 7 processor.Broadcom stock rose a fraction Friday, to 153.30, and IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group also rose a fraction. Broadcom stock is up 5% for the year vs. a 2% climb for the group.Broadcom stock is working on a cup-type base, with a possible buy point of 159.75.

Its sights are set on a wealth of other opportunities.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarella is targeting its video-capturing and image-processing chips to the growing home monitor and professional security camera market. The company also is after applications for car dashboards and rear-view mirrors, and cameras mounted on drones and quadcopters.""Ambarella differentiates itself by enabling high-quality video and efficient compression of that video, while using the lowest possible amount of power,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy told IBD. ""These three capabilities can continue to expand video applications into many untapped markets.""Its chips support 4K ultrahigh-definition video at 30 frames per second, three years ahead of the competition.""'Left Fairly Convinced'At Ambarella's analyst meeting in September, Cassidy says attendees saw opportunities for Ambarella beyond its role as the exclusive video processor supplier for San Mateo, Calif.-based GoPro.""Many investors started the meetings rather skeptical of Ambarella's market opportunities but left fairly convinced the company is poised to outgrow the video market,"" Cassidy said.Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang discussed growth markets in a conference call with analysts on Sept. 4. He cited potential in home monitoring and professional security camera applications enabled by cloud-based video storage, as well as remote viewing via smartphones and tablets.Another growth area is wearable police cameras, Wang says, because Ambarella's chip technology provides high-definition recording with clear images even in low-light conditions, and enables low-power operation to extend battery life.""These (police) security cameras support continuous video recording of events, offering protection and documentation for both the police and the public,"" Wang said at the time.Wang looks for the U.S. wearable camera market to expand as the cameras are employed by fire departments, security guards and other emergency responders.Sales of wearable sports cameras are increasing at an annual rate of 59%, according to market tracker Juniper Research.It forecasts industry sales of $19 billion in 2018, up from just $1.4 billion in 2012.Wang says he met GoPro CEO Nick Woodman five years ago at the Consumer Electronics Show. Ambarella and GoPro have worked on cameras that can withstand the elements, absorb impact and run for hours while capturing vivid video in many operating modes.GoPro 25%-30% Of RevenueBut while Ambarella benefits from GoPro's top market position, deriving such a large portion of business from one customer poses a risk, said David Williams, an analyst with Ascendiant Capital Markets.Williams estimates GoPro accounted for 25%-30%, or $11.75 million to $14.1 million, of the $47 million in revenue Ambarella generated in its fiscal Q2 ended July 31.Williams and other analysts see growth for Ambarella in the auto segment and in high-definition broadcasting, because the 10-year-old company's compression chips help broadcasters transmit their programs worldwide.Wang says its latest chips enable a new generation of dashboard cameras that capture high-quality images even at night, and with Wi-Fi. Such improvements allow users to connect, stream live and record footage directly to mobile devices to view instantly or share.Ambarella's technology has a ""surround view"" capability that lets it stitch together video from cameras on both sides of a car, resulting in a high-definition ""aerial"" view, Cassidy says.In March, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued new regulations requiring all vehicles weighing less than 10,000 pounds to be equipped with rear visibility cameras by May 2018.In Korea, car camera manufacturer Thinkware has introduced video cameras that record via the windshield and rear windows, using Ambarella chips.""We can see this application in early stages for developing driver assistance in lane mergers, spaces between vehicles, etc.,"" Cassidy said.In the security market, analog cameras connected to co-axial cables are being replaced with digital cameras, which encode video inside the camera and transmit it over a network. Ambarella technology enables video to be compressed 30% or more than earlier chips, speeding transmission. It also requires 30% less storage, 30% less processing power and 30% less bandwidth for transmission than earlier chips, Cassidy says.As businesses, government agencies, airports and consumers add security cameras to networks, Ambarella's compression technology will help facilitate the process of transmitting and analyzing the video, Cassidy says.About 45% of Ambarella's business is now in IP security cameras, he says, making that market ""a bigger growth engine than GoPro.""""We are estimating 40% year-over-year growth for Ambarella's IP security revenue,"" Cassidy said.At a trade show in April in Las Vegas, IP security camera and thermal image supplier Flir Systems (FLIR) introduced 31 new camera models with Ambarella's chips.Surveillance camera maker Hikvision rolled out panoramic security cameras at the conference that can be mounted in walls or ceilings to provide a 360-degree or 180-degree field of view. And global security camera manufacturer Lorex introduced its Little Link portable, high-definition Wi-Fi video baby monitor. Hikvision and Lorex use Ambarella chips.Research firm IHS estimates the total available market for commercial IP security cameras at 60 million units and rising 30% a year.In another market, consumer drones typically fly at more than 20 miles per hour.At that speed, and adding in the height, video cameras must be capable of the high resolutions that Ambarella's chips deliver, Cassidy says.""We believe commercial applications for drones will expand and become the new high-end market for Ambarella's video processors,"" Cassidy said. ""We are now including drone-related revenue in our fiscal year 2016 estimates.""

435,IP,"Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is taking steps to capitalize on the growing e-sports trend.On Thursday, Activision announced the launch of its e-sports broadcast network, as part of the recently acquired Major League Gaming platform. It also revealed new content and broadcast experiences, as well as a distribution partnership with Facebook (FB).“This marks an important step given Activision’s broader ambitions as a media/entertainment company, and is a natural evolution of the Major League Gaming assets acquired early this year,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report Thursday. “E-sports is still in its infancy (think fantasy football 20 years ago) and represents significant near- and long-term incremental monetization opportunities given Activision Blizzard’s portfolio of owned-IP.”Sebastian rates Activision stock as outperform, with a price target of 42. Activision stock rose 1% to 38.29 on the stock market today, more than 9% extended from a 34.76 buy point, touched April 13, out of a cup-with-handle base.The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company presented its Activision Blizzard Media Network plan for advertisers at the IAB Digital Content NewFronts 2016 conference in New York.ABMN will launch the new content and broadcast experiences during the MLG Anaheim Open, a two-day “Call of Duty: Black Ops 3” tournament beginning on June 10. It will be available for live streaming through Facebook.“E-sports could become a meaningful revenue and profit contributor to Activision within 2-3 years, as the company monetizes its IP (intellectual property) and product portfolio across alternative distribution channels,” Sebastian said.Baird predicts the e-sports industry will grow from $200 million last year to $1 billion in 2018 and $1.8 billion in 2020.“We see a significant opportunity with tournaments, advertising/sponsorship, broadcasting, and fantasy/wagering, contributing incrementally to game publisher revenues and earnings,” Sebastian said.Other companies pursuing e-sports initiatives include Time Warner’s (TWX) Turner Sports and talent management agency WME-IMG, which have partnered on E-League, a “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive” league.On Wednesday, Turner and WME-IMG announced the first group of brands to join E-League as official marketing partners.

"
436,IP,"Walt Disney's (DIS) decision to end its Infinity interactive toy and video game product line could provide a lift to rivals in the toys-to-life business, namely Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX).Disney announced Tuesday that it is getting out of the self-published video game business and canceling its Infinity game series. Disney took a $147 million charge to its fiscal-second-quarter results to close the division.Disney's Infinity exit leaves Activision's Skylanders, Warner's Lego Dimensions and Nintendo's (NTDOY) Amiibo in the toys-to-life games segment. The toys-to-life genre involves the use of figurines or action figures that are placed on a small platform to interact with on-screen play for game consoles.“Disney’s announcement that they are exiting the toys-to-life category in a production capacity creates some interesting opportunities,” Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a report Thursday. “First, we think it paves the way for a significant bounce back in Skylanders sales this year; second, we suspect the Disney IP (intellectual property) will eventually wind up as part of WB’s Lego Dimensions franchise.”Toys-to-life video game sales, excluding sales of stand-alone toys, peaked in 2013 with the launch of Infinity, Creutz said. The category declined 20% in 2014 and was flat in 2015, he said.Nintendo launched Amiibo toys in 2014, but it doesn’t have a stand-alone game like Infinity, Skylanders and Lego Dimensions. Amiibo toys are integrated into existing Nintendo games.“With Activision now the only player planning to launch a toys-to-life game in 2016 (there will be some Dimensions playsets but no new game), if the category remains flat, Skylanders could grow by as much as 300%,” Creutz said. “This would be a source of surprise upside to Activision’s guidance.""In any case, the elimination of a competitor can only be a positive for both Activision and WB’s profitability from the category.”Cowen rates Activision stock outperform, with a price target of 44. Activision stock rose 2.2% to 37.91 on the stock market today. The shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 34.76 buy point on April 13.Cowen rates Disney and Time Warner stocks as market perform.

437,IP,"Nike (NKE) has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars.The athletic gear maker was granted about 500 patents last year and ended 2015 with 5,060 issued patents, which include those that expired, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). That tops Lockheed Martin (LMT) (4,113), Ford Motor (F) (3,563) and Pfizer (PFE) (2,587). And that doesn’t even include patent applications.Nike’s patents have nearly doubled since 2009, and CEO Mark Parker boasted last year the company has the third-largest U.S. portfolio of design patents. Nike has buried rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UA) in patents, as it looks to maintain its dominance with an avalanche of innovations in manufacturing and design while potentially toying with a wearable device that could appear alongside Apple's (AAPL) smartwatches and Fitbit's (FIT) trackers.""Generally, you should see some type of correlation when a company is releasing innovative, game-changing products,” said Envision IP Managing Attorney Maulin Shah, who said that of Nike’s thousands of granted patents, over 4,200 of them are still active and in force.As Nike doubles down on automation and 3D printing capabilities, a recent Macquarie analysis of the USPTO library observed “a meaningful acceleration of (Nike) patents in recent months focusing on new ways to manufacture products.”Nike already has its own army of shoe-painting and water-free dyeing robots, just to name a few. And in October, it announced a partnership with Flextronics (FLEX), a manufacturer that has developed an automated way to cut material waste by 50%. Such savings, if flowed to the bottom line, could add 23 cents to Nike's 2016 earnings per share, Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu estimated in April.Separately, Nike is building a “3D digital design system” in partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) that includes “nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultra-rapid prototyping.”Compared to Nike's more than 4,200 active patents, German rival Adidas has “kind of been stagnant,” with a U.S. patent portfolio that is about a ninth the size of Nike’s, not including those gained in its acquisition of golf equipment maker TaylorMade, said Shah. But Adidas does have a “relatively large” patent portfolio in Europe, he noted. Globally, Nike has about 19,500 patents and patent applications vs. Adidas’ roughly 2,400.Under Armour, which has been happy to be framed as a tech company with a penchant for snapping up fitness apps, only has about 104 issued U.S. patents, almost two-thirds of which are design and not utility patents, by Shah's count. Utility patents in athletic apparel primarily deal with material -- think compression, moisture-wicking -- and manufacturing methods vs. patents for clothing designs.Innovation aside, patents can also be an indicator for something far juicier: a peek into a company’s product strategy.For example, Under Armour was granted on March 29 a patent for a one-armed compression sleeve designed to warm a pitcher’s throwing arm between innings -- an interestingly specific item that indicated potential future investments in baseball. Indeed, a few weeks later, the company signed Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP, to what ESPN said is the biggest endorsement deal ever for a baseball player, though terms weren't disclosed.Source: USPTOWhile most of Nike's recent patent activity is related to manufacturing, a dive into its sprawling portfolio indicates a potential shift in its device strategy.Nike hasn’t been in the wearables business since axing most of its FuelBand team two years ago, and the TomTom-powered Nike+ Sportwatch is no more. Nike instead has been pushing its revamped Nike+ app over any hardware.Some have said the athletic apparel giant is shying away from hardware development because of its partnership with Apple, particularly since its Nike+ app can be used on the Apple Watch. But its patents say otherwise.There has been a ""surge"" in wearable-related applications from Nike in the last two or three years, Shah said, and the company now has 261 active patents related to wearable tech vs. Adidas' 99 and Under Armour's dozen patents.Published with the USPTO recently, images from a patent for an “athletic watch” look an awful lot like the TomTom version of Nike’s watch: a boxy-looking accessory with a perforated band and large numbers. In fact, given the slight aesthetic differences -- an extra button here, a missing button there, a thinner wristband -- the drawings could easily be a newer edition of the Nike+ SportWatch, though it is not clear if that is the case.Both Nike and TomTom did not immediately respond to a request for comment..Source: USPTO“It definitely seems that Nike is keeping its options open on this front,” Macquarie's Vasilescu told IBD after viewing an earlier trio of patent applications for an athletic watch that were published on March 17 and first filed last September.Meanwhile, about 20% of Adidas’ patents are focused on wearables. But such products may never come to market, Shah said, noting that companies also license ideas if they aren't in a position to make gadgets themselves.Given the sheer number of applications that are filed with the USPTO each year – 629,647 in 2015 alone – some might consider it folly to think digging through musty government archives might shed any light on what kind of consumer products could hit shelves.Indeed, trying to decipher a company’s product pipeline by looking at the U.S. patent library is a little bit like astronomy -- both constellations and published patents are maps of the past. Starlight has to travel so far to reach Earth that some of those celestial bodies that appear to be burning in the night sky may already be dead, or dying.Similarly, it takes about 24.6 months on average for filed patent applications to be published on the USPTO database, according to the agency. Most are actually published within a year and a half, Santa Clara University School of Law Assistant Professor Brian Love told IBD, though ideas were conceived and worked on well before a filing.“It’s probably at least two years old, if not more, and then by the time the patent issues, you’re talking about tacking on a couple more years on top of that,"" he said. ""So it is kind of a window into the future, but it’s not that far of a window into the future.”Still, filings can offer clues years in advance. Case in point: Nike rolled out self-lacing Marty McFly-inspired shoes in March, after Nike designer Tinker Hatfield confirmed in early 2014 that power lacing would be unveiled the following year. But the company's “Back to the Future” resurrection could've been foreseen long before that. Nike's first granted patent for an “automatic lacing system” appeared in 2011.Of course, some companies stake out IP turf not for the purpose of developing those ideas, but to thwart competitors’ dreams. This type of defensive patent publishing, as it is known, is not uncommon with tech giants like IBM (IBM) or Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, say experts.“The consequence of publishing something is that you lose any sort of trade secrets rights you might have in it, but you’re also stopping somebody else from patenting it,” said Love.Watchmaker Swatch has reportedly been on a smartwatch-patent filing spree over the last few years. What it intends to do with them is a mystery.“There’s a lot of rumors in the patent industry: Will Swatch start suing competitors, or are they actually just building up patents because they’re about to launch an entirely new product line?” said Shah.Regardless, no matter what Nike, Under Armour or Adidas wind up bringing to market, all of this patent-filing and R&D means that investors and consumers can likely expect growth from the activewear space.“I think we are in the golden age of tech in the athletic footwear business,” said NPD Group analyst Matt Powell. “I have never seen so many new tech advances (in products and manufacturing) that we are currently seeing. So add that to the fact that there’s a record number of patents and the future looks really bright.”

438,IP,"Walt Disney (DIS) missed second-quarter expectations late Tuesday, sending shares gapping down out of buy range Wednesday, closing down 4%.But is it all bad news? Here are a few takeaways from the media conglomerate's earnings call.IBD's Take: How sturdy is the House of Mouse? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFewer sports fans are paying for ESPN (again), but Disney's pay-TV situation is perhaps not as dire as once perceived, thanks to ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and on the Sony (SNE) PlayStation.""The numbers on both of those platforms have been encouraging, and they were a driver of (subscribers),"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said on the earnings call late Tuesday. ""They did contribute incremental subs for ESPN this last quarter."" He added that current and new distributors have an ""avid interest"" in including ESPN in their packages.Disney's 10-Q filing for the quarter notes subscriber declines having a 1% revenue impact to its media networks division, down from a 2% impact in its fiscal first quarter. Cable networks, (including ESPN and others) and broadcasting (including ABC) make up the media networks division.""These trends suggest some deceleration of subscriber declines, likely related to positive momentum coming from Sling TV and to a lesser extent Sony Vue,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to so-called ""skinny bundle"" packages involving a few select channels. Meyers reiterated his overweight rating on the belief that ""the upcoming film slate will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN.""Media networks revenue, which was flat from the prior year's second quarter, was ""largely in line (with my expectations) and, more importantly, largely in line on the affiliate (revenue) front,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, who rates Disney a buy.Revenue from both the cable networks unit and greater media networks segments slightly missed Wall Street consensus, according to Stifel, but analysts didn't seem to mind much -- in stark contrast to the previous quarter's call.Once in the shadow of Netflix (NFLX), Hulu garnered some attention in the wake of news that it will launch a live-TV package next year that will include broadcast and cable channels, as well as live sports and news.""Hulu's become an important investment for us, not just as a distributor of the programs that we make, but ultimately as a buyer of original product and ultimately as a distributor of our channels"" Iger said during the call, billing it as a ""best of cable"" middle-ground option between a bigger package and a Sling-style skinny bundle.The streaming service is a ""key strategic asset for Fox (FOXA) and Disney and one which allows for greater ad monetization over time but, more importantly, is expected to continue to bridge the product gap between MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) service and OTT (over-the-top) services,"" Mogil wrote in a separate note.Iger refrained from commenting on Disney's plans for subscription video-on-demand, except to say that it will keep investing in the creation of intellectual property.""One of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on two of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix,"" he said, adding that Marvel has also ""been in discussions"" with other distributors.Netflix shares were down 2.6% Wednesday.Separately, he said the value of Disney's IP in China ""is on the rise."" The soon-to-be-opened Shanghai Disney Resort will feature Marvel characters, and characters from the Disney animated film ""Zootopia"" will pop up in the park ""sooner than we had initially anticipated,"" said Iger, due to the movie's success in China.""In general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property, as well as a blend of some original intellectual property too,"" he said.Disney's IP flows through its various branches, as original characters become Disneyland attractions and toys that help the consumer products segment chug along.Spider-Man's return to the Marvel fold won't hurt, either. Marvel and Sony struck a deal last year to share the character, the top Marvel character from a merchandise perspective, said Iger. That means Disney probably expects fans to snap up Spider-Man toys and products next year when ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" hits theaters.

439,IP,"Electronic Arts (EA) stock rocketed higher on Wednesday, a day after the video game publisher reported better-than-expected March-quarter earnings, thanks to hot games like ""Star Wars Battlefront.""EA stock jumped 13.7% to 73.38 on the stock market today. The stock is at its loftiest point since touching an all-time intraday high of 76.92 on Oct. 29.The Redwood City, Calif.-based company said late Tuesday it earned 50 cents a share excluding items on sales of $924 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EA to earn 42 cents a share on sales of $889 million. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EPS rose 28%, and revenue inched up 3%.“We grew non-GAAP net revenue, profitability and cash flow to record highs,” Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in a statement. “Leveraging our great portfolio of brands and live services has enabled us to break records across our key financial metrics. We expect to drive strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth into the future.”EA credited “Star Wars Battlefront” and sports games, such as “Madden NFL 16"" and ""FIFA 16,” for its gains in Q4.For its current fiscal 2017, EA expects to earn $3.50 a share excluding items on sales of $4.9 billion. That compares with fiscal 2016 results of $3.14 EPS on sales of $4.57 billion.EA hopes to continue its strong performance with new games this year, such as “Mirror’s Edge Catalyst,” due out June 7, and “Battlefield 1,” set for release Oct. 21. Also in the pipeline are “Titanfall 2,” scheduled for fiscal Q3, and “Mass Effect: Andromeda,” set for late Q4.Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz maintained his buy rating on EA stock but raised his price target to 105 from 95.“We continue to believe EA is poised to benefit from numerous multiyear tailwinds, including fast sales of consoles and ever more direct-to-consumer digital downloads, which drive improved profitability,” Pitz said in a report.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey also reiterated his buy rating on EA and inched up his price target to 82.64 from 81.48.Key factors driving his enthusiasm for the company include expectations for continued sales and earnings growth, a compelling game slate ahead and growth of digital downloads and services, Hickey said.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his outperform rating on EA and 12-month price target of 86.“The company provided greater visibility into its long-term release schedule, expecting to launch at least one Star Wars title each year over the next three to four years,” he said in a report. “In fiscal 2018, it expects to launch a Star Wars Battlefront sequel.""In fiscal 2019, it expects to launch a Star Wars action game from Motive Studios and Visceral Games. It also expects to launch a Star Wars game from Respawn Entertainment, which we have penciled in for fiscal 2020. In addition to its Star Wars efforts, EA expects to launch a new, unannounced IP (intellectual property) in fiscal 2018.”Last week, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) reported better-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings, thanks to a boost from newly acquired mobile game publisher King Digital Entertainment.A third major video game publisher, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), is scheduled to report fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings on May 18.

467,IP,"Big biotech Biogen (BIIB) said Tuesday that it will spin off its hemophilia business into an independent company in a move much anticipated by Wall Street.Biogen, which focuses mainly on neurological diseases, got into hemophilia with the 2014 launch of its two long-acting infusion treatments, Eloctate and Alprolix, for hemophilia A and B, respectively. It carved out some market share from leader Baxter International (BAX), but in mid-April press reports relayed rumors that Biogen was thinking of selling or spinning off the business.Baxter had already made a similar move when it spun off its hemophilia-focused biopharma arm as Baxalta (BXLT) last July. Baxalta was quickly snapped up by Shire (SHPG) in a $32 billion deal.Both Baxalta's and Biogen's infusion therapies are under potential threat from new gene therapies that might be able to cure the disease with a one-time treatment, or at least manage it with far fewer treatments. BioMarin Pharmaceutical's (BMRN) early-stage trial results for its hemophilia gene therapy, reported last month, supported the method's potential.Biogen's press release mentioned that investment in research was one rationale for the spinoff.""The new company, to be named at a later date, will focus on the discovery and development of therapies for the treatment of hemophilia,"" said the release. ""The new company plans to bring longer-acting therapies utilizing the XTEN technology into clinical development in the first half of 2017 and to accelerate the development of bispecific antibodies and hemophilia-related gene therapy programs.""It added that the spinoff will also enable the remaining portion of Biogen to focus on its core multiple-sclerosis business, which has been struggling lately as shown in Biogen's Q1 earnings last month.Still, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee found the decision a bit puzzling.""Why would Biogen want to remove a growing and profitable, long-IP-duration biologics business that diversifies Biogen and 'dilutes' the EPS when it's removed?"" he asked in a research note. ""In addition, Biogen is not selling the business and bringing in cash (approximate $4 billion to $6 billion valuation), and prior to today, the question was what would they do with that cash and who would they buy (they aren't getting cash in this deal). So this seems odd and perhaps implies the valuation is not what the Street perceives if a buyer was not willing to pay up.""Biogen stock was up a fraction in early trading on the stock market today, near 275.

468,IP,"Earlier this month, a Florida man was sentenced to two years in prison for smuggling and selling counterfeit medicines from China. Over the last six years, his pharmacy made over $1 million dispensing knock-offs of popular prescriptions.This is the visible cost of intellectual property theft -- but the unseen costs are far greater. Fake medicines kill more than 1 million people each year. Plus, counterfeiters don't put their revenues toward discovering innovative new medicines. Every dollar that goes to the producer of a counterfeit is one that cannot be spent developing the next generation of cures.Strong IP laws protect consumers from those unseen costs. They encourage inventors -- entrepreneurs, artists, researchers, and more -- to take risks, innovate, and create valuable new products. When IP rights are weakened, whether by outright theft or unwise public policy, consumers lose access to the innovations that have yet to be created.American policymakers must protect intellectual property and trumpet its importance to our economy and way of life.Intellectual property is the engine that drives America's economy. It gives investors the confidence they need to finance research-intensive industries.According to economists from Tufts, Duke, and the University of Rochester, it takes $2.6 billion to develop a new medicine and bring it to market. But it's not just the pharmaceutical industry that invests heavily in research and development. In 2014, Intel poured nearly $11 billion into R&D. Samsung spent more than $13 billion.Only because of strong IP laws do investors have any chance of recouping those staggering costs.IP laws don't just generate economic rewards for investors. They're the foundation for cultural innovation. For both the struggling bar band and Taylor Swift, the first-time filmmaker and Martin Scorsese alike, IP rights ensure that a creator has a legal claim to the product of his or her mind. Indeed, HBO just announced that it won't send advance copies of Game of Thrones to the media because of counterfeiting concerns.Without the assurances IP laws provide, innovators would be far less likely to take the risks and invest the time and money necessary to create the next breakthrough technology, labor-saving service, or medical advance.Unsurprisingly, intellectual property is America's most valuable resource.Collectively, America's IP is worth $5.8 trillion. That figure is $2 trillion greater than the entire output of the German economy.Every year, IP-based industries become more important to the U.S. economy. Businesses that rely on these protections to safeguard their inventions are responsible for nearly three-quarters of our exports. All told, these traded products and services are worth almost $1 trillion.Innovative industries also benefit workers. Over 40 million Americans are currently employed in an IP-intensive sector. These are positions that pay well, with average wages that are 42% higher than those paid by other industries, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.These are also the jobs of the future. Over the next decade, IP-sector employment is expected to grow much faster than the overall American labor market.Other countries have caught onto the tremendous economic and cultural benefits the United States has reaped from strong IP laws and have started to reform their legal systems to mimic ours.On April 26, the United Nations is hosting World Intellectual Property Day to reinforce the value of IP protections in a global economy. This year's theme, ""Digital Creativity: Culture Reimagined,"" will focus on creating an IP system that rewards artists without stifling the cross-pollination of ideas inherent to creativity.Indonesia, for instance, passed a law in 2014 creating an online notification system for a rights-holder to request legal action against infringers. Israel has installed significantly more robust IP rights for biopharmaceuticals. And the United Arab Emirates has introduced serious measures to crack down on media piracy.These moves are laudable. American policymakers should urge other countries to follow this path.World IP Day is an opportunity for leaders around the globe to recognize the importance of robust IP protections. A legal system that prizes IP fuels the economy and inspires innovators to create the breakthrough products and services that improve our lives.

469,IP,"TV patent giant Rovi (ROVI) on Friday announced a $1.1 billion deal to buy digital video recorder pioneer TiVo (TIVO) and adopt TiVo as its new corporate name.San Carlos, Calif.-based Rovi agreed to pay $10.70 a share in cash and stock for San Jose, Calif.-based TiVo. The acquisition had been rumored for several weeks.Rovi stock fell 1.6% to 17.62 on the stock market today. TiVo stock rose 5.9% to 9.98.“Rovi’s acquisition of TiVo, with its innovative products, talented team and substantial intellectual property portfolio, strengthens Rovi’s position as a global leader in media discovery, metadata, analytics and IP licensing,” Rovi CEO Tom Carson said in a statement. “It’s an exciting time as the media and entertainment landscape undergoes a significant evolution.""The combined capabilities of TiVo and Rovi place us in a tremendous position to extend services across platforms and to a customer base that includes traditional, over-the-top and emerging players across the globe.”Rovi has earned a reputation as a patent bully for its litigious behavior. This month, Rovi sued Comcast (CMCSA) for patent infringement after failing to come to terms on a new licensing agreement.Last year, Netflix (NFLX) successfully defended itself from a Rovi patent infringement lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge ruled that the five Rovi-owned patents it wielded against the streaming video company were invalid.Rovi holds more than 5,000 patents in areas such as digital entertainment guides, DVRs and on-demand programming. It generates the majority of its revenue through patent-licensing agreements with pay TV services. Once the TiVo acquisition closes, the combined company will have over 6,000 patents.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson looked favorably on the deal.“The rationale for the deal makes sense, with overlapping customers and organizational goals, and synergies that could make the combined business more profitable,” he said in a report Friday. “Specifically, the company is expecting $100 million of cost synergies and that the deal will be EPS accretive within the first 12 months.”Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Rovi stock with a price target of 29.Olson noted that litigation is a component of both companies’ business models.

470,IP,"This year, journalist Steve Petrow got his computer hacked while using the in-flight Wi-Fi service on American Airlines. He described the experience in a USAToday column, explaining that the hacker was another passenger aboard the plane who approached him at baggage claim. The hacker told the journalist he had read his emails on the flight, along with those of other passengers.The hacker, Petrow explained, wanted to show him what it was like to have his privacy violated, since Petrow had been writing about the Apple-FBI privacy issues.Point made. Indeed, when it comes to security, Wi-Fi can be trouble.Getting into data over a shared Wi-Fi network isn’t hard to do, says Josh Wright, a Providence, R.I.-based security consultant and author of “Hacking Exposed Wireless.”“When you join a Wi-Fi Network, and I can join that same network, I know that I can attack your computer,” Wright said. “And the Wi-Fi hot spot provider, whether it’s a coffee shop or whatever, really has no interest in providing additional security for you because that’s an added cost for them.”While Petrow’s hacker seemed to want to make a point about privacy, other hackers often have more nefarious plans:Gary Griffiths is CEO of iPass (IPAS), which offers a cloud-based service that helps people connect more easily and securely to Wi-Fi hot spots worldwide.  He identified several ways hackers can invade your privacy when your Wi-Fi network is not secure. These include:“From a settings point of view, once data is leaving your computer and going into the air, it can be intercepted,” Griffiths said. “So unless you’re doing something to encrypt that data, it is vulnerable.”There are safer ways to get on Wi-Fi when you’re away from home, says Wright. For example, if you are doing work for a company and have access to its Virtual Private Network, be sure to hook into it.“VPNs provide a layer of protection between your computer and your workplace. So now all your data goes out to your workplace, instead of going out unencrypted. It offers an extra level of security,” Wright said.If you’re self-employed, it becomes harder because there’s no big company VPN to hook into. But there are options.Here are a few that Wright, Griffiths and other experts suggest:Once you do get home, you can do several things to keep your data safe. One of them, says Wright, is to make sure your wireless router’s encryption is set to the Wireless Protection Access 2, or WPA2, standard. Contact the manufacturer if you need instructions on how to do this. (Some have the instructions on their websites.)And don’t give the network password out to many people, such as to friends or extended family, says Wright. If you do, try to change the password at least four times a year, or just let everyone outside your immediate family use your guest network.  It’s not protected like your home network, but people will have access if they want it.Also, make a backup of your data that is not connected to your computer, or even in the house. Wright says he backs up his family’s data (like photos they don’t want to lose) onto a separate drive and keeps that in a bank lockbox. Another option, he says, is to subscribe to a third-party backup service, if you don’t mind paying the fee. Alphabet (GOOGL) offers the Google Drive service, and other leaders in this area include Box (BOX) and Dropbox.On its website, the Federal Communications Commission shares tips for setting up your home wireless network to help ensure protection there. These include:When you’re back on the road with your computer, be sure to know the network you’re using.“So-called free Wi-Fi is hardly free if your personal information has been compromised, or your data has been intercepted,” Griffiths said. “It can be a pretty expensive proposition.”

471,IP,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is making a play for Intel’s (INTC) Chinese server market -- and maybe ""Super 7"" clients Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY) -- as the No. 1 chipmaker prepares for 12,000 layoffs, MKM analyst Ian Ing suggested Friday.Late Thursday, during AMD's Q1 earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su announced a $293 million joint venture with China's Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to ""help gain share in the fastest-growing region of the server market.""Su might as well have shouted a battle cry. This week, Intel announced a 12,000-layoff restructuring plan, cutting about 11% of its workforce, to ""intensify"" investments in the Internet of Things, memory and data centers. Intel's Q1 data center sales rose 9% year over year, vs. 7% for the company overall.AMD's Chinese joint venture is ""(the) best challenge yet to Intel's server dominance,"" MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. Last year, Chinese officials announced a plan to curb reliance on foreign chips.Partnering in China gives AMD ""access to design and IP resources that are tailored to the China market and significant local field sales and support resources to help win designs at a wide range of customers,"" Ing wrote.Intel's turn from PC reliance -- 55% of its total sales in Q1 -- could further boost AMD, which might scoop some PC market share, Ing wrote as he upgraded AMD stock to buy from neutral but maintained his price target of 4.For Q1, a 13-week quarter, AMD reported $832 million in sales, down 19% year over year, and a per-share loss ex items of 12 cents vs. a 13-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Both metrics topped the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $818.2 million and a 13-cent per-share loss.The consensus' Q2 sales guidance, calling for a 15% sequential hike, implies $956 million, which would be up 2%. The consensus saw $889 million, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kinngai Chan noted in a report.AMD stock jump 52% Friday, to 3.99, a 19-month high.

(Yellen - FED Chair - says rates are not going anywhere while members of the Peanut Gallery suggest that rates are going up at the end of the month) So once again the conflicting speeches did nothing but cause confusion and frustration among investors as the reality of exhausted monetary policy initiatives begins to bubble to the surface.And speaking of an 'exhausted monetary policy' – Did you hear all of the chatter around how the Yen continues to advance in the face of NEGATIVE interest rates? Yes – ma'am – the BoJ (Bank of Japan) last month introduced negative rates - as another source of stimulus - to try and force the Yen to weaken – thereby helping their export economy – but in a perverse twist of fate – the Yen has only strengthened vs. the dollar which is sending PM Shinzo Abe, Finance Minister Taro Aso and BoJ Governor Hauhiko Kuroda into a rage….And not to be outdone - negative interest rates imposed by the ECB (European Central Bank) two months ago are also NOT accomplishing the stated goals as the Euro continues to strengthen as well – sending Uncle Mario (Draghi) and other members of the ECB closer to the edge.But this leaves us to ask – are the strength in these currencies due to the recent FED inaction over the future of US interest rates or due to healthier Asian and European economies? The smart money is betting the former....(Remember: The expectation of a rate rise in March caused the dollar to rally vs. these currencies - from early Feb thru Mid March....but then - a NO action move by the fed, coupled with a clear concern over the state of the global economy caused the dollar to weaken sending these other reserve currencies higher and this is causing angst and panic among the paparazzi).Next up – we got a range of macroeconomic data points – all showing continued weakness in the economy which did nothing to help investor psyche – add in the chatter from some of the Fed representatives who discount the data and tell us that we are all wrong and that the economy is firing on all 12 cylinders and you have a perfect recipe for paralysis…..How's that working for you?And this week – there is plenty of global macro data points to digest. Retail sales from the US, China and Brazil. PPI's from the US, UK, Japan and China. CPI's from the US, UK, Euro zone, China. Industrial Production numbers from the US, Euro zone, China, Japan. Capacity Utilization and Empire Manufacturing from the US. We will also here from the BoE and the PBoC on additional monetary policy initiatives.Next up - Earnings! and while they tell us that we are NOT in another recession - there is no argument that US Corporate earnings are......As we know - this qtr is set to be the WORST season in 6 yrs.....with earnings projected to FALL by 9% - but with all of the most recent downgrades to earnings - the joke begins again.....You see - In the end – analysts cut the estimates to the bone, lowering the bar and making it almost impossible for companies NOT to beat the expectations and then the street gets to celebrate and the conversation turns to how the season 'wasn't so bad'…… (Psychology 101)Tonight after the bell - we get Alcoa (AA) - no longer considered the bell weather that it was when it was a member of the DOW - but their results will set the tone for some of the large multi-nationals.....The real kicker is going to be the major banks - think JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) which begin their confessional period on Wednesday...…..so watch for much more stock specific activity in the days ahead as the reports hit the tape. In the next couple f weeks - we will get the regional banks, energy and oil companies, retailers, drugs, healthcare, home builders, industrials/conglomerates and technology. What will the multinationals say about the state of affairs in their respective industries and the impact of monetary policy on their businesses – (Think dollar) vs. what will US businesses say about the condition of the US economy and the health of the US consumer?Remember – earnings are now history – they are what they are – what investors and the mkts want to see are the seeds of real top line revenue growth and projections for a more vibrant, robust future vs. continued talk of layoffs and cost cutting to support the bottom line…A quick glance back at mkt action over the past half dozen years and beyond reveals a seasonal weakness right after the 15th….and I would not expect this year to be any different at all…..I mean – What has changed in 8 yrs? Nothing really –Oh yes….the Obama administration will tell us how the economy has created some 14 mil new jobs and that the unemployment rate is below 5% and wages have stabilized and the consumer has never been stronger – and to that I say BS! Because if that were really true then FED policy would be different……rates would have normalized long ago, GDP would not be the pathetic sub 2% that it is, inflation would be greater than the 2% target and we would be seeing strong upward pressure on wages as companies compete for employees – and that is NOT happening at all. In fact – wages continue to weaken because of the massive supply of underemployed and unemployed Americans, older workers are getting thrown out in favor of younger less experienced workers (think expensive senior level people), other jobs continue to get shifted overseas where the minimum wage is maybe $3.50 an hr…Take the banking and credit card industry as an example – every time you call the 800 number – you get someone in a third world country that wants you SS number, your physical address, your IP address and your DOB... and then we wonder how we get our identities stolen?Overnight – Asian mkts were mixed. Japan (-0.5%) continues to be assaulted by a rising Yen sending exporters deeper into negative territory. BoJ Governor Kuroda is keeping a close eye on how a rising Yen is creating instability in the Nikkei and is prepared to act if need be. He will be in NY on Thursday - so expect to hear more from him then. In China (+1.4%) – The gov't released their March inflation data – CPI rose by 2.3% y/y – in line with forecasts while the monthly read fell by 0.4% m/m. The PPI fell by 4.3% y/y marking the 49th consecutive month of lower readings and this news only suggests that we can expect more monetary easing.

474,IP,"The World Bank also warned of slowing economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific Rim due to a weaker China.....(more of the same....but it is a reason for some of today's Asian weakness) .European mkts are all in positive territory now that oil reversed its course lower in early trading. The Euro is trading flat vs. the dollar and the expectation of additional monetary stimulus continues to support those mkts. so the focus for them is also the coming earnings season. FTSE +0.01%, CAC 40 + 0.59%, DAX + 1.19%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +1.42% and ITALY +1.74%US futures are higher by 9 pts this morning - in a continued game of 'cat and mouse' ....suggesting that the S&P will try to test the most recent highs of 2075 before the onslaught of earnings begins. Remember - the underlying tech tone of the mkts is suspect at best......Companies that are in buyback mode are effectively out of the mkt for now - so let's see how investors really feel about the quality of earnings and the quality of the global macro data. I continue to believe that we will remain in the 2040/2070 range until we get bank earnings beginning on Wednesday.....And then the real test begins.Take Good Care

The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose fractionally. Volume in the stock market today rose across the board.Blue chips were mostly up, but Caterpillar (CAT) took a 3.5% spill, slashing under its 50-day moving average line. Cat's quarterly results beat the Street's target on earnings but missed on revenue.Among the Transportation sector, which is No. 1 among 33 sectors, rail equipment maker Wabtec (WAB) gapped up more than 5% in brisk trade. The stock recrossed an 82.52 buy point first cleared in June. The company topped views on Q2 earnings, matched the consensus estimate on revenue and raised earnings guidance for 2014.The Internet sector's star of the day was Facebook (FB), which continued to hold most of its gap-up gain after smashing the Street's estimates late Wednesday. The stock was up nearly 6% after being up 7.6%. Volume was more than triple its usual pace. The Internet sector is No. 11 of 33 sectors.Paper and packaging stocks showed very strong action.

477,IP,"Several analysts on Friday boosted the target price for specialty chipmaker Ambarella, and the stock touched a new high after the company late Thursday gave Q3 guidance that exceeded Wall Street expectations.Ambarella (AMBA) CFO George Laplante said in a conference call with analysts Thursday that the company expects Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of 49 cents to 56 cents and revenue of $60 million to $64 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 37 cents and and $51.7 million.Deutsche Bank on Friday raised its price target on Ambarella stock to 35 from 27. Ascendiant Capital Markets raised its target to 42 from 37, while Topeka Capital Markets raised its target to 43 from 33.Ambarella stock was up nearly 4% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 37.Earlier, Ambarella stock, which has been on the IBD 50 for months, touched an all-time high of 39.16.Ambarella supplies chips for high-definition cameras used in such fields as sports, security and drone flights.Laplante told analysts that Q3 earnings projections partly hinge on expected strong sales in consumer products, ""including the automobile in certain regions, home security and quadcopters.""""I think sports cameras normally build for the holiday season,"" Laplante said. ""So I think it's across multiple markets. Our wearable sports camera and IP (Internet protocol) security markets, both professional and consumer, are expected to increase both sequentially and year over year. The automobile market revenues reflect increases in Korea and China, partially offset by softness in the Russian market.""Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang said that sales growth ""continues across all geographic regions,"" but added, ""the strongest growth was in China.""He also said, ""During the second quarter, many of our leading professional IP camera customers began volume commercial shipping of the 4K (new resolution standard for digital cinema and computer graphics) or ultra-HD cameras that were announced at ISC West 2014 Security Exposition in April.""""I think the 4K video has become more popular, and we believe over time all of our markets will move to 4K,"" Wang said.In the wearable sports camera market, Ambarella's Q2 sales were driven by market leader GoPro (GPRO), ""with its highly successful white, silver and black Hero 3-Plus"" camera models, Wang said.""We believe this (sports camera) market will continue to grow as consumers discover more applications for hands-free cameras beyond just action sports,"" Wang said. ""In the unmanned aerial vehicle or quadcopter market, manufacturers are increasingly offering integrated high-definition cameras as aerial video recording becomes a killer app for these products.""Ambarella expects to continue selling current products to another key customer, Dropcam, Wang said. Google's (GOOGL) Nest Labs said in June that it would acquire Dropcam for $555 million.""We are talking to the Nest management as well as the Dropcam management on the new product line and the new map, and hopefully we can develop a new product line in the future with them,"" Wang said.Dropcam and GoPro cameras remain on Amazon.com's (AMZN) list of its top five bestselling products, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a research note Tuesday. He said that roughly 25% of Ambarella's revenue comes from GoPro, which made its IPO in June at 24 and peaked above 57 on Wednesday.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarellareportedhttp://news.investors.com/technology/090414-716123-ambarella-q2-eps-jumps-beats-expectations.htm Q2 EPS ex items of 37 cents for the three months ending July 31, up 42%, on $47 million in revenue, up 24.6%, beating views.GoPro stock was up nearly 5% in midday trading Friday, near 55.50.

478,IP,"Computer networking midcap Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) said Monday it's agreed to acquire small-cap mobile networker Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) for $1.5 billion, sending Ruckus stock soaring 32%, as of midday, while Brocade stock plunged 14%.Under the deal terms, Ruckus stockholders will receive $6.45 in cash and 0.75 share of Brocade common stock for each share of Ruckus common stock, the companies said. Based on Friday's closing price, the transaction values Ruckus at $14.43 a share, or about $1.5 billion. The actual value is closer to $1.2 billion after netting out cash being acquired, the companies said.It's been a rough road for Ruckus, which went public priced at 15 in November 2012 and peaked four months later at 26.50. It hasn't traded higher than 13.50 in the last 18 months, most recently touching that interim high Oct. 15.In morning trading in the stock market today, Ruckus stock was above 13, while Brocade stock was near 9, 30% off a 13-year high of 12.88 touched last June.Network gear leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), a rival of both companies, was down 2% midday Monday, near 28.""The acquisition will complement Brocade's enterprise networking portfolio, adding Ruckus' higher-growth, wireless products to Brocade's market-leading networking solutions,"" Brocade said in its press release. ""It will also significantly strengthen Brocade's strategic presence in the broader service provider space, with Ruckus' market-leading Wi-Fi position.""Brocade expects the deal to accrete to non-GAAP earnings by its fiscal 2017's first quarter, ending Dec. 31, 2016. Ruckus CEO Selina Lo will continue to lead that company, reporting directly to Brocade CEO Lloyd Carney.""We operate in adjacent segments of the larger networking market, with a number of common customers for our complementary products, and have a successful track record of working together,"" Lo said in the merger announcement.Carney said the merger ""will position us to expand our addressable market and technology leadership with Ruckus' fast-growing wireless LAN products, and supports our vision to deliver market-leading new IP solutions that enable the network to become a platform for innovation.""Brocade's annual revenue hasn't grown by double-digit percentages since 2009, falling 1% in both 2013 and 2014, and growing only 2% last year to $2.26 billion. Earnings, however, grew 12% last year to $1.01 per share minus items.For its fiscal Q2 ending May 2, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Brocade to grow EPS ex items by 5% to 23 cents, on revenue up less than 1%, to $552 million.Analysts expect Ruckus to report Q1 earnings up 29% to 9 cents per share, with sales rising 20% to $98.4 million. For 2015, its EPS ex items fell 1 cent to 43 cents a share against a tough comparison in 2014, when earnings doubled to 44 cents. Revenue rose 14% to $373 million.Brocade carries a good 84 IBD Composite Rating, while Ruckus carries as modest 63. Cisco earns an 81 CR.Image provided by Shutterstock.

479,IP,"Deep in a turnaround that aims to reverse a long deceleration in revenue, BlackBerry (BBRY) is set to report earnings before the market open Friday.The smartphone maker that once dominated the field prior to the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android is pivoting to other areas. BlackBerry has made several acquisitions in the last two years, among them its $425 million purchase of software company Good Technology. The deal widely expanded BlackBerry’s security software platform to other smartphones and operating systems.BlackBerry will report fiscal fourth quarter earnings for the period that ended Feb. 29. The consensus estimate on revenue is $563.2 million -- down 15% year over year but an improvement over the 31% drop in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect BlackBerry to report a loss of 10 cents per share.“While the company may currently be showing possible signs of a recovery, we note that much of this strength can be attributed to IP licensing sales of $53 million last quarter,” wrote Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha. He has an underperform rating on BlackBerry and a price target of 6.BlackBerry stock closed at 8.09 Thursday, up 1%. Since hitting a low of 6.39 on Feb. 11, the stock is up 26%.“We believe the company is still faced with a challenging transition ahead,” Garcha wrote. “Despite strong software revenue last quarter of $162 million, we doubt the sustainability of the software business, as the IP licensing revenue seems unpredictable.”

480,IP,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) might score an Intel (INTC) license deal. It would scoop Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA), which receives $66 million in quarterly royalties from the No. 1 chipmaker, a Needham analyst says.But Argus analyst Jim Kelleher says that Nvidia has distanced itself from the PC market, instead focusing on niche growth areas like virtual reality (VR), autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and robotics.In VR, Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus recommends Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices graphics cards for its Rift series. This week, Oculus announced 30 new titles and demoed the tech at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Calif.Graphics cards are outfitted with GPUs, or graphics processing units. Advanced ones are needed for many of today's richly visual computing experiences that are computationally intensive -- everything from the movement in gameplay to VR and many other kinds of applications.On Friday, Kelleher initiated coverage on Nvidia stock with a buy rating and a 39 price target, a day after Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated a hold rating on Nvidia stock following the Intel-Advanced Micro Devices rumor. Nvidia is on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.In early trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock surged 3.9%, trading near 34.10 and in buy range from a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point. Advanced Micro Devices stock flew higher, up 4.3%, but usually trades considerably lower, near 3.Nvidia's royalty deal with Intel is set to expire in 2017, and the GPU leader failed in December to defend its patents in a lawsuit against Samsung and Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM).""We don't litigate for our business model,"" CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told investors in November. ""We don't depend on licensing for our business model.""To offset the loss of Intel's royalty stream -- which will impact 2017 earnings per share by 25-30 cents -- Nvidia needs to add $470 million in annual revenue, Gill wrote in a research report. He noted that Intel can continue using Nvidia patents filed before March 31, 2017.""While Nvidia has expressed interest in monetizing its GPU patent assets, we have seen little evidence to date that this will materialize,"" he wrote.Nvidia controls 75%-80% of the GPU market, having long ago ceded the gaming console market to Advanced Micro Devices, which provides its RADEON semi-customized chips to Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT).In 2013, PC sales accounted for 42% of total Nvidia revenue. In 2016, gaming, enterprise graphics, data center and automotive brought in 85% of total revenue, dropping PC sales down to 9%. IP brought in 6%.Gaming represents a $20 billion market opportunity for Nvidia, leading $8 billion, $6.5 billion and $5 billion opportunities in the artificial intelligence, enterprise graphics and data center markets, respectively, Kelleher wrote.In fiscal 2016, gaming (largely PC) generated $2.8 billion of Nvidia's total $5.01 billion in sales, up 30% year over year. Nvidia targets 5%-10% annual growth ""based on gamers' insatiable desire for improved graphics in games,"" he wrote.Nvidia also pulled in $750 million in enterprise graphics, $340 million in data center and $320 million in automotive. In fiscal 2016, Nvidia's automotive segment grew 80% year over year and includes Nvidia-Tesla-partnered GPUs.The U.S. Department of Energy selected Nvidia's NVLink interconnected technology coupled with IBM (IBM) processors to power its next-generation supercomputers, 10 times faster than current supercomputers.Kelleher recognized that 2018 earnings might flatten as Nvidia makes further investments in ""growth niches.""""We regard this as an acceptable trade-off for building share in markets that could drive significant growth in years to come,"" he wrote.

481,IP,"Is the person who viewed those leather boots on a laptop the same shopper who browsed the pricey footwear from a desktop but ended up buying the product using a tablet?That tricky question is behind the rise of cross-device tracking tools, and it's the reason why popular ""walled-garden"" sites like Facebook (FB) are gaining in the digital ad game.In the past, cookies were the universal bread crumbs of the Internet, helping advertisers find out which websites a particular user favored. Cookies are tiny text files that let websites recognize users -- usually by their IP (Internet protocol) address -- when they return to a website, thus learning their preferences. With this data, companies can serve targeted ads -- ads that they believe are most likely to lead to a sale.With the transition of Web users to mobile devices and apps, cookies aren't as effective, and advertisers are looking for new ways to identify users and learn their preferences.""When you understand who a user or person is, you can provide them with more relevant advertising or more personalized information if you are a publisher. That identity is potentially helpful to improve the experience,"" Greg Sterling, vice president of strategy and insights at the Local Search Association trade group, told IBD.Determining which exact ad prompted a shopper to buy, a process called attribution, ""is the holy grail of advertising right now. It's what everybody needs to understand,"" Anna Bager, senior vice president and general manager of mobile and video at the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, told IBD.Learning more about cross-device attribution is high on the must-do list for many ad pros this year, marketing firm Rocket Fuel said in a research report last month.A Rocket Fuel survey found that ad professionals also intend to learn more about data management platforms in 2016. DMPs help businesses get a panoramic view of their customers by collecting marketing information from a variety of channels, such as websites, emails and mobile ads.But first, advertisers want to be certain of just who those shoppers are.""The technology and the different methods to identify people across devices in the aggregate have become more sophisticated,"" said Sterling, who calls Facebook the leader in multichannel identification.""You have to sign in to use Facebook, so they will know if you're on a desktop computer, a laptop or a mobile device,"" Sterling said. ""They can provide whatever experience they want to provide because they know who you are, and there’s persistent identity there.""But Sterling says that the shift from using just one device to seeking content from a hodgepodge of desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones has created ""blind spots (where) people are not revealed to a Website publisher or a marketer. Somebody may sign in on one site and then go on to use the site on a mobile device and not sign in.""This trend is putting cross-device technology into the spotlight, as digital advertising, including mobile advertising, continues to boom. One trend is programmatic ad buying, where software determines ad buying and placement. It works best with ads targeted to user preferences, no matter the device used.Market research firm eMarketer estimates that programmatic digital display ad spending in the U.S., which reached $15.43 billion last year, will rise to $21.55 billion this year and $26.78 billion in 2017.Paris-based ad tech firm Criteo (CRTO) says its cross-device advertising tools work anywhere online, including on the mobile Web and inside apps.While cookies are a common standard used to identify and follow users in a browsing environment, that information can be “captured through other mechanisms when you are in applications,” Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland told IBD. “Our technology focuses on predicting the behavior of the user based on shopping intent information. That’s an area where we are developing pretty unique capabilities.""There are not many players in the industry able to develop cross-device capabilities. We are one of those few companies and we are investing significantly in this area of what we call ‘universal matching.’ ” Top social networks Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) are expected to emerge as big winners in 2016, as digital display-ad spending, which includes mobile ads, overtakes search-ad spending in the U.S. for the first time, according to separate reports this year from Cowen and eMarketer.  Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is seen as another winner, with its browser and slew of email, search and other services that have users logging in with their Google passwords.Facebook remains a dominant pick of the ad buyers surveyed, Cowen's report said, followed by Twitter, LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook-owned Instagram and privately held social sites Pinterest and Snapchat.EMarketer predicts that 2016 will be pivotal for Facebook; it's the first year in which more than half of the U.S. population is expected to use the social network. Facebook will capture 73% of social network ad spending in the U.S., or $9.9 billion, this year, eMarketer said last month. Twitter will be a distant No. 2, getting 14% of social network ad dollars, or $1.9 billion.The research firm also says that nearly 53% of U.S. mobile phone users will log onto Facebook at least once a month this year.Google is expected to remain No. 1 in 2016, with a 33.3% share of mobile ad revenue globally, eMarketer said in a report in March. It says that No. 2 Facebook's share will reach 17.7% this year.To learn user identities across devices, measurement companies rely on two methods -- ""deterministic"" and ""probabilistic.""Deterministic matching is at the core of the formidable cross-device matching success of Facebook, Google, Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Twitter and other so-called Walled Garden sites, eMarketer analyst Lauren Fisher said in an online seminar in January. Walled Gardens are websites and apps that require passwords for entry and have a treasure trove of information about users, making it easier to match consumers across multiple devices. So, in a nutshell, trackers can pretty much determine who a user is.In being able to identify users, Walled Gardens are ""not 100% percent, but press close,"" Fisher said in the seminar. ""Think about it -- even now retailers are making a practice of requesting email addresses when you check out in a store.""If I have Facebook on my tablet, on my phone, on my laptop at home and on my work computer, then Facebook knows all those devices belong to me because I'm logged in and they're using that login to tie everything together.""Fisher says eMarketer believes ""advertisers are going to continue to flock to the Walled Gardens throughout 2016.""While nearly foolproof, the shielded deterministic method used to match, measure and target customers can't be used on Web properties outside of the Walled Gardens.That's where probabilistic identity matching comes in.Companies using the probabilistic method analyze wider, non-proprietary digital tip-offs that people leave behind online when they have not used a sign-in. Such data could include which Web browser version a person uses, their physical location and their go-to content sites through use of cookies and such technology. With these methods, tracking is a more of a probable than a determined fact.""When companies start to collect that information and analyze it over time, they can begin to say with a certain amount of probability that a particular device belongs to a specific individual,"" Fisher explained.Some Web publishers rely on both the deterministic and probabilistic methods to cross-check and boost their device matching accuracy, Fisher said.""The bottom line,"" said Fisher, ""is there's no right or wrong approach.""

482,IP,"Mark Finn never saw a market sell-off he didn't like. As portfolio manager of the $21.2 billion T. Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), Finn often uses the dips to set up long-term positions in his mutual fund.The recent December-to-January stock market pullback presented its own set of opportunities for Finn. ""It has been a GDP-scare sell-off,"" he said ""People are worried the economy might tip back into a recession, so cyclicality is on sale right now. What I am looking for in particular are companies where I can get a really attractive dividend yield and (which) generate a lot of free cash flow and (which have) been cheapened because they're perceived to be cyclical business.""Finn is ready to pick his spots should more pullbacks occur in the months ahead. ""I am not overly optimistic about the market overall,"" he said. ""If we end the year flat to where we began, I think that would be as expected. In the interim, I'm getting chances to buy some really good companies with dividend yields of close to 5% that are trading at P/E multiples of 9 or 10 times.""T. Rowe Price Value was down 5.79% year to date going into Thursday vs. declines of 5.61% for its large-cap value peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 5.25% for the S&P 500. Over the past five years, the mutual fund has returned an annual average of 9.90%, beating its peers' 7.58% but trailing the S&P 500's 10.46%.The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A-, meaning it's among the top 10% of all mutual funds in three-year performance.Finn relies upon a robust team of research analysts to help with fundamental stock picking. “We are opportunistically trying to identify and invest in quality companies that are facing some controversy or perceived controversy that we have determined are trading below intrinsic value,” he said. “When we have a good idea, we make it a big position to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.”As of the end of 2015, General Electric (GE) was T. Rowe Price Value's top holding. Finn is optimistic that GE’s renewed focus on its industrial businesses will help increase margins over time. ""It has been one of the best-performing industrial companies over the last one, three and five years,"" he said. ""I think GE is going to continue to relatively outperform in industrials. They have really figured out what their mission is.""GE has seen its stock price climb 15.9% over the past year. The shares were up almost 1% in the stock market today.Pfizer (PFE), another top holding, has sunk 16% below its 52-week high. ""It has fallen back because of its Allergan (AGN) acquisition, but Pfizer is a phenomenal company with a really nice pipeline of products, and it now has a really good yield,"" Finn said.Pfizer is down 13% from a year ago, but sports a 4.0% dividend yield.In the energy sector, Finn has a favorable outlook for Exelon (EXC). ""It has a great dividend yield, and it looks like there may be a cyclical bottom coming in energy,"" he said.Shares of Exelon yield 4.0% and have gained 12% so far this year.Holdings that Finn sees as undervalued also include International Paper (IP) and AES (AES). “These are companies trading at around a 5% dividend yield, and the market perceives them as being cyclical and risky, but I really don't,” he said.

And Arista's No. 1 switching rival Cisco Systems (CSCO) closed down 0.8% to 27.38.On a trading day when indexes started out on an up note, declined and ended mixed, a fractional slip for Cisco after its 2.1% gain Wednesday can be taken in stride. However, both stocks saw rather wide trading ranges Thursday -- especially Arista -- coming off its 3% gain Wednesday.There ""could be confusion on SONiC,"" Needham analyst Alex Henderson told IBD.SONiC stands for ""software for open networking in the cloud,"" free software-defined networking (SDN) that makes Cisco's high-speed switches less needed. Microsoft (MSFT) announced this contribution to the Open Compute Project at the OCP U.S. Summit in San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday.""SONiC will enable cloud operators to take advantage of hardware innovation while giving them a framework to build upon an open source code for apps on the network switch and the ability to integrate with multiple platforms,"" posted Kamala Subramaniam, principal architect of Azure Networking, on a Microsoft blog Wednesday. ""SONiC is not just prototyped software but deployed today and planned to run at scale in the future.""Arista is part of Microsoft's team that created SONiC, along with Broadcom (AVGO), Dell and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX). Broadcom stock closed up 1.7% to 144.42. But Microsoft stock fell 1.5% to 52.05 Thursday and Mellanox slipped 0.6% to 48.42.As for Arista, SONiCally confusing or not, the company is ""superbly positioned"" to grow, Henderson wrote in a research note issued Thursday.""We like to think we are pretty technology savvy, but we always feel humbled when we go into Arista and delve into the technology landscape in detail,"" Henderson said. ""We hit a number of key issues including the 10G to 25G transition, the quality of the Broadcom Tomahawk, the opportunities in storage, the potential of the Jericho chip in the Edge router market, and the advantages Arista has in the SDN market.""This last point is particularly punctuated by the Microsoft contribution of . . . SONiC to the Open Compute Foundation. We come away convinced that ANET has multiple avenues of growth, and we expect continuing share gains.""He reiterated Needham's buy rating and 105 price target.Henderson noted that ""Cisco has been questioning the quality of the Tomahawk chip"" but Arista, which made the Tomahawk chip set available in its switches in September, ""argues the bugs in this first pass are minor and easily worked around in software"" and has ""good traction in the market already.""He said Arista ""seems to be seeing accelerating conversion of storage area networks (SAN) to storage over IP as ""major customers drive to a single unified architecture over IP.""He also observed a ""solid ramp,"" starting in the second half of this year, for Arista's 25G/50G/100G speed transition and learned that ""Arista thinks some portion of that (Edge router) market can be addressed with much lower-cost switches.""Arista's ""Linux-based, open, programmable and merchant silicon-based products are winning, and the trends continue to increase its advantage,"" Henderson said. ""We expect ANET to continue to outperform Cisco.""He probably means Arista should outperform Cisco's growth rate.In the fourth-quarter, Arista grew adjusted earnings per share by 51% to 80 cents, on revenue up 42% to $245 million. In Cisco's last quarter, ended in January, it grew adjusted EPS by 8% to 57 cents on flat revenue of $11.9 billion.In the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect adjusted earnings to grow 22% for Arista and 2% for Cisco.Image provided by Shutterstock.

514,IP,"Sluggish GoPro (GPRO) sales will force Ambarella (AMBA) to cut its fiscal 2017 guidance from earlier views for 15%-20% growth, a Needham analyst predicted Friday after the chipmaker late Thursday posted mixed Q4 results and disappointing Q1 guidance.Ambarella stock was down 9.5% in afternoon trading  on the stock market today, below 42. GoPro stock was down more than 2%. Ambarella makes key chips used in GoPro's Hero action cameras.Ambarella reported $67.97 million in sales and 64 cents earnings per share ex items, up 5% and down 6% year over year, respectively, for its fiscal Q4 ended Jan. 31.Sales topped the consensus model of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $65.8 million and Ambarella's own guidance for $65 million to $67.5 million, but EPS lagged expectations for 68 cents and declined for the first time in 18 quarters.Ambarella ended the year with $316.4 million in sales and $3.31 EPS ex items, up 45% and 66%, respectively. Both metrics beat the consensus for $313.6 million and $3.05.But Ambarella's outlook is ""messy"" at best, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson wrote in a research report. Erickson cut his price target on Ambarella stock to 62 from 72, but he kept his overweight rating.For Q1, Ambarella guided to $55 million to $57 million in sales, down 21% at the midpoint vs. the year-earlier quarter. It would be Ambarella's first year-over-year decline in 18 quarters.Ambarella cut its GoPro exposure to low single digits until it refreshes its wearable sports camera line, likely in October, Erickson wrote. Overall, wearable cameras should account for a mid-teen-percentage of sales in Q1, Ambarella CFO George Laplante said Thursday on the company's earnings conference call.The expected GoPro refresh, combined with strong seasonal IP security and drone sales, ""should drive a return to year-over-year growth,"" Erickson wrote.During Q4, China -- which generally contributes heavily to IP security camera sales -- was flat sequentially, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton wrote in a report. The IP security, drone and automotive segments all posted strong year-over-year growth, Bolton said.""But the consumer portions of these segments declined quarter over quarter,"" he wrote. ""As expected, wearable sports cameras declined substantially year over year and quarter over quarter.""Ambarella is shifting focus to the consumer and China professional IP security camera markets, where analysts say profit margins tend to be low.Quinn maintained his hold rating on Ambarella stock, noting cloudiness surrounding the China market.

515,IP,"Chinese hackers had already roamed Nortel's systems for nearly 10 years when, five years after the breach discovery, business communications firm Avaya acquired bankrupt Nortel Enterprise Solutions -- and, unknowingly, also acquired that company's attackers.That was a bellwether moment for the M&A world, says Caleb Barlow, IBM (IBM) vice president of security. Until then, an acquisition target's cybersecurity situation wasn't a box on the usual M&A checklist.""It was the moment everyone in the M&A community woke up,"" Barlow told IBD. ""They said, 'We better be looking at their security posture as well, otherwise you could not only legitimately acquire the company, but also the attacker.""As Barlow recounts, Nortel's downfall came down to seven passwords, including the chief executive officer's. Hackers with Chinese IP addresses gained access to Nortel's network as early as 2000 and so thoroughly dug in that they weren't discovered until 2004.Avaya, which acquired that Nortel business for $900 million in 2009, didn't learn of the breach until after its acquisition closed. And even then, the hackers were still entrenched in the system.""No one had really thought about this type of problem before because cybersecurity wasn't one of the normal things you'd think about in the M&A process,"" Barlow said. ""In my view, it's now a critical component.""Consulting firm Deloitte found 70% of 2,500 firms surveyed in 2015 considered security to be a ""high"" or ""very high"" priority in M&As. That's up from 64% in 2014. Both corporate and private equity respondents increased their due diligence efforts over the span of the year.But also in the 2014 Deloitte survey, 78% of firms said security wasn't a general piece of M&A due diligence, and 66% said rapid-fire M&A bidding made cyber risks ""very difficult"" to quickly quantify. Deloitte didn't reiterate those questions in its 2015 survey.Rapid-fire M&As include Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Microsemi (MSCC) last year facing off in a month-long bidding battle for PMC-Sierra (PMCS).Due diligence might or might not have been rushed in that deal, but such aggressive bidding wars are infrequent, Fortinet (FTNT) CFO Drew Del Matto told IBD. More often, an acquirer examines a target's products, financials, policies and systems. IT security is just a new layer of the necessary due diligence.This mindset is new, and there are built-in risks with every piece of due diligence, NSS Labs CEO Vikram Phatak says. NSS Labs independently tests and reports on the efficiency of cybersecurity products, similar to Consumer Reports.It's likely an acquirer has ""a really good handle on the debt the company will have, the expense structure of the company, the historical growth rates,"" he told IBD. ""Where you get a little sticky is they may not have time to do all the (security-related) due diligence by calling the customers.""Cybersecurity works along the same lines, Phatak says. Tech companies, especially, should have a keen understanding of the security measures in place, BitSight CTO Stephen Boyer told IBD. BitSight rates the cybersecurity posture of about 40,000 companies, similar to a FICO score, so customers can assess their own security risk but also the risks of potential or current partners, vendors and customers.""If you go in and say, 'Who's in charge of this (security)?' and everyone looks around, then you probably have a problem,"" Boyer said.Even including cybersecurity within due diligence isn't a surefire protection, Boyer said. Former telecom provider Pacnet discovered a breach on April 3, 2015, after Telstra finalized its $697 million acquisition of Pacnet.Telstra was notified on April 16 -- the day the merger completed. An SQL code injection on a Pacnet Web service application server opened hackers to the network, email and administrative processes.Acquirers should be ""monitoring that window of due diligence up until the week the deal closes,"" Boyer said. ""Monitor it all through the process, because there would be a slip-up along the way.""Before signing off on a merger, an acquirer should get a sense of the target's cybersecurity culture, Barlow says. Examine past incidents -- processes, logs and reports. If those documents aren't available, then there might be a problem.That goes double for a tech company.""If they don't have those policies in place, then you start asking other questions,"" Barlow said. ""If they weren't paying attention to security, what else weren't they looking at?""Phatak suggests acquirers also scope out a target's security vendors. Not every cybersecurity vendor is built the same and the quality of a target's security purchases can be very telling, he told IBD.""Make sure the company you're acquiring didn't skimp on security,"" he said. ""(Products) are not all equal, but from a compliance perspective, a check-box perspective, they all look the same.""Del Matto estimates two-thirds of breaches come from the inside, at the hands of either careless or disgruntled employees. M&A, often accompanied by layoffs, can breed the latter.""When people feel like they're at risk, they're more likely to do something that may expose the company to a cyber risk,"" Del Matto said. More benign actions, like inadvertently visiting an infected website, can lead to malware attaching on the system.But Del Matto is more concerned about the damage a disgruntled employee with absolute access can wreak. Barlow suggests a company identify its ""crown jewel"" and then tuck it into a protected place with limited access.That crown jewel could be IP, financial information, client lists, personal information -- basically anything worth stealing, Phatak told IBD.""If someone is able to get into the customer list, they could see what deals are in the (pipeline),"" Del Matto said. ""They may monetize those by selling them or, worse, leaving the company with those lists in their hands.""Beyond guarding that data, an M&A-engaged company should embrace employees into the new culture, he said. Because, ""when you buy a company, you buy a competitive advantage. If that leaks out in some other way, you're destroying the value of the M&A.""

516,IP,"Apple (AAPL) supplier and IBD 50 list growth stock Broadcom (AVGO) opened sharply up Friday, jumping into buy range. Thursday afternoon the company's quarterly report beat estimates despite slowing iPhone sales.In midmorning trading Friday Broadcom was up more than 6%, above 146 -- putting it now flirting with the top of buy range from a double-bottom base with a buy point of 138.79.Several high-rated chipmakers have been approaching buy zones lately with the market returned to an uptrend, including the two chipmakers on the IBD 50 list: Broadcom and Nvidia (NVDA), which makes chips for computation-intensive processes including graphics, gaming and self-driving cars.Ambarella (AMBA) stock was down more than 6% in the stock market today, after the maker of image-processing chips issued disappointing revenue guidance Thursday afternoon while topping views for its fourth quarter. Friday analysts lifted price targets for Broadcom and lowered them for Ambarella.Ambarella is a supplier to action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), which was trading up more than 8% Friday. It's down about 18% this year.""During the fourth quarter we saw strong sales from professional IP security, automotive aftermarket, home monitoring and flying camera markets,"" Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang said in the company's earnings release. ""This was largely offset, however, by a continued decline in the wearable sports camera market.""Ambarella is working to diversify its end markets and customer base.For its Q4 ended Jan. 31, Ambarella said revenue rose 5% from the year-earlier quarter to $68 million, and earnings per share fell 5.9% to 64 cents. That beat the view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who on average expected EPS of 48 cents on revenue of $66 million.But Ambarella gave lagging guidance for its fiscal Q1 2017. It sees revenue of $55 million to $57 million and net income of $8 million to $10 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have been expecting revenue of $62 million, and net income of just over $14 million.Ambarella gets an IBD Composite Rating of 74 and Broadcom a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in a variety of metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.RELATED: Can IBD 50's Broadcom Drive Chip Stocks?

517,IP,"Regulators' decision to investigate Tsinghua Holdings' now-defunct $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC) could signal ""a heightened sense of scrutiny on all Chinese investments in U.S. technology,"" a Macquarie analyst wrote Tuesday.That's sure to frustrate Micron Technologies (MU) which, analysts say, could be examining a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Last year, Micron reportedly rebuffed a $23 billion bid from Tsinghua Holdings' chip-arm, Tsinghua Unigroup.MKM analyst Ian Ing says Micron could seek to become a ""local supplier"" for the Chinese memory market by entering a JV. A JV stands a better chance of getting approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.But the CFIUS is increasingly wary of Chinese investments in U.S. technology, Macquarie analyst Deepon Nag wrote in a research report. Tsinghua Unigroup plans to invest $47 billion to oust Apple (AAPL)-supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) from its No. 3 chipmaking slot.""We see increased risk that Chinese investment in U.S. semiconductor assets won't be allowed to take place, which we believe is an incremental negative for Micron,"" Nag wrote.Early Tuesday, Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary Unisplendour pulled its $3.8 billion funding in Western Digital after CFIUS regulators decided to investigate the investment. Nag sees little chance of IP theft in such a ""passive investment,"" but other analysts have suggested that Unisplendour was making a play for SanDisk's (SNDK) coveted Nand technology.Western Digital announced its plan to acquire SanDisk a month before Unisplendour was to invest the $3.8 billion for a 15% stake in Western Digital.""Tsinghua put $3.8 billion in Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD in December. On Wednesday, Sundararajan said the Western Digital-SanDisk deal would proceed without Unisplendour.It's a marriage of ""necessity and convenience,"" he wrote in a report. Western Digital investor Alken Asset Management opposes the transaction, claiming the price is too high and SanDisk faces an uphill Nand battle, but the objection ""comes a bit late.""Toshiba and SanDisk have made rapid progress in 3D Nand, Sundararajan says. And SanDisk has ""gobs of Nand IP"" plus licensing sales to justify the price. Western Digital cut the price Tuesday after Unisplendour's exit to about $78.50 per share. Shareholders are set to vote on the transaction March 15. If it fails, Western Digital will have to pay a $184 million fee.""We find that net-net most of the objections expressed by Alken, while legitimate, ignore the strategic importance to Western Digital of having a captive Nand source as well as in-house Nand IP and a well-trained group of Nand experts,"" Sundararajan wrote.But Nag says the Unisplendour exit gives Western Digital the opportunity to reduce or completely drop the SanDisk deal. Out of 280 tech M&A deals in the past 30 years, nearly 10% were ultimately revised downward, he wrote.And considering Western Digital's slough in stock price -- down 43.5% since the deal was announced -- the acquisition will likely be dilutive, Nag wrote. On Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani estimated that the transaction would be 34% dilutive without the Unisplendour investment.""As a result, we believe that Western Digital will be highly motivated to renegotiate the price of SanDisk lower,"" Nag wrote.On the stock market today, SanDisk stock rebounded 4.9% to close at 69.90, after closing down 1.6% on Tuesday. Western Digital stock rose 2.7% vs. a 7.2% decline Tuesday.

518,IP,"The 2014 debut of Apple's Apple Watch and the release of the Google Glass computing eyewear the prior year stamped both tech giants as leading innovators of wearables.Except that neither Apple (AAPL) nor Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is actually the leading innovator in wearables. Microsoft (MSFT) is.At least, Microsoft is No. 1 worldwide when looking at patents for wearable-related technology, according to LexInnova, a patents-consulting firm.Microsoft has 757 wearables patent filings, Rana Pratap, LexInnova's principal consultant for technology, told IBD. At least 53 filings are directly related to wrist devices. Another 13 are related to eyewear.Netherlands-based Philips (PHG) is right behind in wearables-related intellectual property, with 756 wearables patents and patent applications. Alphabet, parent of Google, has 602 to place at No. 3, and the patent numbers drop off precipitously from there, says LexInnova, which recently researched the topic.Apple, for instance, has only 197 filings, says LexInnova. Wearables startup Fitbit (FIT) has 192 filings.That is a good bit of patent activity, but then again, this market is already generating a good bit of revenue.""We estimate the wearables market at $8.9 billion in wholesale device revenue in 2015,"" Cliff Raskind, an analyst for market research firm Strategy Analytics, told IBD.While some of Microsoft's wearables portfolio is getting old -- U.S. patents last no more than 20 years -- Pratap says that, collectively, the patents remain strong. So, Microsoft's wearables patent portfolio doesn't just have quantity, but also quality.LexInnova uses a proprietary algorithm involving about 50 factors, including patent age, the number of times a patent has been cited in other companies' patent filings, and court rejection of challenges to a patent, to judge the quality of patent portfolios, Pratap explains. Without giving details, he said Microsoft's is strong.But the ramifications of Microsoft’s wearables-patent activity are unclear. Satya Nadella, who was promoted to Microsoft CEO two years ago, is focused on companywide strategies designed to recharge Microsoft’s growth.Microsoft, like any company, could develop products based on its patents, license its patents or both. The company last month disclosed that it has signed 1,200 licensing agreements of all kinds since launching its IP licensing program in December 2003. One of the most recent agreements involved licensing wearables-related technology to Olio Devices, a niche watchmaker.""Maybe Microsoft has been watching what Google's doing (with technology licenses) and longingly remembering their big (operating system) licensing days,"" said Raskind. ""That could be where they are going with the Olio deal.""Pratap says 700 of Microsoft's wearables patents are based on Microsoft’s own research.""According to our analysis, 49 patents and applications (were) acquired from Tangis,"" he said. Microsoft acquired another seven from Osterhout Group and one was acquired from Antenova.So what, if anything, is Microsoft planning in wearables?""I'm not necessarily watching for a Microsoft wearables pop-up retail store next Christmas,"" said Amy Webb, founder of technology forecasting and strategy consulting firm Webbmedia Group.Webb and others say there are more lucrative, near-term markets for wearables for Microsoft to exploit with its portfolio. More on that in a moment...Microsoft's intellectual-property cache might surprise some. The company sells only one internally developed wearable product, the Band 2 fitness tracker bracelet, and executives say they will begin selling eyewear called HoloLens by April.Plus, executives rarely discuss Microsoft's large overall patent portfolio. Indeed, Microsoft declined to comment for this story.""Whenever we do a patent analysis like this, we find that the biggest (technology) companies in a sector have the most patent filings,"" Pratap said, thanks to their often large research-and-development units.R&D spending by Microsoft has been gradually rising since 2010, reaching $12 billion in 2015, according to market-statistics firm Statista.Pratap points out that Microsoft's wearables portfolio began before it had a wearables product line. The earliest relevant patents resulted from other research projects. Over time, these innovations were recognized as addressing the new wearables market.This is common for tech and manufacturing companies, he says.Like all successful technology innovators, Microsoft has much experience -- good and bad -- with developing products and licensing technology.The company's first hits were the MS-DOS and Window operating systems, both of which were licensed so extensively that Microsoft endured years of antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe.There have been notable failures, too. Microsoft intellectual property was used to develop the firm's Zune digital music hardware. Microsoft also licensed Zune technology. Neither approach could save the entertainment player, which was discontinued last fall.Webb says developing products and licensing technology each have advantages and disadvantages.Licensing intellectual property typically brings modest, low-risk and ongoing revenue. A disadvantage of licensing is that it can put the licensee in the background when the technology succeeds in someone else's product.Development costs more compared with licensing and puts any failure in a company's lap. But the potential revenue upside is far larger, and the company is tied visibly to market success.While Webb says she has not had any contact with Microsoft regarding wearables, she feels the company is not likely to focus its related intellectual property solely or even primarily on consumer goods like fitness trackers.She said the most immediate market is for business-to-business applications (as was the case for MS-DOS), and what she calls ""B-to-D"" -- business-to-doctor. Health-monitoring and diagnostic roles for wearables are growing today, and they should continue to expand as medical wearables become small, inexpensive and sophisticated, Webb said.But rival Apple is making an aggressive bid to invade health care with mobile devices and HealthKit, the company's software platform for health-related applications.According to Black Book Market Research, almost 70% of physicians using medical apps do so on iPhones. That is a size-14 foot in the door for Apple.Webb says the promise of significant new revenue and the need to keep Apple at bay are likely to persuade Nadella to sift Microsoft's patent portfolio for related innovations.

519,IP,"Verizon Communications (VZ), in a move that could boost its plans to offer 5G wireless services, agreed to buy privately held XO Communications’ fiber-optic network for about $1.8 billion.Verizon said it expects the deal to close by June 30.Level 3 Communications (LVLT) has also been viewed as a potential buyer of XO Communications.Controlled by activist investor Carl Icahn, XO Communications provides services to large and midsize businesses. It also connects cellphone towers to mobile switching centers, where calls are routed to long-distance networks. In that market, XO competed with Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) and others.Verizon plans on improving its wireless network with “small cell” technology in urban areas, a process called densification. The low-power “base stations” are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces.“Verizon’s ownership of XO’s fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks will help better serve enterprise and wholesale customers. In addition, acquired fiber facilities will help Verizon continue to densify its cell network,” said Verizon in a statement.Verizon will also lease XO Communications' high-frequency wireless spectrum, with an option to buy for $200 million, by year-end 2018, UBS said in a research report.""LMDS (local multipoint distribution service) is very high frequency spectrum in the 28-31 GHz bands, which Verizon believes will be well-suited for 5G,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in the report. ""XO’s LMDS spectrum covers some of the largest U.S. metros, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami, Tampa, Dallas and Austin, Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.""XO has also competed in what’s called the “special access” market, along with Sprint (S) and Level 3, vs. Verizon and AT&T (T). The Federal Communications Commission has been probing how banks, schools, retail outlets and others buy high-speed data services from telecom companies.Verizon stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today.

520,IP,"Micron Technologies (MU) rebuffed Tsinghua Unigroup's $23 billion bid, but that doesn't mean the memory chipmaker has scrapped plans for Chinese partnership, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote Tuesday in a research report.That partnership could come in the form of a joint venture, Ing wrote in a research report after Micron's analyst day on Friday. Ing reiterated a buy rating and 19 price target on Micron stock, which was up 7.3% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 10.80.""We think Micron would require control of both IP and production decisions in the structure of any JV,"" he wrote. ""The biggest benefit to Micron is the ability to produce output as a 'local supplier' and national champion for China's domestic market.""China plans to invest $55 billion in local chipmaking businesses by 2020 in an effort to curb reliance on foreign semiconductors. But state-sponsored Tsinghua Unigroup's bid for Micron was doomed from the start, analysts say, as U.S. regulators would have shut it down.A joint venture, however, wouldn't necessarily spike regulators' concerns. Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said he ""would not be surprised by an equity investment in Micron from one of the Chinese private equity companies.""After its failed Micron bid last year, Tsinghua Unigroup invested $3.8 billion in Western Digital (WDC), days before Western Digital announced its plan to acquire flash memory chip maker SanDisk (SNDK).""(Micron) has a presence in all major memory markets, which makes it particularly interesting from M&A or an equity investment target for China Inc.,"" Pitzer wrote in a report. ""While (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) could be an issue for outright sale, the company could still attract equity investment in China.""Pitzer reiterated his outperform rating and 20 price target on Micron stock. Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan rates Micron stock a buy, with a 21 price target.""The backdrop of any buy thesis on Micron over the medium term should be that Samsung is not doing well,"" Sundararajan wrote in a research report.Apple (AAPL) and Chinese LCD manufacturers are scooping share, and Samsung has yet to squeeze much profit out of its nascent 3D Nand flash chips, he wrote. DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) profitability could be Samsung's ""salvation,"" but its capital expenditures cut has yet to bear fruit. DRAMs are the most common memory chips in computers.Meanwhile, Micron is slimming costs, Sundararajan wrote. In 20-nanometer DRAM, Micron is targeting a cost reduction CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 15%-25% through fiscal 2017, Pitzer wrote. Micron also sees 25% cost reduction CAGR in 3D Nand.""Any progress in closing the cost 'gap' will drive stock performance,"" Pitzer wrote. A rebound could pull Micron stock out of its trough, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report as he upgraded Micron stock to buy from neutral.Sundararajan also expects Micron to let Intel (INTC) work out the kinks in the jointly-owned 3D X-Point chip and then ""exploit it advantageously"" from 2018.""Good times will come should Micron execute,"" he wrote. ""Micron has dashed hopes and portfolios in 2015, hence it is important to ignore those getting out of Micron stock and take a fresh look.""Even with Tuesday's gain, Micron stock is roughly 70% off a nearly 16-year high touched in January 2015.

521,IP,"Rovi (ROVI) stock jumped as much as 19% Friday to an 11-month high, following the company's fourth-quarter earnings late Thursday that beat estimates, as revenue growth reversed four straight quarters of deceleration.The focus now shifts to first-quarter performance and Rovi’s ability to renew licensing agreements with Comcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH).Rovi provides technology for interactive TV program guides licensed by AT&T (T), Comcast, Time Warner Cable (TWC), Dish and others, used for interactive TV guides and video-on-demand services. It also provides advertising services, including Big Data analytics that provides TV-audience insights and ad campaign management in various entertainment sectors.It posted Q4 revenue of $149.5 million, up 11% year over year and topping the consensus estimate of $130.7 million. It was the first time in five quarters that Rovi revenue accelerated. It reported earnings per share minus items of 65 cents, smashing estimates of 37 cents. That reversed four straight quarters of slower EPS growth.Rovi stock was up 14%, near 20.50, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.During Q4, Rovi renewed a technology licensing agreement with AT&T, which now includes the DirecTV footprint, for a seven-year term, in addition to a renewed licensing agreement with Sony (SNE).“In 2016, Rovi is focused on successfully renewing our IP Licenses with Comcast and Dish and on building our product portfolio,” Rovi CEO Tom Carson said in the earnings release. “We believe achieving these goals will help drive stockholder value for years to come.”While Rovi said it expects to successfully renew agreements with Comcast and Dish, its revenue and EPS from those agreements are not included in current estimates. Excluding revenue from Comcast and Dish, Rovi anticipates 2016 revenue of $490 million to $520 million and EPS less items of $1.35 to $1.65.Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said the renewals with Comcast and Dish remain likely but are far from certain.""Rovi is in the latter stages of negotiations with Comcast and Dish, as the current deals expire over the next two months,” Hargreaves wrote in a research note. “Rovi’s history suggests it is more likely than not to complete the deals successfully, but a delayed negotiation or even a lawsuit remains highly possible, either of which could drive significant stock volatility.”

523,IP,"With its soaring growth, Facebook (FB) may soon take steps to ease its tax burden, according to a Morgan Stanley report.And, Morgan Stanley says, Facebook is one of a list of technology and pharmaceutical companies that could gain if Congress creates a “patent box” as part of corporate tax reform.Other companies that would benefit from a patent box, also called an ""innovation box,"" would be Qualcomm (QCOM), chip maker Xilinx (XLNX), as well as drug companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), says the report.A patent box provides lower tax rates on royalty income generated from licensing. Intellectual property can include patents, trademarks, designs and logos.On Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley noted: “The IP licensing business is conducted almost entirely in the United States, and as such, we believe it generally pays near full corporate taxes.”Shares in Facebook jumped 16% by early afternoon in the stock market today, after the social networking giant late Wednesday said Q4 revenue jumped 52% from a year earlier to $5.84 billion.“In 2015, we estimate that around 51% of Facebook’s revenue will be generated internationally. Despite this fact, we estimate that Facebook will have (an approximate) 34% adjusted tax rate in 2015 (very close to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%). Going forward, Facebook may take steps to reduce its tax burden,” the Morgan Stanley report said.Congress could pass legislation overhauling corporate taxes, it said.Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have proposed tax reform aimed at “tax inversion” deals, in which companies relocate headquarters to a lower-tax nation, usually following an acquisition.“A patent or innovation box might be the United States' best means to combat inversions and remain competitive with other countries,” said the Morgan Stanley report.Supporters say a patent box would also help keep research and development in the U.S.

"
588,IP,"Boise's packaging products include linerboard, corrugated containers and sheets, and protective packaging. Its paper products include imaging papers, printing and converting papers, and papers used in packaging.
"
589,IP,"On a September conference call announcing the deal, PCA Executive Chairman Paul Stecko called the buy a ""transformational opportunity with excellent fit and unique and substantial synergies.""
"
590,IP,"The synergies, he said, would come primarily from: ""containerboard grade optimization and sales mix, manufacturing cost reduction, lower transportation cost, corrugated products optimization, and SG&A (selling, general and administrative) cost reductions.""
"
591,IP,"At the time, PCA expected synergies from the deal of $105 million over the next three years, to be achieved at about $35 million per year. But on its Feb. 11 fourth-quarter conference call, PCA upped the synergy estimate to $175 million, at a run rate of $75 million to $80 million by the end of the first year.
"
592,IP,"Actions taken immediately after the October 25 acquisition and completed by the end of the year included the elimination of about $25 million in overhead cost, primarily from reduced head count and lower corporate governance cost, the company said.

"
596,IP,"Savings From Synergies
"
597,IP,"Morningstar analyst Todd Wenning says initially he had some concerns about PCA management having enough experience managing a paper business, because its focus has been on containerboard and the fact that North American office paper demand is in secular decline.
"
598,IP,"""We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of cost synergies,"" he said. ""Once they got into the white paper mills they found they could apply some of the knowledge from their containerboard mills to Boise's paper mills.

603,IP,"PCA's corrugated products shipments were up 4.4% from a year earlier and increased 24% including Boise's partial quarter shipments. Containerboard production, including Boise, was 803,000 tons, up 151,000 tons from a year earlier.

609,IP,"At the time the deal was announced, management said when combined with Boise, PCA's containerboard capacity would increase to 3.7 million tons from its then-current level of 2.6 million tons, or by 42%.

"
613,IP,"Ng cites the fact that with the consolidation in the industry, a lot of customers are looking to diversify their supply base.

622,IP,"Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) could reach a cross-licensing agreement for designs on their heart valves, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar suggested Thursday after Boston triumphed in a German court on patent issues.The court ruled Edwards infringed on two of Boston's patents for a ""skirt"" and a ""sac"" to reduce leaks for transcatheter aortic valve replacements. But the court also ruled Boston infringed on one of Edwards patents for a structure within the heart valve known as the ""support beam."" It tossed out a second Edwards patent.The German decision puts Boston in ""a commanding position in its IP litigation with Edwards,"" Kumar wrote in a research report. He expects Boston to file for a court action that would prevent Edwards from selling its heart valve in Germany. An injunction is unlikely while Edwards' appeal is ongoing, he wrote.Thursday's ruling follows a U.K. decision last week in which a court ruled one Edwards' patents for a ""sac outside the anchor to provide a seal"" as valid and infringed. But a second patent for a fabric seal on its Sapien 3 valve was ruled invalid.Edwards said Thursday it's planning to appeal the German decision. The company expects court proceedings to continue in various locations over an extended period of time. The two med-tech giants also are battling it out in the U.S., France and Canada.Boston Scientific stock closed up 0.7% at 24.69 on the stock market today, and Edwards jumped 3.9% 93.06.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic are battling it out in the heart-valve market. Who leads? Head to Sector Leaders for a deep dive.Edwards is also appealing portions of the UK court decision, but precedence doesn't look good for the company, Kumar wrote. In an earlier patent battle with Medtronic (MDT) regarding heart-valve tech, higher courts upheld decisions in Germany and the UK. Medtronic and Edwards ultimately settled. Medtronic pays Edwards a royalty of no less than $40 million annually.Edwards has 65% of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement — a type of heart-valve replacement — market, Kumar wrote. Medtronic trails with 30%. Using the earlier settlement model, Edwards could end up paying Boston no less than $80 million per year, he said. Or, the duo could agree to license one another's tech.""In our scenario analysis, we had noted that in the event Boston Scientific wins and Edwards Lifesciences comes out with the poorer hand, it could potentially force the players to arrive at a cross licensing agreement,"" he wrote.RELATED:Edwards Stock Dips On Patent Loss In Lawsuit With Rival BostonMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Medtronic, Edwards

624,IP,"AbbVie (ABBV) is a stronger stock bet than Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Amgen (AMGN), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Thursday after comparing the biopharmas' Q4 earnings, 2017 trajectory and typical R&D turnover.""This analysis suggests that AbbVie offers more attractive fundamentals based on earnings momentum and dividend yield, and is the only company of the three that is likely to show sustained improvements in operating margin and cash flow over the next four years,"" Porges wrote in a research report.Like Gilead, AbbVie's earnings growth is largely based on operating revenue increases. But, Porges notes, those increases are due to volume growth for Humira, Imbruvica and Viekira. Gilead has boosted its operating revenue by increasing prices on franchise hepatitis C drug sales, he said.Both companies derive the lion's share of their sales from a single segment. In 2014 and 2015, Gilead saw sales spike on its hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. Because HCV is a curable disease, sales plunged in 2016. Humira, AbbVie's anti-inflammatory, has been stronger. In Q4, its sales rose 15.5%.The two are also pitted in a patent battle over AbbVie's claims that an Amgen biosimilar drug infringes on its Humira patents. Though AbbVie is shoring up to defend its IP on Humira, analysts expect biosimilars to come online over the next few years.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, analysts broadly see Incyte as a strong stock option with a number of potential blockbuster drugs in its pipeline. Read on in The New America for better insight into the firm.""AbbVie is certainly facing growth and quality issues beyond 2020, when the outlook for Humira becomes increasingly uncertain, but all three companies face generic, biosimilar and branded threats that challenge their current blockbuster product franchises,"" Porges wrote.Still, earnings momentum looks good for AbbVie in 2017 and 2018. In January, AbbVie guided to $5.44-$5.54 earnings per share ex items in 2017, which would be up 14% at the midpoint. That outlook didn't chip at consensus views for 2018, which are at $6.44.Gilead's forecasts have declined significantly over the past 14 months, Porges wrote. ""It's possible these estimates could decline more given the recent trend,"" he noted.

627,IP,"The misappropriation of American intellectual property (IP) — patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets — costs American businesses hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and diminishes incentives to innovate that are key to American economic growth and prosperity.While much attention has been paid to direct theft of IP, actions of foreign governments, particularly (but not exclusively) in Asia, to diminish the value of IP through the misapplication of antitrust law is far less reported — but it is a serious and growing threat to America's economic future. The Trump administration should act decisively to deter such harmful foreign government activity and thus promote American competitiveness.The experiences of two great American innovative companies and major patent holders, Qualcomm and InterDigital, illustrate the seriousness of the problem.Qualcomm introduced (among other innovations) CDMA technology to global mobile communications two decades ago, which made access to the internet and the flow of enormous amounts of data possible. Qualcomm is the leader in fourth generation mobile computing and is hard at work on developing fifth generation technological leadership. InterDigital designs and develops advanced technologies that enable and enhance mobile communications and capabilities.In recent years, both those companies have faced major antitrust charges in China and South Korea, essentially based on the claim that they charged ""too much"" for patent licenses.The problems faced in Asia by Qualcomm, InterDigital, and other American technology leaders were discussed in detail in a Dec. 6 Heritage Foundation panel discussion focusing on foreign government antitrust abuses that undermine U.S. IP rights.Federal Trade Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen opened by offering recommendations for spurring reform. She explained that American companies too often are not given the opportunity to defend themselves adequately against or to appeal foreign Asian governments' antitrust charges.  She urged that Asian enforcers confront this problem by adopting stronger due process and transparency protections, building their cases on hard facts showing harm to competition, not unsupported theories — ""evidence-based antitrust."" Ohlhausen argued that such steps would enhance the quality and credibility of foreign agencies' decision-making.Former Patent and Trademark Office Chief David Kappos lamented that a key Chinese agency acts as ""judge, jury, and executioner"" in antitrust proceedings, neglecting the most fundamental concepts of fairness. He stressed that American antitrust enforcers need to end their own bad policies and actions that undermine strong IP and give rhetorical fuel to foreign regimes.He proposed that the U.S. Trade Representative focus on better enforcement of bilateral treaty provisions that guarantee due process in antitrust proceedings, and aggressively undertake research and reporting on foreign enforcement abuses. He added that an increased U.S. government presence at foreign enforcement proceedings could prove helpful.The last two speakers, Stewart Chemtob and Tad Lipsky, leading antitrust lawyers who have also served in the Justice Department, described in detail the arbitrary treatment that American firms have received at the hands of Asian antitrust enforcers. They recommended that solving due process problems be prioritized in bilateral consultations between the United States and foreign countries.The further proliferation of industrial policy attacks on America's most innovative firms, masquerading as antitrust, is a clear and present danger to American innovation. The recent Heritage panel provided no ""silver bullet"" solution.  Swift and decisive actions by the new Trump administration are called for, in order to curb a severe threat to American innovation and economic vitality. Here are some suggestions:These steps are not a panacea, but if the Trump Administration takes them boldly and decisively, they may begin to turn the tide against foreign governmental threats to U.S. innovation.

But the comment didn't cloud the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Calif. Read on for updates from the conference.RBC analyst Michael Yee calls the situation a ""great scenario for both players."" Forward adds $1.25 billion in cash and a possible 10% royalty to its $845 million market cap. Biogen removes a stock overhang and provides visibility.""A patent cliff on Tecfidera could have had big issues for investors and led to multiple compression and growth concerns post 2020,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""While a headline large number, the $1 billion plus in cash is not a big deal in big picture for Biogen.""In most scenarios, Biogen's patents on Tecfidera should now extend to 2026-28, Yee wrote. Interference discussions are ongoing in the U.S. If Biogen loses interference, it will pay Forward a 10% royalty on Tecfidera sales 2021-28. That decision is expected March 22.Evercore analyst John Scotti calls the settlement an ""insurance policy"" for Biogen.""Regardless of whether or not Biogen wins or loses the IP disputes, Tecfidera will likely now be branded beyond 2023,"" he wrote. ""If Biogen were to lose the interference without this insurance policy, it would have been possible that Biogen would have had to pay both back payments on Tecfidera as well as royalties.""RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OK

686,IP,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) will likely triumph in a patent battle with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), requiring the duo to pull LDL-buster Praluent from the shelves — an unprecedented first, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi have asked a federal circuit judge to grant a stay of the injunction beyond 45 days. That would allow them to market Praluent during the appeal, which typically runs up 16 months, Porges wrote in a research report Friday.But the odds don't look good. Specialists believe ""regardless of the ultimate merits of Regeneron and Sanofi's case, they will face an unprecedented (and probably first) branded pharmaceutical product withdrawal in the middle of this quarter,"" he wrote.The most important catalyst will be whether the Federal Circuit extends the stay, Porges says. Of 158 permanent injunctions (PIs) granted in federal or district court since a 2006 case involving Ebay, only 37 parties (23%) were granted a stay.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company have a different-enough LDL drug that shouldn't touch Amgen's patents, analysts say. The Medicines Co. presented data at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Check out five key take-aways from the meeting.In Regeneron and Sanofi's case, though, it would be the first time a branded drug would be pulled from shelves as a result of patent litigation. They have made the argument that public interest would not be served by pulling Praluent, which offers a lower dosage than Amgen's Repatha.Examining medical-device cases, the district court has stayed a PI in five cases. But at the federal level, the PI was affirmed and not extended, resulting in the removal of those products from the market. Those precedents appear to be ""stacked"" against Regeneron and Sanofi, Porges said.To Regeneron and Sanofi's public interest argument, Porges noted that public interest is actually better served in siding with the patent holder, thus encouraging the risky investment required in bringing an innovative product to market.Porges also looks at several outcomes. It's possible that the case could be remanded to the district court. The federal circuit could also require Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi to seek settlement assistance via the Circuit Mediation Office. But that process only happens in 10%-20% of cases.Amgen, the No. 1 biotech firm by market cap, is unlikely to settle, he wrote. The company ""notoriously takes the stance to never settle IP disputes and vigorously defends the company's IP, as evidenced by the blockage of market entry for Roche's Epogen competitor Mircera until the infringed patent expired.""In the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 0.49% to 156.12, but Regeneron rose 1% to 368.16 and Sanofi rose 2.1% to 41.47.RELATED:Could Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?Regeneron, Sanofi Hammers After Judge Bans Amgen-Rivaling LDL-Buster

687,IP,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

689,IP,"When a company fails at its basic mission in a way that harms the public, and then tries to mislead the public about it, newspaper reporters can be counted on to immediately swoop in and demand that the company be held to account.So what happens when the company in question is a major, highly influential newspaper? Let's see.On Friday, the Washington Post published an earth-shattering report that Russian hackers had infiltrated the U.S. electricity grid through a Vermont utility.The story's lede said that a ""code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials.""It went on to say that while ""the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a security matter, the penetration of the nation's electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability.""""Officials said that it is unclear when the code entered the Vermont utility's computers,"" the story added.This was huge news, and for good reason. If Russian hackers, or any hackers for that matter, had found their way into the U.S. electricity grid, there would be almost no end to the harm they could cause. Not surprisingly, the Post story spread like wildfire.But it turns out that none of it was true. Zip. Zero. Nada.There was no code, the grid was never at risk, and the ""threat,"" such as it was, had nothing to do with Russia.In fact, hours after the story posted, it was updated to note that the utility in question said there was only one computer involved — not ""computers"" — which wasn't in any way connected to the power grid. Strike one.Three days later, the story fell apart completely. What actually happened: ""An employee at Burlington Electric Department was checking his Yahoo email account Friday and triggered an alert indicating that his computer had connected to a suspicious IP address,"" the Post reported on Monday.Strike two and three. In short, there was no story at all worth reporting.Worse, the Post tried to bamboozle the public about what happened. The Post's top PR official, Kris Coratti, told Forbes contributor Kalev Leetaru that the reporters involved had reached out to both Vermont utilities before the story first posted Friday night. But Leetaru checked the original version of the story, captured by the Internet Archive, and found no evidence to back this up. An official at the utility in question told Leetaru that he didn't hear from the Post until after the story published. Had the Post talked to the utility before rushing onto the web, the story probably never would have seen the light of day.""It is simply astounding that any newspaper, let alone one of the Post's reputation and stature, would run a story and then ten minutes after publication, turn around and finally ask the central focus of the article for comment,"" Leetaru wrote.Then there's the broader political context to this story.Just a few weeks earlier, the Post had to basically retract another story, this one claiming Russian propaganda officials had spread fake news in the run-up to the election to help Donald Trump. The Vermont utility story also directly tied the breach to the Russian's alleged hack of the DNC.In other words, both of these fake news stories conveniently amplified the Democratic Party's narrative that Russia had tilted the election in Trump's favor. That's a serious breach of journalistic ethics if ever there was one.So what's the Post's response to all this? Essentially, nothing.In fact, when Washington Post blogger Erik Wemple  pressed his own paper for answers, he got the brushoff from the Post's PR department, which merely issued a statement saying, ""We have corrected the story, prominently displayed the correct information after further reporting, evaluated what transpired, and had the appropriate discussions internally to make sure something similar does not occur again.""Reporters would never let an energy company or a toy manufacturer or any other major corporation get away with that sort of cavalier response after a similarly spectacular failure in carrying out its basic mission. They shouldn't let the Post off the hook either.The public deserves a fuller accounting from a newspaper as influential as the Washington Post, and some clear evidence that it is taking concrete steps to ensure that it is honestly and fairly reporting the news, not making it up to help Democrats.RELATED:The Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream MediaDid Russia Help Trump Get Elected?

690,IP,"LAS VEGAS – Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) late Tuesday introduced a smaller, more powerful processor to run next-generation smartphones as well as augmented reality headsets and other mobile devices.The Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip is the first 10-nanometer node processor, Keith Kressin, senior vice president, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, said at a pre-CES press conference. The big consumer electronics trade show formally runs Thursday through Sunday, though media events began Tuesday.The Snapdragon 835 is 35% smaller than its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820. That will allow smartphone makers to pack more functionality or battery life into their devices, Kressin said.IBD'S TAKE: Usually, though not always, the chip industry is well represented on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks. See which chipmaker currently leads. Hint: Its CEO gives a CES keynote Wednesday evening.The new mobile chip also uses 25% less power than the previous chip.""That's a massive improvement generation to generation,"" Kressin said. Smartphone owners will get two and a half hours of additional use each day with the new chip, he said.The Snapdragon 835 was designed for better performance, longer battery life, faster connectivity and better image capture, Kressin said.The chip integrates gigabit-class LTE cellular speeds and multigigabit Wi-Fi speeds, he said.In addition to smartphones, Qualcomm envisions the Snapdragon 835 being used in VR and AR headsets, IP cameras, wearables, tablets and personal computers.The first announced products to use the Snapdragon 835 chip will be the ODG R-8 and R-9 augmented reality smartglasses from Osterhout Design Group.Jewelry designer Swarovski said it plans to use the chip in a new smartwatch to be introduced in March.The Snapdragon 835 is in production now and is expected to ship in commercial devices in the first half of 2017. Samsung Electronics is manufacturing the chips for Qualcomm.Qualcomm stock rose 7 cents in the stock market today to 65.47, as it seeks to regain its 50-day line.RELATED:Qualcomm Falls As S.

691,IP,"Cybersecurity: President Obama's decision to expel Russian diplomats for interfering with the U.S. election is starting to look like ""Alice in Wonderland""-style justice: sentence first, verdict afterward. Even some liberals are starting to wonder if the evidence against Russia holds water.Late last week, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint report that supposedly tied the Russian government into the release of hacked Democratic National Committee documents.But it didn't provide any such evidence. Instead, it simply listed tools used to carry out the attack, and asserted that Russia must have been the ones who used them.Then it devoted eight of the report's 13 pages to offering tips on how to prevent future cyberattacks.The problem is that the code identified in the report is ""an outdated malware developed by Ukrainians that can be downloaded online,"" according to the conservative news site the Daily Caller. In other words, anyone could have used it.The story quotes WordFence CEO Mark Maunder as saying that ""there is nothing in the IP data that points to Russia specifically.""Jeffrey Carr, writing for the liberal site The Intercept, also blasted the DHS/FBI report, saying that it ""adds nothing to the call for evidence that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC.""He goes on to say that ""this entire assignment of blame against the Russian government is looking more and more like a domestic political operation run by the White House that relied heavily on questionable intelligence generated by a for-profit cybersecurity firm with a vested interest.""Liberal columnist Matt Taibbi writes that ""nothing quite adds up"" with the Russian hacking story and admits that, based on the little we know, it could just be ""a cynical ass-covering campaign, by a Democratic Party that has seemed keen to deflect attention from its own electoral failures."" Taibbi rightly complains that journalists are running with a story based on nothing more than the word of ""secret assessments of intelligence agencies.""On Wednesday, BuzzFeed reported that ""no U.S. government entity has run an independent forensic analysis on the (DNC) system,"" but were relying on a private firm hired by the DNC after the hack was discovered. Given the gravity of the accusations, that's an astounding revelation.Added to these concerns is the fact that the mainstream press has been incredibly irresponsible in reporting on Russian actions during the election campaign. The Washington Post, for example, has all but retracted a bombshell story claiming that Russia conducted a sophisticated propaganda campaign to help Trump.On Friday, the Post offered up another bombshell — that Russia had infiltrated the U.S. electricity grid using the same malware they'd used to hack into the DNC. The story generated a huge response, but it, too, turned out to be false.A utility company in Vermont found the code on a laptop that wasn't in any way connected to the electric grid. Nor is there any evidence that Russia planted the malware on that particular laptop.Meanwhile, WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, stated emphatically over the weekend that Russian hackers were not the source of the DNC documents that his group posted in the run-up to the election.""We have said, repeatedly that over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party,"" Assange told Fox News' Sean Hannity.The bottom line is that we still don't know precisely what happened or why with the DNC hack. All we do know is that Democrats — from President Obama on down — have an obvious vested interest in blaming Russia, even if there's little actual evidence to support those accusations.RELATED:Obama's Sanctions On Russia Are Really Aimed At TrumpDid Russia Help Trump Get Elected?

745,IP,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) has earned rave reviews for its successful transition to a cloud computing business model from the legacy business model of selling perpetual-license software.Under CEO Shantanu Narayen, Adobe has evolved from a provider of mostly desktop software for creative professionals (think Photoshop and Illustrator) to a full-service provider of digital media and marketing software and services.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe is a key player for consumer-facing companies working to digitally transform their businesses. Adobe brings together content-creation tools with data insights — allowing companies to determine such things as which online marketing and advertising campaigns work best and how people are engaging with their content.After a five-year run-up to a record high of 111.09 on Oct. 24, Adobe stock has plateaued the past two months. It's stayed above its 200-day moving average since March, but has been tested at the 50-day support level since early November. Adobe stock closed Friday at 102.95, down a fraction.Narayen recently spoke with IBD about industry trends and his thoughts on the year ahead:IBD: How is Adobe helping companies digitally transform their operations?Narayen: When people think about digital transformation, among the things they think about is what's the customer journey and how do we map out that customer journey across all of the channels?Once we map out all of that customer journey across all of the channels, what's the segmentation of the customers that we're trying to target? And what are the campaigns we have to run in order to attract these customers? What's the experience they get when they interact with us?On the digital marketing side: enabling all of those digital experiences across all touch points — web, mobile apps, in-store devices. All of that is being delivered through digital marketing. But all of that content is being created through digital media.One of the things we say is: We're helping people make, manage, measure, monetize and mobilize that experience. The digital media side helps with the making and the managing in many ways, and the digital marketing helps in the monetization, measurement and mobilization of that experience.IBD: Is Adobe becoming more of a business intelligence company, helping enterprises make better decisions using all the data available nowadays?Narayen: We definitely believe that data is going to be more important. If you go back and look at why we bought Omniture in 2009, we said, ""We're going to be the Big Data company for marketers.""A big part of our technology agenda is all about: How do we normalize this data? How do we get insights from the data? How do we make it actionable for the enterprise to use that data in a pleasing manner for their customers?IBD: Where does Adobe's recently completed acquisition of advertising software platform provider TubeMogul fit in?Narayen: We have always been very bullish about video. For many years we have been saying that video is going to completely move to IP(internet protocol)-based networks.Adobe already has a leadership role on the video-content creation side with products like Premiere and After Effects. And we have a product called Primetime for the delivery and monetization of video content.IBD'S TAKE: The good news, Adobe ranks No. 1 in its industry group. The bad news, it's group ranks low. See what else you can learn about Adobe, or any stock, at IBD Stock Checkup.TubeMogul beefs up Primetime in that it becomes more of a one-stop shop for publishers and advertisers to monetize their video assets.IBD: You must be proud of the successful transformation of Adobe over these past few years.Narayen: I have to acknowledge and thank the incredible execution effort by Adobe employees. Externally, it has been written up as the textbook of transitions. Everybody now is trying to use our playbook. But it's the execution that sometimes gets taken for granted.We always had the right motivation, which is: How can we innovate at a faster pace? How can we aggressively acquire new customers and how can we continue to build a more predictable and recurring revenue stream?Customer satisfaction for our creative products is significantly higher because people know that as soon as there's a change in the environment Adobe is going to do it now rather than the traditional 12- or 18-month cycle (for the release of a new version of perpetual license software).As a product company focused on delivering innovation, as long as we can continue to have innovation front and center, everything else takes care of itself.We're in rarefied atmosphere in terms of companies that have the kind of top-line growth and bottom-line profitability and cash flow that we have.IBD: What can Washington do to support the tech industry?Narayen: The two things that would be top of mind for me are continued promotion of R&D and innovation, and looking at corporate competitiveness and taxation globally.We've had a history in this country of promoting R&D and innovation. As long as we can continue to promote R&D and innovation, that would be a good thing from the new administration.The second issue that's important to me is competitiveness, for ourselves and as a country, and corporate taxation. We continue to be one of the more heavily taxed countries. Like many tech companies, we have a lot of our funds offshore. So bringing that back and using that to drive more innovation and jobs in our country is near and dear to our heart at Adobe. RELATED:Adobe Systems Sees Clear Skies Ahead For Cloud Businesses

746,IP," It is axiomatic that if someone is sufficiently eager to disbelieve something, there is no Everest of evidence too large to be ignored. This explains today's revival of protectionism, which is a plan to make America great again by making it 1953 again.This was when manufacturing's postwar share of the labor force peaked at about 30%. The decline that began then was not caused by manufactured imports from today's designated villain, China, which was a peasant society. Rather, the war-devastated economies of competitor nations were reviving. And, domestically, the age of highly technological manufacturing was dawning.Since 1900, the portion of the American workforce in agriculture has declined from 40% to 2%. Output per remaining farmer and per acre has soared since millions of agricultural workers made the modernization trek from farms to more productive employment in city factories. Was this trek regrettable?According to a Ball State University study, of the 5.6 million manufacturing jobs lost between 2000 and 2010, trade accounted for 13% of job losses and productivity improvements accounted for more than 85%: ""Had we kept 2000-levels of productivity and applied them to 2010-levels of production, we would have required 20.9 million manufacturing workers (in 2010). Instead, we employed only 12.1 million.""Is this regrettable? China, too, is shedding manufacturing jobs because of productivity improvements.Douglas A. Irwin of Dartmouth College notes that Chinese imports may have cost almost one million manufacturing jobs in nearly a decade, but ""the normal churn of U.S. labor markets results in roughly 1.7 million layoffs every month."" He notes that here are more than 45 million Americans in poverty, ""stretching every dollar they have."" The apparel industry employs 135,000 Americans. Can one really justify tariffs that increase the price of clothing for the 45 million in order to save some of the 135,000 low-wage jobs? Anyway, if tariffs target apparel imports from China, imports will surge from other low-wage developing nations.The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip, who reports that there currently are 334,000 vacant manufacturing jobs, says that when Jimmy Carter tried to protect U.S. manufacturers by restricting imports of Japanese televisions, imports from South Korea and Taiwan increased. When those were restricted, Mexican and Singapore manufacturers benefited.In his book ""An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy,"" Marc Levinson recalls the 1970 agonies about Japanese bolts, nuts and screws. Under the 1974 Trade Act, companies or unions claiming ""serious injury"" — undefined by the law — from imports could demand tariffs to price the imports out of the market. Of the hundreds of U.S. bolt, nut and screw factories, some were, Levinson writes, ""highly automated, others so old that gloved workers held individual bolts with tongs to heat them in a forge.""A three-year 15% tariff enabled domestic producers to raise their prices, thereby raising the costs of many American manufacturers. By one estimate, each U.S. job ""saved"" cost $550,000 as the average bolt-nut-screw worker was earning $23,000 annually. And by the mid-1980s, inflation-adjusted sales of domestic makers were 15% below the 1979 level.Levinson notes that Ronald Reagan imposed ""voluntary restraints"" on Japanese automobile exports, thereby creating 44,100 U.S. jobs. But the cost to consumers was $8.5 billion in higher prices, or $193,000 per job created, six times the average annual pay of a U.S. autoworker. And there were job losses in sectors of the economy into which the $8.5 billion of consumer spending could not flow. The Japanese responded by sending higher-end cars, from which they made higher profits, which they used to build North American assembly plants and to develop more expensive and profitable cars to compete with those of U.S. manufacturers.In 2012, Barack Obama boasted that ""over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires."" But this cost about $900,000 per job, paid by American purchasers of vehicles and tires. And the Peterson Institute for International Economics says that this money taken from consumers reduced their spending on other retail goods, bringing the net job loss from the job-saving tire tariffs to around 2,500. And this was before China imposed retaliatory duties on U.S. chicken parts, costing the U.S. industry $1 billion in sales. Imports of low-end tires from Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico and elsewhere largely replaced Chinese imports.The past is prologue. The future probably will feature many more such self-defeating government interventions in the name of compassion as protectionist America tries to cower its way to being great again.

748,IP,"President-elect Donald Trump's stance on trade deals assumes unbalanced international trade agreements are domestic job killers. In the election, that won him favor in broad swathes of the country where globalization seems irrelevant, and foreigners and Washington alike are viewed with suspicion.So, what will happen to established trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), when Trump takes office Jan. 20?When NAFTA was finalized more than two decades ago, Ross Perot infamously predicted it would create ""a giant sucking sound"" of jobs leaving for Mexico. Since then, NAFTA has been blamed for our county's trade deficit with our North American trading partners. Trump said so himself during the general election, and promised to rip up or renegotiate the agreement in favor of a better deal for the American worker.Trump's passion for job creation is admirable and understandably popular. And he is correct on one point: NAFTA can be made better. But the fact is, the U.S. is always working to improve and strengthen existing trade agreements. Let's focus on the benefits of our existing agreements and addressing gaps in those agreements, rather than on disrupting the rules of engagement currently in place.Trade with Mexico has grown more than 450% since 1993, when the trade pact was signed. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico, our two largest export markets, support more than 3 million American jobs. Our two neighbors are among the biggest buyers of made-in-America goods and services in the world.Yet the U.S. runs a NAFTA deficit thanks to imports of fossil fuels and their byproducts, and automobiles. Remove them from the equation, and the U.S. would run a trade surplus with Mexico and Canada.Our northern neighbor is by far our largest foreign supplier of oil. The U.S. consumes about 70% of Canada's crude-oil exports. And Mexico is our fourth-largest oil supplier. And it's smart that we get our oil from our neighbors, given that it's such a critical resource and is tied to our national security.As for auto manufacturing, yes, it occurs in Mexico, but NAFTA also has brought foreign (Japanese, Korean and European) carmakers to North America. Without NAFTA, all the jobs those manufacturers brought to our shores wouldn't be here.The trade pact also stipulates content requirements. In cars exported from Mexico to the U.S., 62.5% of components must be from NAFTA countries. Given the growth in auto manufacturing since the inception of NAFTA, trade in U.S.-made auto components — parts, steel, textiles and more — has also grown.Could NAFTA be made better? Yes, but starting over and renegotiating the entire agreement isn't necessary to achieve strong, modern updates that would spur job growth and stimulate the U.S. economy.Fittingly, Trump's transition team on Dec. 5 calmed fears in Washington, softening the incoming administration's stance on the agreement.Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump transition team senior advisor, addressed concerns that Trump would rip up NAFTA upon entering office. ""I don't think we're looking to rip up NAFTA as much as we are looking to right-size it and make it fairer,"" Scaramucci said at a meeting held by the bipartisan group No Labels.This is welcome news. Abandoning current agreements would only create great uncertainty with our trading partners. The same agreements that enable the U.S. to set the rules for trade also allow us to update their provisions. And both Canada and Mexico have indicated they would agree to updates in NAFTA.For example, NAFTA's intellectual property (IP) provisions don't account for the rise of the internet and the digital economy. Adding language to NAFTA that recognizes the IP realities of the 21st century would modernize the agreement. Provisions should address cross-border data flows, prohibit forced data localization and reflect balanced copyright policy.Updating NAFTA to align policies that support innovation and further harmonize standards would reduce conflicting and costly energy-efficiency requirements, as well as other unnecessary technical trade barriers.Now is a good time to pivot from political rhetoric to reality. Supporting a valuable trade agreement with our neighbors, while modernizing it to one that strengthens our nation's economy and security, is a win-win for all. 
"
749,IP,"Stocks have rallied since Election Day for several reasons, but the prospect of tax cuts is a key reason. Analysts are sharpening their pencils and coming up with more specific numbers on the impact of corporate tax reform on earnings and the stock market.President-elect Donald Trump's Treasury secretary nominee, Steven Mnuchin, said this week that corporate tax reform will be a top priority for the incoming administration, with a 15% rate still the target.The current federal corporate rate is 35%, among the world's highest, with the effective rate at 29%.S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 11.8% to $131 per share in 2017, according to back-of-the-envelope estimates by S&P Global Market Intelligence analysts, with every 1 percentage point cut in the effective corporate tax rate boosting earnings by $1.31.IBD'S TAKE: Corporate tax reform is key evidence in the case for why investors have reason to be hopeful in the coming years.  Here's the case for a long-term Trump bull market.A five-point cut could hypothetically increase S&P 500 earnings by $6.55, while a 10-point cut would lift overall earnings to $144.09, the analysts said.What does that mean for stock prices?""The implications for stock market pricing are potentially dramatic,""  S&P Global Market Intelligence says.Using a forward price/earnings valuation ratio of 17 — vs. the current 17.4 — S&P Global Market Intelligence sees the the S&P 500 rising nearly 7% to 2,340 in Q1 2017 with a five-point tax cut, or 12% to 2,450 with a 10-point cut.S&P Global stressed that this offers a rough idea of the potential earnings and stock gains, not a comprehensive analysis.Some companies may benefit more from corporate tax cuts than others. New-economy titans such as Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amgen (AMGN) that rely heavily on intellectual property are able to shift various assets and sales to minimize their tax bills. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is another company with relatively low effective tax rates. General Electric (GE), which has plenty of IP assets and is pushing to be a leader in the industrial internet, also curbs its bill to the Treasury.The smaller impact from tax cuts could help explain why big-cap techs such as Apple and Alphabet have lagged while investors pour into energy, financial and materials sectors. Techs and other global firms would likely benefit from being able to repatriate massive overseas cash holdings, but that would spur a big run-up in the dollar.The dollar has hit fresh long-time highs since the election. A stronger greenback, all things being equal, would make U.S. exports less competitive and make the foreign operations of U.S. companies look less impressive in dollar terms. That would affect earnings for the globally focused S&P 500.Still, there's little doubt that overall a big cut in the effective corporate tax rate would be good for earnings and share prices.RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?

750,IP,"Video-processing chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA), a key supplier to action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), saw its stock dive on Friday, a day after the company offered a disappointing holiday-quarter outlook.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarella late Thursday posted better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, but investors focused on its weak Q4 guidance.Ambarella earned $1.11 a share excluding items, up 3% year over year, on sales of $100.5 million, up 8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Ambarella to earn 94 cents a share ex items on sales of $97.3 million.For the current quarter ending Jan. 31, Ambarella expects revenue of $84 million to $87 million, which would be up 26% at the midpoint. But Wall Street analysts were looking for $90.3 million. The company cited limited sales visibility and potentially high chip inventory levels with some consumer-focused customers for its cautious guidance.It expects gross profit margin on a non-GAAP basis to be 64% to 65.5%. That would be down from 66.3% in Q3.IBD'S TAKE: Ambarella stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 66, meaning it has outperformed 66% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But other chip stocks have performed better, including six on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks.Ambarella stock plummeted 11% to 54.47 on the stock market today. Ambarella stock has closed below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, for the last five days.""We are very proud to have achieved more than $100 million in revenue in the quarter, a new milestone,"" Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang said in a statement. ""We saw continued revenue growth in IP security, home monitoring and the automotive camera markets, as well as a ramp in revenue from action sports cameras for the holiday season.""Ambarella makes chips for action cameras, flying-camera drones, security cams, dashboard cams and body-worn police cameras.GoPro, which accounted for about 30% of Ambarella's revenue in Q3, announced a corporate restructuring on Wednesday. On Nov. 3, GoPro badly missed Q3 sales and earnings targets and gave weak Q4 guidance.Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay reiterated his buy rating on Ambarella, but trimmed his price target to 84 from 87.Investment bank Stifel kept its buy rating but cut its price target on Ambarella to 84 from 86.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained his hold rating on Ambarella because of concerns about slowing sales of GoPro Hero cameras. Plus, GoPro has given no word on when it expects to return to the drone market following its recent Karma product recall.Ambarella has diversified its customer base with recent wins for video chips in dashcams from Mercedes and Toyota (TM), in the DJI Mavic Pro portable drone, and in the Spectacles sunglasses from Snap, formerly Snapchat.RELATED:GoPro Stock Rallies On Plan To Cut Jobs, CostsGoPro Crashes On Karma Drone Recall Just 16 Days After Launch

824,IP,"So Twitter (TWTR) both beats and misses at the same time.......posting softer user growth - 320 mil avg monthly users vs. the expectation of 324 mil users - while also offering guidance that was less than upbeat.....BUT - they did beat on the top line - Revenues were $569 mil vs. exp of $559.6 mil.... the stock traded off 13% in after hours trading...but look....they had taken the stock up 30% off the lows of Oct 2 (the same day that they announced the appointment of Jack Dorsey as CEO) at $24.34.....so now they gave back 10% on this 'miss'.......so net net...the stock is still up 18% from those lows....was this is a classic 'buy the rumor/sell the fact' reaction? I mean it seems that Twitter always misses on user growth, so what's the big deal?
"
825,IP," Now Apple  (AAPL) on the other hand - BEAT, BEAT, and slightly missed.... Beat on earnings, beat on revenue, but missed on IPhones sales targets - ..expectation was that they would sell 48.5 million units and they ONLY sold 48.05 mil units - Can you believe that? They ONLY sold 48.05 mil units! But even that still represents a 22% y/y increase in growth!.... So? What's the fuss? Now analysts pay very close attn to the 'units sold' to see if Apple can continue to grow this number - but the concern is - Will Apple become a victim of its own success? 
"
826,IP,"The stock traded up $3 in afterhours trading or 2%. and is currently trading at $116.56 in the early morning session..... Now look - They have taken the stock up 12% from the Oct lows of $107.31.....Last week when the chatter started about a possible miss - they gave back 3.5% and churned there until today.....So - net net - the stock is still up 8% for the month....Now that is all well and good if you bought the stock on Oct 2.. but if you bought it on the 23rd...then yeah....You are NOT really happy.....But hey - trading is not for the faint of heart.... 
"
827,IP,"Yesterday - for the most part traders continued to avoid making any big commitments ahead of today's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) monetary policy announcement.....Yesterday's action was a 'repeat' of the muted action on Monday as traders and investors really just sat on the sidelines...waiting and waiting.. 
"
828,IP,"Now the broader mkt essentially traded flat, but the transportation index (otherwise known as the 'Trannies') got hammered. (The Dow Transport Index is an index of 20 US transportation stocks....Airlines, truckers, rails etc... all stocks that are directly connected to the transportation of goods) Now why would this be so? A couple of reasons that all suggest a building global slowdown...... 
"
829,IP,"1. Yesterday's eco data - Durable Goods report - was not encouraging at all - it showed a continuing decline in durable goods orders for another month. Durable goods orders slid by 1.2% in September following a revised 3.0% decline in August. If we take out transportation equipment - durable goods orders still fell by 0.4% in September after declining by 0.9% in August. (Durable Goods are those goods that are not quickly consumed or replaced often - so think of appliances, cars, computers, home or office furnishings etc...) 
"
830,IP,"2. Consumer confidence showed a sharp retreat in September 3. Continued oil weakness So taken together - these data points indicate that a slowdown and loss of confidence and means less goods will be shipped. And if companies are shipping less goods then it makes sense that the trannies get hammered. And they did...the index was off 2.6% or 218 pts. Small caps also took it on the chin...and why? Because if investors believe that a recession or slowdown is on the horizon - they would rather put their money in 'Value Stocks - defined as 'large, safer, dividend paying American Blue Chips vs. the risk of small cap 'growth stocks'. So today is FED day...as if you didn't know that.....and stocks will remain in this holding pattern until precisely 2 pm.....(or maybe 1:59:30 if you 'BUY' access to the headlines before they actually hit the tape....but that is another story for another day...). 
"
831,IP,"The FED is not expected to change a thing.....rates will remain at zero....but do expect strategists and analysts to pull apart the statement 'word by word' looking for any clue as to FUTURE policy actions.....Really? Look - global stocks have been propelled higher because the ECB (European Central Bank) and the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) launched additional stimulus - so now the only question is - Will Janet join in the party and serve up more Kool Aid? And if so - the stocks look relatively cheap in zero interest rate environment.....and cheap means a bargain and a bargain means that buyers will come in - at least for today.... Rue the day that all this free money just stops..... But let's not go there right now.... 
"
832,IP,"Overnight in Asia - mkts were mostly lower.....volumes were light as investors await the FED action.......continued weakness in commodities - oil, copper etc keeping the lid on...... Japan was the standout - rising by 0.68% as many await the BoJ (Bank of Japan) policy announcement next week. The expectation is that they will announce MORE KOOL AID for everyone! In Europe - mkts are all a bit higher....because they believe that the FED will do nothing and if so - then stocks will rally..... couple that with some good earnings and it's off to the races! FTSE +0.39%, CAC 40 +0.34%, DAX +0.64%, EUROSTOXX + 0.61%, SPAIN +0.32% and ITALY +0.88%. US futures are up 4 pts in early trading.... finding support yesterday at 2060 which is also the , now flattening out, 200 dma.......If we hold here then a surge up to 2100 is not out of the question at all.....if the mkt becomes disappointed with what they hear out of the FED then the a move back to the 2035 level would not be a surprise at all..... 
"
833,IP,"The focus is not about today...but about the future moves that the FED will make and that will depend upon how they position today's policy statement.... In the end though, I do not expect rates to rise in 2015 at all. They have successfully kicked that can into the 1Q of 2016..... Earnings today include: Hershey (HSY), General Dynamics (GD), International Paper (IP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Valero Energy (VLO) , and the owner of the NYSE - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

Yet China poses a significant threat to our nation's all important manufacturing sector.Right now there is an intensive cyberwar waged against the U.S. by China, in which the Chinese are aggressively hacking into thousands of U.S. companies, stealing their intellectual property, and then flooding markets with their own ripped-off, competing products. Even worse, China is ""dumping"" these products into the U.S. at prices so low that they could eventually drive our manufacturing industry out of business.Sadly, there are too many examples of China's illegal activities to mention here, but a top example is China's nonstop campaign to undermine the U.S. steel industry, the backbone of our manufacturing. Chinese actions will have disastrous consequences if left unchecked.U.S. Steel invested millions in the development of a lighter, stronger steel. The company is presently suing 30 Chinese companies and their distributors, saying Chinese hackers stole trade secrets for this steel and China is now manufacturing its own copycat steel products and dumping the products into the U.S. at prices so low that they are impossible to match.In 2000, China produced approximately 14% of the world's steel, according to the World Steel Association. China is now manufacturing nearly half of all the world's steel products and last year, exported 112 million metric tons of steel, a 20% increase over a record-setting 2014.At a time when domestic energy production has skyrocketed and labor costs are coming down, the United States should be experiencing a manufacturing revival. Instead, the U.S. steel industry has been the target of continued illegal foreign practices and suffered 16,000 layoffs since the beginning of 2015, with more job losses expected throughout steel-producing communities.Unfortunately, China's cyber-thievery is not limited to the steel industry. A 2013 report from a bipartisan Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property stated, ""The scale of international theft of American intellectual property (IP) is unprecedented — hundreds of billions of dollars per year, on the order of the size of U.S. exports to Asia.""It concludes, ""China is the world's largest source of IP theft.""The FBI acknowledges an alarming increase in the theft of American trade secrets. An official with the counterintelligence unit was quoted last year as saying American companies have lost hundreds of billions of dollars due to theft of trade secrets. The FBI surveyed 165 private companies and found that half of them had fallen victim to IP theft, with 95% of those cases linked to Chinese cyber-hackers.Sources at the Justice Department also acknowledge a relentless wave of cybercrime saying thousands of companies in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy have been targeted by the Chinese. Counterintelligence officials also say that despite public pledges by China to end cybertheft, there is no indication that China's hackers have backed off.Cyberattacks threaten our national defense as well. The Washington Post reports that it's believed Chinese cyber-spies are responsible for hacking into major defense companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The spies obtained data and designs for more than two dozen major military weapons systems, including aircraft designs, missile defense, and communications.And it's not just steel and defense companies, corporations across a gamut of industries are victims of cybertheft. Hackers allegedly stole years of emerging energy technology research from SolarWorld and Westinghouse Electric. Paint company Valspar lost $20 million, or one-eighth of its annual profit, after its proprietary information was stolen by a Chinese rival.Chinese cyber-thieves have become so adept and skillful, they are even hacking into companies to view international trade strategies, bidding information and other forms of proprietary data that give China's manufacturing industry a decisive leg-up in world markets.China is not only expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, but also has created a massive cyberattack army that works every day to crush American companies by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property. Donald Trump and the incoming Congress must demonstrate strong support for our companies and help punish cyberattackers, and they must invest more in U.S. counterintelligence capabilities so that America can win what so far has been a devastating cyberwar.

852,IP,"How is Comcast’s (CMCSA) $15-per-month Web-based TV service, called Stream, doing? Comcast, the nation’s biggest cable TV firm, launched Stream in Boston and Chicago last quarter. Comcast's Stream service targets broadband-only homes, mainly millennials who have never subscribed to pay TV services. No set-top box is required, and Stream works with Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku and other devices.With Stream, Comcast got the jump on Apple, which has been delayed in launching its expected Web TV service.Comcast included Stream subscribers in its surprising 89,000 net video subscriber additions in Q4.But Comcast did not break out how many Stream subscribers it has. “Stream is in the numbers, but I don't think it moves the needle a lot,” UBS analyst John Hodulik told IBD in an email.Comcast has stated plans to bring Stream to its entire cable TV territory in 2016. Comcast's Stream service includes the major live broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- along with HBO and local TV channels.Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit, on the company's earnings conference call Wednesday, said ""it's probably too early to say what it (Stream) will be, what it will turn into over time. But we feel good about the usage and good about the product. It's a good value proposition for the customer, and we'll continue to roll it out to other markets.""The Federal Communications Commission is likely curious about how Stream is doing in hard numbers, given that the agency has been asking questions about the Web service related to its net neutrality rules. The problem, according to critics, is that Comcast does not count its own Stream service toward the monthly data caps of its broadband customers. Comcast says the Stream service is not a net neutrality issue because the service uses IP technology over its own network, not the public Internet, to reach households.A federal court is expected to rule on the FCC’s net neutrality rules in April. The agency's clout could again be gutted -- or not, which might lead to more enforcement of the new net neutrality rules.Comcast joins Dish Network (DISH) in mashing new Web streaming video subscribers along with traditional pay TV customers in earnings reports. In Dish’s case, new subscribers to its $20-per-month Sling Web TV service have helped offset its loss of satellite TV customers.Dish discussed Sling subscriber additions for the first time when reporting Q2 earnings in early August. Sling had 240,000 subscribers as of June 30.Dish Network did not update Sling’s subscriber total when reporting Q3 earnings. Goldman Sachs has forecast that Sling could hit 2 million by the end of 2016.For Comcast, Stream numbers might be more material by the time it reports Q1 earnings. Comcast’s 89,000 video subscriber additions in Q4 were way up from 6,000 in the year-earlier period.Aside from launching Stream, Comcast has also stepped up its promotion of lower-priced skinny bundles, with fewer TV channels and broadband-first promotions to college students.Analysts say its deployment of  Internet-ready X1 set-top boxes and improved customer service have improved video subscriber results.On Comcast’s earnings call, Smit played down the impact of  lower-revenue skinny bundles. He said 75% of video subscribers added in the December quarter had “higher-end packages.”

858,IP,"The latest dump of Hillary Clinton's State Department emails so far hasn't produced much more than a few chuckles and a furrowed brow or two. If there's anything incriminating in this batch, it's been redacted as classified and is therefore not available to the media or public.Of the thousands of personal emails that the State Department released at 9 p.m. Monday — conveniently for prime media exposure, we're sure — 125 contained classified material. Naturally Camp Clinton will argue they were marked as classified only just before their release, not while Clinton handled them, so it can maintain the fiction that there was nothing classified in her personal email.But as we've said before, this is a nothing argument. As secretary of state, she should have known the material was too sensitive to move through personal email even if it wasn't considered classified at the time. If she didn't know this, then she is not someone who can be trusted with national secrets, not even small ones.The more interesting Clinton email scandal story in the Monday-Tuesday news cycle was actually an exclusive from Breitbart News that told us that Clinton ""Shared An Email Network With The Clinton Foundation.""""Hillary Clinton's private email server was housed at the same physical location and on the same network as an email server used and operated by the Clinton Foundation,"" Breitbart reported.""Records reveal that Hillary Clinton's private clintonemail.com server shared an IP address with her husband Bill Clinton's email server, presidentclinton.com, and both servers were housed in New York City, not in the basement of the Clintons' Chappaqua, N.Y., home.""We're not computer experts. But this has the look of negligence all over it. How vulnerable were Clinton's emails, both those she sent and those she received, if the server they were on was on a shared network with a private foundation? If Clinton Foundation email, which would not be nearly as secure as State Department email, were hacked, then once the hackers figured out the shared IP number, their job just got easier. That makes her emails essentially an open book.And then there's the issue of who fixed the server when it crashed, which, according to National Review, happened frequently. Where did the Clintons find someone with a security clearance who could get the service running again?Clinton could have avoided these questions about her judgment had she only chosen to use a secure State Department email and device rather than her own email and personal devices.Of course there'd be other questions about her judgment, particularly over the Benghazi attacks, the incident that prompted Freedom of Information Act and congressional investigation requests for her emails in the first place.But this is a Clinton problem. It's not about serving the nation, the people and a shared idea of liberty and prosperity. It's about using political office to serve themselves.

EPS fell 2 cents vs. Q3 2014, whereas revenue jumped 6.5%.Synopsys beat the consensus forecast of seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters who expected 59 cents per share for earnings on $555.4 million in revenue.For Q4, Synopsys guided to between $570 million and $585 million in revenue and between 65 cents and 67 cents non-GAAP EPS, which would be up 3% at the midpoint vs. Q4 2014.Pham also hoisted Synopsys' 2015 revenue guidance to between $2.23 billion and $2.24 billion, an increase from the $2.21 billion to $2.24 billion forecast in Q2.Historically, Synopsys has lagged Mentor Graphics (MENT) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) in the emulator business, Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg wrote in a research report.""But, it seems Synopsys' strategy of focusing on integrating its simulation, verification and emulation tool in the 'verification continuum' is paying off,"" she said.The verification continuum is Synopsys' name for its software-verification platform, on which customers use the company's products in conjunction with one another.Garg called the company's Q3 ""a good beat"" and estimated Synopsys' IP revenue could grow into the double digits with the burgeoning use of IP in chip design.Garg suggested Synopsys may have also scooped an emulation contract — ""Intel, in our view"" — from Mentor.She maintained her 60 price target on Synopsys stock and reiterated an overweight rating.Thomas Diffely, of DA Davidson, hiked his price target on Synopsys stock to 60 from 56 and rated it a buy.Despite the temporary dilution, Diffely sees Synopsys ultimately garnering profit stemming from the $125 million it spent in Q3 acquisitions.""SNPS is building a meaningful presence in these growth markets that should ultimately drive earnings,"" he wrote in a research report.Connect with Allison Gatlin: Twitter | Facebook.

907,IP,"Whatever Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reveals in the coming week about building an electric-car battery factory, it's sure to fuel speculation about where Tesla can go with it, and one other thing: round-the-clock solar power.
"
908,IP,"Synergies between Tesla and cousin company SolarCity (SCTY) don't end with Musk.
"
909,IP,"Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity. More insights on synergies might come out when SolarCity reports its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. And more clues could emerge from the ""Tesla Gigafactory"" conference call that Musk plans in the coming week.
"
910,IP,"Besides being CEO of Tesla, Musk is chairman and a major shareholder at SolarCity, where his cousin is CEO. Musk also helms privately held commercial space flight company SpaceX.
"
911,IP,"Luxury electric-car maker Tesla needs more batteries than it can get in order to eventually build an electric car at prices that would compete with the mainstream BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, by Volkswagen (VLKAY).
"
912,IP,"Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo bottom-lined it this way in a research note Tuesday: ""The launch of low-cost Gen III vehicles relies on the ability to reduce battery costs. If TSLA is unable to significantly reduce battery costs through economies of scale or technological advances, it may prove challenging to produce vehicles at the $35,000 price point without reductions in performance.""

913,IP,"Tesla agrees. Musk closed his Q4 shareholder letter on Wednesday with a tease about the planned battery factory and its ramifications for home-and-business solar installer SolarCity.
"
914,IP,"""Very shortly, we will be ready to share more information about the Tesla Gigafactory,"" he said.

916,IP,"Storing Solar Energy
"
917,IP,"Solar panels on home or business rooftops deliver energy while the sun is shining, but adding what's essentially a big battery can allow the excess to be stored for use during cloudy days or at night — and can also smooth solar's spiky delivery back to the electric grid. Making the battery packs affordable and small enough has proved to be a challenge.
"
918,IP,"Utility-scale power systems don't use conventional batteries but have started to store energy using molten sand and other approaches.
"
919,IP,"Regarding Tesla's battery factory plans and SolarCity, Kallo told IBD: ""I do think they're building out capacity with that in mind — Elon is chairman of and has sizable interest in SolarCity, so I think that will play an important part in offtake of the battery factory.""
"
920,IP,"He says SolarCity will ultimately benefit, ""but Tesla will benefit the most.""
"
921,IP,"""They have the technology and IP (intellectual property) around the battery chemistry,"" Kallo said. But ""we're still a couple years from it making a big difference.""
"
922,IP,"Analysts expect Tesla's current lithium ion battery partner Panasonic will play a role in the factory. And after word about Tesla talks with Apple (AAPL) surfaced recently, analyst Kallo told IBD that Apple could conceivably be an additional user of batteries made at the plant.

924,IP,"That company's CEO, Lyndon Rive, told IBD in September that ""a couple hundred"" Tesla-aided solar systems were being deployed — mostly in California — with what is called the DemandLogic power storage system. In December the plan went formal, as SolarCity introduced an energy storage plan for business customers.
"
925,IP,"Besides storing energy, on a nothing-down service plan that aims to trim power bills, SolarCity touts the DemandLogic system, with Tesla battery technology, as a way to ""power IT functions, security systems, cash registers and other critical business systems during power outages.""

947,IP,"On Tuesday, International Paper (IP) delivered a couple of pieces of good news for investors. The paper giant announced a big increase to its dividend and unveiled a large stock buyback.
"
948,IP,"International Paper hiked its dividend by 17% to 35 cents a share per quarter. This will be paid Dec. 16 to shareholders of record Nov. 15. Previously it boosted its dividend in October. International Paper's dividend has nearly doubled from the amount it paid in March of 2011.
"
949,IP,"With the latest raise, the company pays $1.40 a share annually, giving its stock a yield of 2.8%. International Paper has one of the highest yields among the 12 dividend-paying stocks in the Paper & Paper Products group.
"
950,IP,"International Paper also said it will buy back up to $1.5 billion of its own shares over the next two to three years. The company will repurchase the shares in the open market. Stock buybacks can increase earnings per share, as net income is divided by a smaller number of outstanding shares.
"
951,IP,"In the past few years, International Paper has had a rocky earnings history. Earnings fell in three of the past five years. This is why it has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 28 and a five-year stability of 45. Generally, it's best to see Earnings Stability Factors of 20 or less.
"
952,IP,"Sales also have seen ups and downs. But the firm has put together a streak of six straight quarters of rising revenues.
"
953,IP,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% this year and 35% in 2014.
"
954,IP,"International Paper last broke out past a 49.04 buy point from a cup-with-handle base July 25. Big buyers failed to return after that one-day show of strength. The stock is now in a flat base or shallow cup pattern with a 50.43 buy point.On Tuesday, International Paper (IP) delivered a couple of pieces of good news for investors. The paper giant announced a big increase to its dividend and unveiled a large stock buyback.International Paper hiked its dividend by 17% to 35 cents a share per quarter. This will be paid Dec. 16 to shareholders of record Nov. 15. Previously it boosted its dividend in October. International Paper's dividend has nearly doubled from the amount it paid in March of 2011.With the latest raise, the company pays $1.40 a share annually, giving its stock a yield of 2.8%. International Paper has one of the highest yields among the 12 dividend-paying stocks in the Paper & Paper Products group.International Paper also said it will buy back up to $1.5 billion of its own shares over the next two to three years. The company will repurchase the shares in the open market. Stock buybacks can increase earnings per share, as net income is divided by a smaller number of outstanding shares.In the past few years, International Paper has had a rocky earnings history. Earnings fell in three of the past five years. This is why it has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 28 and a five-year stability of 45. Generally, it's best to see Earnings Stability Factors of 20 or less.Sales also have seen ups and downs. But the firm has put together a streak of six straight quarters of rising revenues.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% this year and 35% in 2014.International Paper last broke out past a 49.04 buy point from a cup-with-handle base July 25.

"
956,IP,"New Home Sales in July fell 0.7% from June, to a rate of 298,000. Relative to a year ago, sales are up 6.8%. While the year-over-year rebound is more than welcome, it is still a very dismal rate of New Home sales.
"
957,IP,"Also, there was a downward revision to the June numbers of 12,000 to 300,000. Thus, relative to where we thought we were, it could be seen as a 4.5% decrease. The July level was worse than the expected rate of 310,000.
"
958,IP,"The 15 lowest months on record (back to 1963) for new home sales have all been in the last 15 months. New home sales have only exceeded the 400,000 level three times since September of 2008 when the financial markets collapsed. The most recent time was in April 2010, as sales were inflated by the rush to get in under the wire and collect the homebuyer tax credit. Sales collapsed after that, and July comp is thus an easy one.
"
959,IP,"Relative to the peak of the housing bubble (7/05, 1.389 million), new home sales are down 78.5%. Prior to September 2008, there had only been 20 months in which new home sales were below the 400,000 level, with the most recent being in 1982. The graph below shows the history of new homes sales (blue, left scale) along with the growth in population (red, right scale), since presumably if you have more people, you will need more places for them to live.
"
960,IP,"Take a very close look at the relationship between new home sales and the grey recession bars. New home sales fall sharply before all recessions (with the exception of the dot.com bust-caused recession of 2001) and then start to increase sharply in the middle of, or towards the end of, the recession. That clearly is not happening this time around.
"
961,IP,"If you want to know why the recovery has been anemic so far, look no further than the graph above! New home sales are vital to the overall economy. If new homes are not selling, then homebuilders have no reason to build more of them. After all, that is very expensive inventory to sit on.
"
962,IP,"Unlike used home sales, each new home built creates a huge amount of economic activity. Not only are low new home sales bad for the big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), but also for all the companies that make the products and supplies that go into making a new house. They range from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) for bricks, roofing materials and insulation to Fortune Brands (FO) for plumbing fixtures and cabinets to USG (USG  -  Free Report) for wallboard to PPG Industries (PPG for glass and paint.
"
963,IP,"In terms of employment, it is not just all the roofers and framers that lose jobs due to weak new home sales, but employees at all the firms that make the stuff that goes into making a new home. Of course, if those employees are out of work, they are not spending on other goods and services dragging down a host of seemingly unrelated businesses.
"
964,IP,"Not that the direct impact of construction jobs should be underestimated. Since the recession started, almost 30% jobs lost have come from the construction industry.New Home Inventories
"
965,IP,"Inventories of new homes were down 0.6% on the month and are down 21.4% from a year ago. The months of supply is at 6.6 months -- unchanged from June, but down from 9.0 months a year ago. That is well off the peak of 12.1 months, and is now just slightly above normal. A healthy market has about a 6 month supply of new houses and during the bubble, 4 months was the norm, as is shown in the graph below (from http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/).
"
966,IP,"Of course, used homes are very good substitutes for a new home, and last week we found out that the months of supply for used homes was 9.4 months, up from 9.2 months in June suggests downward pressure on existing home prices (and more foreclosure problems), which will continue to make life tough for the housing industry.
"
967,IP,"The absolute level of new home inventories is at a record low; near normal months supply is entirely due to the low sales rate. Inventories of new homes have now fallen for (at least) 30 straight months. Eventually population growth and a higher rate (more normal) of household formation will absorb the excess inventory.
"
968,IP,"Given the extremely low levels of new home starts, one does not have to imagine very high absolute levels to generate some very fancy-looking percentage increases. The third graph, also from http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/), tracks the history of new home inventories. Note that inventories have declined at all three levels. The biggest decline has come in homes under construction. The decline in the absolute level of inventories is good news, but is swamped by the still very high level of inventories of used homes.Results by Region
"
969,IP,"Regionally, the numbers were very mixed. The numbers in the Northeast were very strong, with sales doubling on the month but down 3.4% from a year ago. The Northeast is, however, by far the smallest of the four regions and low absolute numbers can make for some pretty big percentage changes. The absolute number was just 28,000, up from 14,000 last month. In June it accounted for just 9.3% of all new homes sold, up from 4.7% in June.
"
970,IP,"Relative to last month, sales in the Midwest were up 2.4%, but they were unchanged from a year ago. In the West, sales were down by 5.9% from last month but up 45.5% from last year. The South, by far the largest of the four regions (54.7% of total in July) saw a drop of 7.4% for the month and unchanged from last year.Worse Than Expected
"
971,IP,"This report was worse than expected, and we got a downward revision to last month. The absolute level continues to be dismal. In other words, it was an ugly report.
"
972,IP,"With the prices of used houses weak, it makes selling a new home that much tougher. After all, a used home is a very good substitute for a new home. The housing sector has been a major drag on the economy for several years now. As Residential Investment is now a very small part of the overall economy (and new home construction is the largest part of, but not all of it), further drops in new home construction will not hurt the economy much going forward, but it sure would be nice to see it on the positive side of the ledger. That will happen eventually.  
"
973,IP,"Historically, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, July is a slightly weaker month than June for new home sales. The history of raw, unadjusted sales is shown in the next graph (also from http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/). Note the sharp decline from April to May last year, due to the tax credit effect, which is not in place this year.Lack of ""Household Formation""
"
974,IP,"The main problem right now for housing demand is the very low rate of household formation. Instead of moving out to get their own place, people in their 20’s are being forced to live with Mom and Dad, since they don’t have a job that will pay the rent or support a mortgage. Since residential investment is such an important swing factor in creating jobs in the country (both directly and indirectly) that sets up a huge ""chicken and the egg"" problem.
"
975,IP,"We are not in a robust recovery yet, but the seeds have been planted. It is unlikely that they will germinate this summer, and it may take longer than that, but eventually they will sprout.
"
976,IP,"The lack of a housing recovery is the key difference between this recovery and every other one which has preceded it. The collapse of the housing sector is directly responsible for a quarter of the jobs lost, and indirectly responsible for many more than that. The loss of jobs has in turn depressed household formation, and thus further depressed the housing market.
"
977,IP,"Even extremely low mortgage rates have not been enough to get things going again. We still have extremely high vacancy rates, both of apartments and of houses sitting empty, although lately we have seen some improvement in the rental market.
"
978,IP,"Until that excess is absorbed, it is unlikely that we will get anything like a robust housing sector, although even a tripling of the new home sales rate from current levels would bring us to what was considered a normal rate of sales back in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Back then we had far fewer people, and thus a lower need for places for people to live. Like a kidney stone, this too shall pass.
"
979,IP,"New home sales are awful, have been awful for some time now and show few signs of getting better anytime soon. This is going to be an ongoing drag on the economy for awhile yet. When the housing market -- particularly the new home market -- comes to life, it will be the spark that can ignite a strong self-sustaining recovery, but it does not seem likely to happen anytime soon.

"
981,IP,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things -- a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks Rank #1 and 2 stocks than #4 or 5 ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week.
"
982,IP,"One industry that looks promising right now based on the Zacks Rank is Paper. It is currently in 18th place overall out of 205 industries ranked, and it climbed five spots this week. The average Zacks rank for the group is 2.35. With a total of 17 firms in the group, that is a very impressive average. Normally, the bigger the group in terms of the number of companies, the more the group average will be close to 3.00 (hence the sectors shown below all range between 2.73 and 3.21).
"
983,IP,"The closely related Wood Products industry does not fare quite as well, sitting in 43rd place with a 2.67 average rank, but it is coming up quickly, gaining 65 spots in the last week. The lumberjacks are OK (cue the ""Monty Python"" music).
"
984,IP,"Some of the firms of note in those groups that have earned the coveted Zacks Rank #1 are: Clearwater Paper (CLW  -  Free Report), Neenah Paper (NP  -  Free Report) and Universal Forest Products (UFPI). All three of those are small caps. Investors looking for a larger name might consider #2 ranked International Paper (IP  -  Free Report).
"
985,IP,"The Chemical industry, broadly speaking, is also showing some strength. There are several sub-industries that we track. The strongest of these was Chemical-Plastics, which was in 9th place, up 32 spots in a week with a 2.50 average rank. It is a small industry with small-cap firms in it.
"
986,IP,"The big boys of the industry are not doing all that bad, either. The Diversified Chemicals, which is where you find most of the big, well-known firms, came in in 41st place, up four spots with an average rank of 2.65. The Specialty Chemical industry was right on its heels in 42nd place, up 3 spots on the week with an average rank of 2.66. Some of the bigger-cap names with Zacks Rank #1 ratings from those two groups include Dow Chemical (DOW), Solutia (SOA) and W.R. Grace (GRA  -  Free Report).
"
987,IP,"Both the Paper and Chemical industries are very sensitive to the overall level of economic activity. Their strong ranks are more evidence that the economy is coming back.

989,IP,"This week’s video covers two companies where management has made key decisions for the future of their respective companies; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), and International Paper (IP  -  Free Report).Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has the largest market capitalization for any U.S. healthcare company at just under $330 billion.  The company’s Q1 earnings report beat both top and bottom line expectations with earnings and revenues improving by +12.6% year over year.  Most importantly the Pharma segment, which accounts for almost half of the company’s total revenues had sales improve by +19%. But after the earnings report, the stock price began to fall as worries about increasing competition from generic drugs would negatively impact Pharma sales.  While JNJ has a nice pipeline of new drugs, and high expectations for its cancer and stroke prevention medications the segment was susceptible to encroachment by generic competitors.  To counter this threat, management announced that it has about $50 billion available for acquisitions.  Further, management commented that they were not looking to make one big $50 billion splash, rather they were looking to make many smaller acquisitions.  These acquisitions are expected to bolster its drug pipeline for the next several years. To add to this good news, JNJ recently announced that they accepted Platinum Equity’s $2.1 billion offer to sell the LifeScan business (diabetes treatments).  This deal is expected to close in late 2018.  Moreover, management revealed that Fortive Corp made a $2.8 billion offer to purchase the Advanced Sterilization Products Business, which if accepted would close in early 2019. These proceeds from the sale of these units are expected to go into its acquisition pool, share repurchase program, and to be used for an increased dividend payment.  Currently, JNJ is in a very unique group called Dividend Kings; a company that has increased dividend payments each year for the past 50 consecutive years.  The company has a current annual dividend yield of +2.94%.Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the graph below, the stock price had been on a steady upwards trend since the third quarter 2015.  When the markets peaked in January of 2018, the stock price then fell for the next several months due to generic competition worries.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteMany analysts have stated that JNJ’s current stock price provides a great buying opportunity with plenty of upside growth potential.  This is due to the sale of underperforming assets, its acquisition power, and strong dividend payment.  Overall, the long-term outlook for the company is very strong.International Paper (IP  -  Free Report) has been doing very well for the past several quarters.  In its most recent earnings report the company beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates with earnings growing by +59% while revenues improved by about +2%.  While revenues beat expectations they were not overly impressive. To improve revenues management announced an increase in pricing for all three of the company’s primary products; printing papers, cellulose fibers, and containerboard.  This move is expected to accelerate both cash flows and earnings over the next several quarters.  Further, in the first four months the company has seen box shipments improve by +1.9%.  This indicates that the upswing in pricing has not impacted demand and subsequent sales. The new cash flows are expected to be funneled into a share repurchase initiative and or an increase in the company’s dividend.  Currently, the company has a +3.3% annual dividend yield. The new pricing power has caused analyst estimates to increase for the next two quarters, and for FY 18 & FY 19. As you can see in the table below, this was not a one-time increase in target prices, but estimates have been repeatedly increased over the past 90 days.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM score of A.  Therefore the near and long-term outlook for the company is very solid.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

"
990,IP,"The first quarter earnings season is all but over, with just a handful companies having not reported.
"
991,IP,"We can draw a couple of conclusions about the results. First is that there is a serious dichotomy between growth as measured by the median EPS growth rate and as measured by the total net income growth. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago. More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
992,IP,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year over year EPS growth rate is 9.0%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While that is short of the sort of double-digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the handful of firms yet to report is for 5.7% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 3.03%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
993,IP,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.3:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. The Financials have been responsible for 32.1% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 18.9% of the total firms reporting.
"
994,IP,"On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.43) and Industrials (5.50). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.00, has the second highest median surprise, at 7.23%. Telecom has the best median surprise at 8.00%, even though its surprise ratio is just 1.67. However, given the very small number of firms in the Telecom sector (9), medians of any sort are less meaningful than sectors with large numbers of firms in them.
"
995,IP,"In terms of year-over-year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the Energy firms reporting year over year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 21.5% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 17.4%. Honorable (double-digit) mentions go to Telecom, Health Care and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
996,IP,"With the first quarter season over, it is time to turn our attention to the second quarter expectations. The bar is not set very high with the EPS at the median firm expected to be just 5.56% higher than a year ago. After factoring in the probability that there will be more positive surprises than disappointments, it most likely means that median year-over-year EPS growth for the S&P 500 as a whole will be around 8.0%. By sector, the broad outline suggests that the second quarter should be very similar to the first quarter. Energy and Tech are currently to again hold gold and silver, respectively, and Health Care may nudge out the Industrials for the Bronze. Financials and Consumer Discretionary are expected to again bring up the rear, with performances that are even worse than in the first quarter.
"
997,IP,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
999,IP,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. The total net income reported is 18.7% below the total net income that those same 493 firms reported in the first quarter of 2007. (This is an improvement from the 22.9% drop they reported in the fourth quarter.) Specifically, those firms reported $170.8 billion in net income (before non-recurring items) this year and $210.2 billion last year.
"
1000,IP,"The Financials have been responsible for more than the entire drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 81.1% to $11.3 billion versus the $59.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $48.2 billion vs. a drop of just $39.4 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 5.9%. While still below the median growth number (which would be 11.43% if the Financials were excluded) it is much less than the yawning chasm at the full S&P numbers show. The actual picture is some what worse than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
1001,IP,"Let's put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season last year, the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Telecom sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. The sectors earnings only exceed the small Telecom, Materials, and Utility sectors, all of which in normal times provide less than 4% of total earnings each, and the Discretionary sector, which is both hurting itself, and which tends to be highly seasonal (most retailers are in the sector). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter, Financials were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink. Put another way, last year, the Financials gathered 28.5% of all the earnings in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, this year they were responsible for just 6.6%. Energy on the other hand was responsible for 21.0% of all first quarter earnings this year up from 13.6% a year ago.
"
1002,IP,"The biggest earnings gains in the first quarter were in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Tech holds the bronze with growth of 14.0%and is the only other sector to post double digit growth on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 37.9%). Health Care is up just 3.8%, a very significant slowdown from the 17.9% growth it showed in the fourth quarter.
"
1003,IP,"Turning to the expectations for the second quarter, it looks ugly, but not quite as ugly as in the first quarter. The total net income for the S&P 500 is currently expected to be 9.8% below the second quarter of 2007. This improvement over the 18.7% decline in the first quarter is almost entirely a function of things being just ugly and not downright disastrous in the Financial and Discretionary sectors, which are expected to be down 41.6% and 25.0%, respectively. Not exactly a cause for celebration to my way of thinking. This is particularly true since three months ago, the expectations were that total net income would decline by 5.1% in the first quarter for the S&P 500, due in large part to declines of 31.5% in the Discretionary sector and a 24.8% decline in the Financials.
"
1004,IP,"Meanwhile, all of the top five sectors in the first quarter are expected to see their growth rates drop by more than 5.0% (relative to the first quarter) in the second quarter. Energy is expected once again to lead the total net income growth race, but with only a 10.3% gain, down from 25.6% in the first quarter. Five sectors are expected to post lower total net income in the second quarter of 2008 than they did in the second quarter of 2007.

"
1006,IP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our ""revisions ratio"". This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1007,IP,"The revisions ratio dropped slightly after several weeks of improvement. It is now at 1.10, a reading that we generally consider neutral. With positive surprises running more than two to one over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. There has not been much movement in the ratio in recent weeks, with the ratio falling to 1.10 from 1.14 last week and 1.08 two weeks ago.
"
1008,IP,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is past the peak for this quarter. Over the last four weeks there have been 2,027 changes in estimates: 1,061 up and 966 down, down 39.1% from 3,326: 1,775 up and 1,551 down last week. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.98, slightly below the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Six sectors are in positive territory. The Materials sector was the weakest this week, finally displacing the Financials and the Discretionary sectors from the cellar. In Materials, paper was pummeled (International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Mead-Westvaco (MWV), and Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report)).
"
1009,IP,"The Energy sector again topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.53. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. Noteworthy for their strength were EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report). The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Sunoco (SUN) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
1010,IP,"Telecom was strong thanks to upward revisions at Century Telecom (CTL  -  Free Report) and Windstream (WIN  -  Free Report).

"
1012,IP,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. Although the revisions ratio is below one, it reversed course from an improving trend, falling to 0.90, up from 0.98 last week, and 0.95 two weeks ago. The strongest sector this week was Telecom at 2.55, followed by Energy at 2.05.
"
1013,IP,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.34, or almost three cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. Speaking of woods, they were responsible for the weakness in the Materials sector, with most of the weakness there traceable to forest products companies like WY and IP.
"
1014,IP,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also well past its seasonal peak. There were a total of 1,625 revisions: 772 up and 855 down. This is down 38.0% from 2,619 (1,296 up and 1,323 down) last week. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.84, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and almost into negative territory.

1016,IP,"Market Cap versus Total Earnings
"
1017,IP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1018,IP,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1019,IP,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 16.3% before rebounding to 20.3% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1020,IP,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 18.5% from 15.8% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.3% while Energy slips back to 16.6%. On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials 17.0% to 15.7%. Energy, despite being the biggest expected earner for 2008, is only in third place when it comes to index weight at 13.8%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction.
"
1021,IP,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. Just three months ago, the Financials were expected to gather 22.0% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. Over the same time, the market cap share for Financials has slipped from 17.17% to 15.72%, while Energys share has risen from 12.99% to its current 13.81%.
"
1022,IP,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.9x and based on 2009, only 10.1x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.5x, and 10.8x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 19.7x 2008 and 16.7x 2009 expectations.  Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
1023,IP,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.4x and 13.0x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.84% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 4.06% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 6.04% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
1026,IP,"With over 95% of the S&P 500 reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is effectively complete.  Over the next several weeks many of the remaining companies should report, a portion of which have been held up due to options related restatements.  Going in this season, median fourth-quarter growth was expected at around 10%.  Companies, however, were able to post nearly 13% instead, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Positive analyst surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly 3:1 and six out of 10 sectors were able to post double digit growth.  
"
1027,IP,"The Materials sector was the growth leader during the fourth quarter and remains head and shoulders above the Industrial sector, which posted the next highest year over year growth.  In Materials, as with many sectors, the current growth rate is expected to drop sharply in the first-quarter.  For Materials, growth in the first-quarter is expected to be less than half what it was in the fourth, but that is still higher than any other sector.  Large expected comparable decliners are Alcoa (AA), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), and Phelps Dodge (PD).  Note that these companies all reported triple-digit growth last quarter and only IP is expected to achieve that same feat in the first.
"
1028,IP,"Lagging firms during the fourth quarter were centered in the Utility and Telecom sectors.  The median utility has posted flat fourth-quarter comps and is expected to recover slightly in the first-quarter, to a 5.5% growth rate.  Telecom is the only sector in the red this quarter, with negative comps of over 10%.  Energy, which was the leader in the first three quarters of 2006 is showing only slight year-over-year growth, but then again it has some very difficult post-hurricane comparables.   
"
1029,IP,"Looking ahead, the S&P 500 is expected to post first-quarter median growth of 8.3%.  With a similar surprise ratio to that of the last couple of quarters, the growth could again make it into double digits.

"
1031,IP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.  For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1032,IP,"For fiscal 2007, the ratio has recently broken above equality, 1.0, and has stayed above this level for a third week now.  Over the last four weeks, there were 1,244 upward revisions and 1,135 downward, yielding a total revisions ratio of 1.10.  This is down slightly from last weeks 1.16.  For comparison, the third-quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.4 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.
"
1033,IP,"Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
1034,IP,"Given the collapse in oil prices earlier this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with over two cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.25.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.1, but excluding Energy it is at 1.19.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last month, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.  Three sectors currently enjoy more than twice as many upward revisions as estimate cuts: Industrials, Health Care and Consumer Staples.

1039,IP,"On a full-year1  basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 11.4% and 12.3%, respectively. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 14.7% in 2006 to 7.7% in 2007.  A rebound is then expected to 10.8% in 2008.  It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations.  Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
1040,IP,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.
"
1041,IP,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Below, we now give a glimpse of 2008 expectations. On a median basis, earnings growth is expected to be flat for Materials and improve significantly for Energy as both sectors enter 2008. On a total earnings basis, 2008 growth for these commodity based sectors is expected to be in the low single digits. On a median basis, Telecom is expected to show a slight drop in earnings growth for 2007, but a significant downturn in growth on a total earnings basis.  Mergers played a very significant role in the high total earnings growth for the sector in 2006.  Consumer Discretionary is expected to have the highest acceleration in 2008 on a total earnings basis.  Tech is expected to be the fastest grower in 2008 on both a median and total earnings basis.

1043,IP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1044,IP,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1045,IP,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.1%. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.5% of the total expected earnings for 2007.
"
1046,IP,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.5% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 9.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 12.5% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market.

Operating earnings also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.GAAP earnings for the quarter were $729 million or $1.74 per share compared with $209 million or 50 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Net sales improved to $5,621 million in the reported quarter from $5,132 million in the year-ago quarter, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,430 million.Total business segment operating profit in the reported quarter was $512 million compared with $414 million in first-quarter 2017. The significant year-over-year increase in operating profit was largely attributable to higher revenues. International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | International Paper Company QuoteSegment PerformanceIndustrial Packaging: Sales from this segment increased to $3,827 million from $3,577 million in the year-ago period. Operating profit improved to $437 million from $384 million in the year-ago quarter. The improved performance was mostly driven by record box shipments, higher average sales prices and volumes in North America.Printing Papers: Sales from this segment were $1,053 million in the reported quarter compared with $995 million in the year-earlier quarter. Operating profit for the segment was $64 million compared with $100 million in the year-ago quarter, due to higher planned maintenance outage costs, higher input costs and lower sales volumes.Global Cellulose Fibers: Sales from this segment were $677 million compared with $564 million in the prior-year quarter due to higher fluff pulp sales volume as global demand remained strong. Operating profit was $11 million against operating loss of $70 million a year ago, largely driven by higher average sales prices, record volume and strong synergy realization.Discontinued OperationsDiscontinued operations of the North American Consumer Packaging business resulted in an income of $368 million or 88 cents per share in the first quarter compared with income of $17 million or 4 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash and temporary investments aggregated $1,141 million compared with $998 million in the year-ago period while long-term debt was $10,759 million at quarter end.Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $663 million compared with $633 million in the prior-year period.

1050,IP,"Nearly 90% of the S&P 500 has reported fourth-quarter numbers and the results remain bullish.  Since there are more than a handful of firms that will report late due to options related restatements, we are very close to the end of the reporting season.  Median growth going in was expected at around 10%, but companies have been able to post nearly 13% instead, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Positive analyst surprises continue to outnumber negatives by over 3:1 and six out of 10 sectors are showing double-digit growth.  
"
1051,IP,"The Materials sector has the growth lead this quarter and is head and shoulders above Healthcare, the sector with the next highest year over year growth.  In Materials, as with many sectors, the current growth rate is expected to drop sharply in the first-quarter.  For Materials, growth in the first quarter is expected to be less than half what it was in the fourth, but that is still higher than any other sector.  Large expected comparable decliners are Alcoa (AA), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), and Phelps Dodge (PD).  Note that these companies all reported triple-digit growth last quarter and only IP is expected to achieve that same feat in the first.
"
1052,IP,"Lagging firms this quarter are centered in the Utility and Telecom sectors.  The median utility has posted flat fourth-quarter comps and is expected to recover slightly in the first quarter, to a 4% growth rate.  Telecom is the only sector in the red this quarter, with negative comps of just over 3%.  Energy, which was the leader in the first three quarters of 2006 is showing only barely positive year over year growth, but then again it has some very difficult comparisons it is working against.   
"
1053,IP,"Overall, the S&P 500 is expected to post first-quarter median growth of 8.2%.  With a similar surprise ratio to that of the last couple of quarters, the growth could again make it into double-digits.

"
1055,IP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.  For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1056,IP,"For fiscal 2007, the ratio has finally broken above equality and has stayed above the 1.0 level for a second week now.  Over the last four weeks, there were 1,679 upward revisions and 1,446 downward, yielding a total revisions ratio of 1.16.  This is a slight improvement from last week when the ratio stood at 1.04.  For comparison however, the third quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.5 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.
"
1057,IP,"Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
1058,IP,"Given the collapse in oil prices so far this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with over three cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.35.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.04, but excluding Energy it is at 1.16.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last three weeks, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.  Four sectors currently enjoying more than twice as many upward revisions as estimate cuts.  Interestingly they include both Cyclical sectors (Materials and Industrials) and defensive sectors (Health Care and Staples).

"
1063,IP,"On a full-year1 basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 11.8% and 12.3%, respectively, actually a slight acceleration from the 11.7% expected/posted for 2006. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 15.0% in 2006 to 7.9% in 2007.  A rebound is then expected to 10.6% in 2008.  It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations.  Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
1064,IP,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.
"
1065,IP,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Below, we now give a glimpse of 2008 expectations. On a median basis, earnings growth is expected to slow for Materials and improve slightly for Energy as both sectors enter 2008. On a total earnings basis, 2008 growth for these commodity based sectors is expected to be in the low single digits. On a median basis, Telecom is expected to have a slight acceleration in earnings growth for 2007, but a significant deceleration on a total earnings basis.  Mergers played a very significant role in the high total earnings growth for the sector in 2006.  Consumer Discretionary is expected to have the highest acceleration in 2008 on a total earnings basis.  Tech is expected to be the fastest grower in 2008 on both a median and total earnings basis.

Positive surprises outnumber negatives by nearly 5:1 and the median surprise is 4.7%. Sector surprise leaders include Monsanto (MON) and International Paper (IP  -  Free Report). As we expected, the median growth rate for the Energy sector fell dramatically from the levels shown last week. In the sector, the higher growth oil service firms reported early. As the E&P and Integrated firms, which face extremely tough year-over-year comparisons, reported, the median growth rate plunged from over 20% to less than 3%. 
"
1075,IP,"By every measure, the Utilities sector is the laggard this quarter. It is the only sector showing negative year-over-year growth. At around 40% reported, the sectors median quarter over quarter growth rate thus far is negative 1% and the surprise ratio is 1:1. Tech is another slow grower but has been much better than expected thus far, with a median EPS surprise of over 7%. Overall, only three sectors have failed to post double-digit fourth quarter growth and every sector but one boasts a median EPS surprise of over 1%.

1085,IP,"On a full-year  basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 12.1% and 12.3%, respectively, actually a slight acceleration from the 11.5% expected for 2006. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 14.8% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2007 and 10.1% in 2008. It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations. Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
1086,IP,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.
"
1087,IP,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Below, we now give a glimpse of 2008 expectations. On a median basis, earnings growth is expected to continue to slow for the Energy and Materials sectors both in the current year and in 2008. On a total earnings basis, growth is expected to be flat in 2008 for these commodity based sectors. On a median basis, Telecom is expected to have the greatest acceleration in earnings growth for 2007, but a significant deceleration on a total earnings basis. Mergers played a very significant role in the high total earnings growth for the sector in 2006. Consumer Discretionary is expected to have the highest acceleration on a total earnings basis. Tech is expected to be the fastest grower in 2008 on both a median and total earnings basis.

1089,IP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1090,IP,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown).

On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1091,IP,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.7%. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.8% of the total expected earnings for 2007.
"
1092,IP,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.6% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 9.5% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 12.4% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market.

"
1096,IP,"The reports will break what otherwise is a seasonal lull for earnings. Fourth-quarter earnings warnings season will not start for a few more weeks and there are only a limited amount earnings reports coming out right now. Therefore, it is not surprising to see the number of estimate revisions drop. Using a four-week rolling period, there were only 1,728 revisions of as last Friday for S&P 500 companies, a significant drop from even a week ago. 
"
1097,IP,"The drop in the number of revisions comes at a time when the economic data has not been bullish. Yet, despite concerns about a hard landing for the economy, the outlook for growth remains strong. Analysts project the median S&P 500 company to generate 10.5% growth in the fourth quarter and 12.8% growth next year. Zacks Equity Research anticipates that the current economic headwinds will slow, allowing the economy to continue its expansion next year. This, coupled with cost-cutting and share buybacks, should allow corporations to continue to achieve profit growth throughout next year.

1100,IP,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,728. This is down from the peak of 4-week revisions we recorded last week: 2,568. In the coming weeks, we should continue to see the total number of revisions fall off.

On the upside of the revisions story, Health Care remains at the front of the pack with an impressive ratio of 2.79. Big pharma continues to show strength.

1104,IP,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio has continued its uptrend and remains above 1.0, at 1.18. This is extraordinarily important. With the economy slowing, housing in a free fall and the yield curve inverted, one can easily make an intellectually coherent case for a recession next year. However, there has never been a recession where earnings grow at anything close to a double-digit rate. This is the elephant in the room that must be explained by any recession predictor. There is no way that the expected growth rate will come down unless estimate cuts exceed estimate increases.
"
1105,IP,"The bright point regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Financial Services. The sectors ratio has reached 1.83.

On the downside, Utilities remains the 2007 revisions ratio laggard with a 0.51.

1107,IP,"On a full-year1 basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.6% and 12.8%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable (slight upward drift for 2006) over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 14.4% versus 9.8% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 9.8% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession. Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 above 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
1108,IP,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates.

The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Countering this is the expensing of options this year. As recently as last year companies were allowed to use bogus intrinsic value accounting for stock options. In other words pretend that there was no cost to the company for making its executives extraordinarily rich in many cases. Now they have to realize that compensation is indeed an expense, which holds down reported earnings growth, even if there is no change in the economic earnings. Unlike some other earnings databases, our estimates fully include the effect of expensing options (which would explain why our numbers are somewhat lower than theirs).
"
1109,IP,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing nearly 39% this year and approximately 18% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors    Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)    account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Industrial sectors combined.

Materials - Timber is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 3, placing it in top 19%.Index DetailsThe fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $232.80 M, making it the largest ETF attempting to match the performance of the Materials - Timber segment of the U.S. equity market. CUT seeks to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI IMI Timber Select Capped Index before fees and expenses.The MSCI ACWI IMI Timber Select Capped Index reflects the performance of those stocks in the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Indexes that are engaged in the ownership and management of forests and timberlands and production of finished products which use timber as raw material.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.55%, making it the most expensive product in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.53%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

1124,IP," Paper and packaging firm, International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial results before the opening bell on Apr 26. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the quarter across most of the operating segments due to healthy growth dynamics. However, total corporate revenues in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to decline to $5,430 million from $5,511 million generated in first-quarter 2017.      Whether such a juxtaposition could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Factors to ConsiderInternational Paper is continuing with its restructuring initiatives to transform itself into a core packaging company. The company is investing considerably to improve its North American containerboard mill system, enhance product quality, and reduce manufacturing and delivery costs. At the same time, International Paper is divesting its non-core businesses to focus more on high-return capital projects in its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth.  Mergers and acquisitions also remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its scale of operations in the long term. In North America, the company envisions a large opportunity within its Industrial Packaging business, which continues to generate the best margins in the industry. It is further taking initiatives to drive margin expansion across the business through inorganic growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Industrial Packaging segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, is currently pegged at $3,759 million, up from $3,499 million generated in first-quarter 2017. Revenues from Printing Papers segment are expected to be $1,025 million compared with $995 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Industrial Packaging segment’s operating profit for the quarter is expected to improve to $455 million from $365 million recorded in the year-ago quarter, while the same for Printing Papers segment is likely to decrease to $83 million from $100 million.Other Key FactorsInternational Paper has huge pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting its earnings growth potential. Rising energy, chemical and old corrugated containers’ costs remain headwinds, particularly in harsh winter conditions.Our proven model does not conclusively show that International Paper is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:   Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.34%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  International Paper Company Price and EPS Surprise International Paper Company Price and EPS Surprise | International Paper Company QuoteZacks Rank: International Paper has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to make us confident about an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1126,IP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, International Paper has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, International Paper’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15.6 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that International Paper has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for International Paper stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, International Paper has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, International Paper currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes International Paper a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for International Paper is just 1.2, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.6, which is better than the industry average of 8.0. Clearly, IP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though International Paper might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives IP a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 2.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:International Paper Company Price and Consensus  International Paper Company Price and Consensus | International Paper Company QuoteFurther, the company with long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5% sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineInternational Paper is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 17% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company. Further, over the past two years, the industry has surpassed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1130,IP,"Investors must be constantly aware of sector strength, as that is the closes tie that stocks have with the economy. There are, however, other factors to take into consideration when considering the types of stocks you want in your portfolio. One such factor, capitalization, is an axis along which investors should be sure to diversify. Investors should also use relative performance of companies with differing market capitalization to guide the timing of new purchases. Discover what capitalization stocks that relative performance points to right now and one other factor that you should be aware of in the earnings report of the companies you own.Picking Market Caps
"
1131,IP,"Many times in this space I have cited Experts who insist that stock-picking, and not index investing is the best way to make money in this market. Those same experts stressed broad diversification, but argue that simply buying index funds is not the way to accomplish it. Richard Moroney, editor of  Dow Theory Forecasts warns that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is only 30 companies and the S&P 500 is dominated by just 50 stocks, or 10% of that average. Moroney thinks investors can outperform those two indices without much additional riskby diversifying broadly and looking for attractive stocks in all corners of the markets. 
"
1132,IP,"Moroney notes that the S&P 500 is a decent proxy for the total value of the US stock market. However, the S&P 500s and the Dows inability to close above the levels of 1157,76 and 10737.7 is partly evidence of their domination by large cap stocks. Both averages are within 8% of their highs, but it would take significant outperformance by the largest stocks to drive those indices higher.
"
1133,IP,"According to Moroney, the 25 companies in the S&P 500 with the largest market capitalization have delivered an average YTD total return of 1.8% through October 12th, versus 5% for all stocks in the index. For stocks in the S&P 1500, which includes the S&P 500, MidCap 400 and SmallCap 600 indices, the YTD return is 5.7%. The 50 largest stocks, among those 1500, trade at 19x forward earnings, in line with all stocks in the index. 
"
1134,IP,"Moroney does concede that a number of factors may be holding large cap stocks back including a median growth average of just 14.1% vs. 19.4% among the S&P 1500. Second, the 50 largest stocks are concentrated in pharmaceuticals and technology and will have a difficult time producing double digit earnings growth. Moroney thinks that in spite of those strikes against them, the largest cap stocks merit attention.Something about Charges
"
1135,IP,"Sometimes the bottom line is not the bottom line. Richard Moroney notes that nonrecurring charges are excluded from companies quarterly earnings statements. While corporate boards exclude those charges because they do not feel the charges present an adequate picture of their companies earnings, Moroney notes that charges may offer advance warning of poor share-price performance.
"
1136,IP,"In a back-test of more than 14 years of charges serial chargers tend to underperform companies who do not take chargeIn the 165 rolling 12-month periods between January 1990 and August 2004, the median top-quintile stock of the S&P 1500 outperformed more than three-fourths of the time. Average outperformance was more than 4%. Companies with no or few special charges tended to outperform and three and six-month holding periods, though the relationship was stronger among 12-month periods.
"
1137,IP,"The items most commonly listed as special charges include merger and restructuring costs, losses from natural disasters, past earnings from businesses or properties sold, or write-offs of assets declining in value.Clean & Less Than Clean Earnings
"
1138,IP,"Moroney feels the following stocks have solid track records of clean earnings.Dell ( NASDAQ: DELL ) has gained share in the personal-computer market every year since 1995 and is the worlds leading seller of PCs, with an 18% share. Over the last five years, sales have grown at an annualized rate of 23% and earnings have increased at a 20% clip. While the pricing environment for computer hardware remains aggressive, demand for PCs has improved. And Dells competitive advantages leave it better-positioned than most peers to survive a price war. The company is expanding internationally and moving into new markets, such as consumer electronics and printers. Dell says it has garnered a 10% share of the U.S. ink-jet printer market since it entered the business a year ago. Dell generates strong free cash flow  nearly $3 billion in the last four quarters. The company boasts a healthy balance sheet, with $5.5 billion in cash and investments and long-term debt equal to just 7.4% of total capital. The stock

More employers are self-insuring because the cost of primary workers- compensation insurance continues to rise, and Delphis policies protect such employers from catastrophic claims. Delphi expects this trend to continue and demand in this segment to remain strong. Excess workers-compensation insurance premiums jumped 32% in the June quarter, helped by a 12% average price increase on products sold in the first six months of 2004. The disability-insurance market is improving, and disability premiums at Delphi rose 22% in the June quarter.

1163,IP,"International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) was spurned yet again when its sweetened bid to take over Ireland-based Smurfit Kappa was rejected by the European rival. This is the second unsolicited offer within a month by International Paper, indicating its urgency to expand operations beyond North America to capitalize on increasing demand for packaging materials for online shopping.The latest proposal included a cash-and-stock offer of €25.25 in cash (up from the previous offer of €22) along with 0.3 new shares of International Paper for each share of Smurfit. However, Smurfit management summarily rejected the bid citing gross undervaluation.On the other hand, International Paper believed that the proposed transaction would have created annual synergies worth at least $450 million. The company reportedly accounts for one in three cardboard boxes manufactured in the United States and the acquisition of Smurfit would have made it a leader in Europe. The combined entity would have gained an unrivalled competitive advantage, benefiting from the rise in demand for packaging materials from the e-commerce industry.Smurfit has operations in 35 countries across Europe. The company believes that its exposure in varied European markets makes it an enviable candidate for acquisition by other companies if its deal with International Paper fails to materialize.Mergers and acquisitions remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its long-term business proposition. In North America, the company envisions a large opportunity within its industrial packaging business, which continues to generate the best margins in the industry. It is further taking initiatives to drive margin expansion across the business through inorganic growth.At the same time, International Paper is divesting its non-core businesses to focus more resources on high-return capital projects in its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth. The company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the markets in China and Asia more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and through exports from the United States and other parts of the world.However, International Paper has underperformed the industry in the last three months with an average decline of 9.5% against 1.8% gain for the latter. The company has huge pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting the positives from its acquisition spree, a primary growth driver. Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Fibria Celulose S.A.

Despite its strong price appreciation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock still appears to have enough room for further upside. The stock currently has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.3%.Growth Drivers The company has outperformed the Zacks categorized Paper and Related Products industry with an average return of 15.2% compared with a 10.6% gain for the latter, over the last 90 days. International Paper is undergoing restructuring initiatives to transform itself into a core packaging company. It intends to invest $300 million through 2017 to further improve its North American containerboard mill system, enhance product quality, and reduce manufacturing and delivery costs. These projects are expected to have a collective internal rate of return of 20%. Moving forward, International Paper intends to focus more resources on high-return capital projects within its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth.On Jun 29, the company inked a definitive agreement to divest its foodservice business in China. Over the past couple of years, the company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the Chinese and Asian markets more effectively by supplying globally competitive products, primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and exports from the U.S. and other parts of the world.Last year, International Paper sold its corrugated packaging business in China and Southeast Asia to Xiamen Bridge Hexing Equity Investment Partnership Enterprise, which specializes in packaging and related industries, for approximately RMB 1 billion ($150 million). These included 18 manufacturing plants involving employee strength of about 3,000.Mergers and acquisitions remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its long-term business proposition. In North America, the company envisions a large opportunity within its industrial packaging businesses, that generate the best margins in the industry. It is taking initiatives to drive further margin expansion over time across the business. International Paper has completed the acquisition of leading timberland owner Weyerhaeuser Co.’s pulp business for $2.2 billion in cash. With a combined capacity of nearly 1.9 million metric tons of pulp, the transaction is likely to strengthen International Paper’s position in the global fluff pulp market and augment its operating cash flow. In addition, the company expects the acquisition to generate annual synergies of approximately $175 million by the end of 2018. It also expects the deal to offer the company higher flexibility to manage a wide portfolio of products to meet customer needs through superior R&D capabilities and priceless patent portfolio.Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Fibria Celulose S.A.

1165,IP,"Last night I read an article that polled the most renowned music experts on the greatest music albums of all time. The list of the top 5 includes Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Revolver by the Beatles, Highway 61 Revisited by Bob Dylan, and Marvin Gaye's Whats Going On. (I have to admit, the Beach Boys actually made the experts' top 5, but this is my article and I'm vetoing them. They're OK, but a top 5 album?) Looking at the list, I would have to say that although they aren't my personal top 5, these are some pretty damn good albums.  
"
1166,IP,"So on my train ride into work this morning, I thought about those music experts and their strong consensus picks and wondered if expert stock analysts could provide insights or other information that would lead to strong, profitable stock picks. On first thought, you'd think since all this analyst information is highly public, that it's already priced into the stocks and you cant profit from it. But, herein lies a market anomaly. Let's take a closer look.  
"
1167,IP,"Stock analysts provide many different types of data on companies from buy/hold/sell recommendations to earnings estimates to projected growth rates. I tested all this information to see if you can beat the market with it.  
"
1168,IP,"Beginning with a universe of the largest 3000 stocks, I ran tests from January 2000 until June 2011 by building portfolios based on each of these analyst metrics. The average annualized return and standard deviation are below: 
"
1169,IP,"The above results show that four of these measures outperformed the selection universe and three underperformed. It's interesting to note that the analyst ratings in and of themselves didn't perform better than the selection universe, but the change in analyst ratings did extremely well.  So don't just buy a ""Strong Buy"" because it's a ""Strong Buy.""  It's better to buy a ""Strong Buy"" that moved from something else (like a ""Sell"" or ""Hold"") to a ""Strong Buy."" 
"
1170,IP,"These results also indicate that a company with a high 3-5 year projected growth rate is something that should be shunned like the plague. As you can see, high expected growth usually ends badly.  Excluding those companies with expected growth rates above 20%, the returns improve dramatically (10.8% versus -3.5%). Remember this the next time you hear someone hawking a stock with projected growth rates above 20%!  
"
1171,IP,"Based on the performance figures above, here's a method for finding stocks to take advantage of the Analyst Anomaly: First, create a liquid, investible set of the stocks with the largest 3000 market values and average daily trading volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if there's not enough liquidity, it'll be hard for you to trade). Next, due to the uncertainty regarding some foreign issues, keep only U.S. common stocks.Add another filter by selecting the top 100 stocks with the highest percentage change in the average rating over the last four weeks. (You want improved consensus ratings.)Then select only those top 50 stocks with the highest net revision (up minus down) over the last four weeks. (You want to maximize the number of upgrades and minimize the number of downgrades.)Of these 50, pick 25 with the largest percentage increase in the last four weeks of the current quarter's earnings estimate. (Improving quarterly earnings estimates is good.)Finally, select the top 10 stocks with the highest percentage increase of the last four weeks in the current quarter's earnings estimate. (Improving annual earnings estimates is good too.)
"
1172,IP,"Here are 5 great stocks based on analyst data (09/15/11):  
"
1173,IP,"(COF  -  Free Report)  Capital One Financial Corp. 
"
1174,IP,"Capital One is a bank holding company that gathers deposits and makes loans. Over the last month, analysts have upgraded the stock to Outperform and increased both their quarterly and annual earnings estimates.

"
1185,IP,"On Mar 6, we issued an updated research report on paper and packaging firm, International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report).Growth Drivers International Paper is undergoing continued restructuring initiatives to transform itself into a core packaging company. The company intends to invest considerably to improve its North American containerboard mill system, enhance product quality and reduce manufacturing and delivery costs. These projects are expected to have a collective internal rate of return of 20%.Mergers and acquisitions remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its long-term business proposition. In North America, the company envisions a large opportunity within its industrial packaging business, which continues to generate the best margins in the industry. It is further taking initiatives to drive margin expansion across the business through inorganic growth.At the same time, International Paper is divesting its non-core businesses to focus more resources on high-return capital projects in its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth. The company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the markets in China and Asia more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and through exports from the United States and other parts of the world.International Paper has also completed the divesture of its consumer packaging business in North America. The assets were sold to Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPK  -  Free Report), a leading provider of paper-based packaging solutions for food, beverage and other consumer product companies. The divested asset portfolio included two manufacturing plants and four converting facilities with employee strength of roughly 3,900.Graphic Packaging will own 79.5% of the combined company while International Paper will have ownership of the remainder. The transaction will help Graphic Packaging extend its business in the foodservice and folding carton markets. Also, the divesture helped International Paper to focus on its core businesses and strengthen its balance sheet as Graphic Packaging assumed $660 million of its debt.Headwinds With continued portfolio restructuring activities, the paper and packaging products manufacturer aims to improve its long-term profitability as it faces stiff competition from diverse players across the industry.The company depends heavily on raw materials such as wood fiber, purchased in the form of pulpwood, wood chips and old corrugated containers (OCC), certain chemicals like caustic soda and starch, and energy sources like natural gas, coal and fuel oil. Rising energy, chemical and OCC costs remain headwinds, particularly in harsh winter conditions. This is likely to affect its profitability to some extent.In addition, International Paper has huge pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting the positives from its acquisition spree, a primary growth driver.International Paper has underperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 3.7% compared with 8.6% gain for the latter.Zacks Rank & Key Picks Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report) and Veritiv Corporation (VRTV  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"
1197,IP,"•    Bottom Up estimates: $63.42 for 2009, $78.16 for 2010
"
1198,IP,"•    Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $73.45 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information. This is very much of a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
1199,IP,"The third quarter was a fantastic earnings season. With all of the reports in, there have been 379 which have exceeded expectations while only 72 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.26. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over deliver, this quarter the beats beat the misses by close to twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
1200,IP,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.07%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.  Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 226 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth, versus 271 which have fallen short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.83.
"
1201,IP,"On the top line it was also a successful reporting season relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues were 10.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 276 firms reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 195 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.42. On the other hand, only 149 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 349 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.43.
"
1202,IP,"Put another way, only 29.8% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago. However, on a sequential basis revenues did rise by 2.9%. Looking forward, in the fourth quarter revenues are expected to be up by 2.9% sequentially and by 1.9% year over year. In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
1203,IP,"The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.
"
1204,IP,"The strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with four sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.12, which while slightly lower than a few weeks ago, is still very high and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point.
"
1205,IP,"The better than expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 1.92 for next year. While the total number of revisions is coming down (seasonally normal) the ratio is still quite bullish.
"
1206,IP,"Now it is time to turn our focus to the fourth quarter. Saying that the market as a whole faces easy year-over-year comps is a bit like Noah remarking that it looks like rain -- a huge understatement. Total earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to be more than double year-ago levels, up 116.4%. This is mostly due to very easy comparisons after last year’s disaster.
"
1207,IP,"However, the growth is very much concentrated in a few sectors, most notably the Financials, but with a nice assist from Autos and Construction (although those sectors are far smaller). Consumer Staples also are expected to show extremely high growth largely due to massive year-ago losses at News Corp (NWSA), on what is arguably a non-recurring item (the data is adjusted to remove non-recurring items, but it looks like we slipped on that one).
"
1208,IP,"Because of the year-over-year distortion from the debacle that was last year’s fourth quarter, it is more instructive to look at the sequential growth (although keep in mind that some sectors, most notably Retail, are highly seasonal). There the picture is far more subdued, with total earnings in the fourth quarter actually expected to be 4.6% below third quarter levels. Although if we see even a normal amount of positive surprises, the level is probably going to be more like flat sequentially.
"
1209,IP,"Aerospace is expected to be the sequential leader, but keep in mind that this sector was awful on a sequential basis in the 3Q, so that is not real strong evidence of a big underlying growth trend there. In all, 9 of the 16 sectors are expected to post lower total earnings in the 4Q than in the 3Q.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

1217,IP,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
1218,IP,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Industrial Products -28.91% 100.00% 13.92 20 1 9 12Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Construction 76.05% 100.00% 11.85 6 4 5 6Busines Service 9.12% 100.00% 11.11 8 0 3 6Consumer Staples 2.40% 100.00% 10.53 40 4 31 13Computer and Tech -9.95% 100.00% 7.69 57 8 34 48Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Basica Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.73 14 4 4 16Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.63 27 8 23 14Medical 3.62% 100.00% 5.63 36 1 34 9Retail/Wholesale 2.18% 100.00% 5.41 38 5 26 20Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Oils and Energy -62.90% 100.00% 4.84 29 10 2 39Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Auto 183.55% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4S&P -10.70% 100.00% 7.07 379 72 226 271Sales Surprises

"
1259,IP,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Transportation, Retailers and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
1260,IP,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples and Medical sectors have very high revisions ratio of 8.25 and 4.41, respectively, so it’s not just the cyclicals.

1281,IP,"Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPK  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that one of its completely-owned subsidiaries, Graphic Packaging International, LLC, has signed an agreement to acquire PFP, LLC along with PFP Dallas Converting, LLC. Financial consideration of the buyout has not been disclosed.PFP — an independent converter — primarily engages in manufacturing air-filter frames (mainly paperboard-based). It operates two manufacturing facilities; one in Lancaster, TX and the other in Lebanon, TN. PFP was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Tennessee. Details of BuyoutAs noted, in the last 12 months, PFP’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization margin was solid. Moreover, its paperboard, mainly coated unbleached kraft paperboard (CUK), conversion totaled roughly 18 thousand tons.Addition of PFP to the portfolio will drive Graphic Packaging Holding’s air-filter frame (paperboard-based) business. It will result in cost synergies and boost the company’s CUK paperboard tons.This buyout will be integrated with Graphic Packaging Holding’s Americas Paperboard Packaging segment. In the first quarter of 2018, the company generated roughly 67.1% of its net sales from this segment. In the quarter, the segment’s sales grew 24.9% on a year-over-year basis. Graphic Packaging Holding’s Inorganic InitiativesThe above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Graphic Packaging Holding’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to improve its product lines and market exposure. It’s worth mentioning here that the company started its air-filter frame (paperboard-based) business with the acquisition of Carton Craft Corporation and its related company Lithocraft, Inc in July 2017.In addition to the above-mentioned buyouts, Graphic Packaging Holding combined its business with North America Consumer Packaging business of International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) in January 2018. In December 2017, the company acquired folding-carton producer, Seydaco Packaging Corp. as well as its related companies; National Carton and Coating Co., and Groupe Ecco Boites Pliantes Ltée. Also, in October 2017, the company acquired Norgraft Packaging, S.A., a folding carton manufacturer.

1282,IP,"The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16, which has historically been promising for the U.S. stock market. Astute investors, thus, should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage. And why not? The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year. Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates, on the other hand, are unwarranted and likely to ease.Year of the Dog is Great for the U.S. Stock MarketThe U.S. equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog, per LPL Research. Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12-month return on the broader S&P 500 in the year was up more than 15% on average.In four of the last five Year of the Dog, the market clocked double-digit gains. In 1958, returns were the highest, up 32.9%. In the most recent one ending in 2006, the returns were also quite solid, increasing 12.4%. YearS&P 500 Return in the Year of the Dog195832.9%197012.7%198220.7%1994-2.3%200612.4%Average15.3%(Source: LPL)Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that “in fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return.” In the past Year of the Goat, Tiger, Ox, Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Dragon, Horse, Rat, Rooster and Snake, the S&P 500 had given an average return of 14.9%, 13.8%, 13.5%, 10.6%, 10.5%, 9.2%, 8.7%, 6.3%, 3.2%, 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars, but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note. The S&P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16. After all, U.S. earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus, while inflation scares are overblown.Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration’s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings, in a market that already has historically high valuations. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35% to 21%. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy. Most of the S&P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations, while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive. For the 398 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% surpassing revenue estimates.In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.8% higher revenues (read more: What Will Retail Earnings Show?).Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.But, market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out. Even though the consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, it stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012.  Wage growth in January also doesn’t hint at a surge in cost of living. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if managers and supervisors’ salaries are excluded, hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace. This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness, investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious.

1284,IP,"International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) has decided to cancel its proposal for the takeover of the Irish packaging company — Smurfit Kappa — due to lack of engagement from the latter’s management.Memphis-based International Paper was given time until Jun 6 to make a binding offer for the buyout by the Irish Takeover Panel. The company confirmed that it has dropped its pursuit to acquire its Ireland-based rival.It is worth noting that International Paper had made two takeover proposals in February and March, but both were rebuffed by Smurfit Kappa’s management, citing gross undervaluation. International Paper first valued Smurfit Kappa at €36.46 per share and the second at €37.54 per share or €8.9 billion.  Also, in May, International Paper decided not to put across a hostile bid to acquire Smurfit Kappa and stressed the importance of proceeding on an agreed basis. It suggested that the two entities should meet to discuss the potential of the combined firm.Per Ireland's rules, International Paper will be barred from making fresh attempts to acquire Smurfit Kappa for the next 12 months.Nevertheless, International Paper remains focused on executing its operational strategy, which will boost shareholders’ value in the future.The company continues to restructure itself to transform into a core packaging company. M&As remain a key strategy to strengthen its long-term business proposition.It is taking initiatives to improve its operating margins over time across the business. The stock has outperformed the industry with an average return of 4% against a decline of 0.2% for the latter in the past three months.International Paper currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1286,IP,"The first quarter earnings season is all but over with 487 firms in the S&P 500 having reported. Six sectors have all their reports in and two more are more than 95% done.
"
1287,IP,"We can draw a couple of conclusions about the results. First is that there is a serious dichotomy between growth as measured by the median EPS growth rate and as measured by the total net income growth. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago.
"
1288,IP,"More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
1289,IP,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year-over-year EPS growth rate is 9.0%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While that is short of the sort of double digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the firms yet to report is for 5.6% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 3.03%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
1290,IP,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.3:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. The Financials have been responsible for 32.1% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 18.9% of the total firms reporting.
"
1291,IP,"On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.43) and Industrials (5.50). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.00, has the second highest median surprise, at 7.23%. Telecom has the best median surprise at 8.00%, even though its surprise ratio is just 1.67. However, given the very small number of firms in the Telecom sector (nine), medians of any sort are less meaningful than sectors with large numbers of firms in them.
"
1292,IP,"In terms of year over year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the firms reporting year over year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 22.2% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 17.4%. Honorable (double digit) mentions go to Telecom, Health Care and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
1293,IP,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE) and Wal-Mart (WMT) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW) and Big Lots (BIG). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
1295,IP,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. Total net income reported is 18.5% below the total net income that those same 487 firms earned a year prior. (It is, however, an improvement from the -23.0% they reported in the fourth quarter.) Specifically, those firms reported $169.8 billion in net income (before non-recurring items) this year and $208.2 billion last year.
"
1296,IP,"The Financials have been responsible for more than all the drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 81.1% to $11.3 billion versus the $59.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $48.2 billion vs. a drop of just $38.5 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 6.5%. While still below the median growth number (which would be 11.43% if the Financials were excluded) it is much less than the yawning chasm at the full S&P numbers show. The actual picture is some what wore than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
1297,IP,"Lets put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season last year, the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Telecom sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. Its earnings only exceed the small Telecom, Materials, and Utility sectors, all of which in normal times provide less than 4% of total earnings each, and the Discretionary sector, which is both hurting itself, and which tends to be highly seasonal (most retailers are in the sector). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter Financials were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink.
"
1298,IP,"Last year, the Financials gathered 28.5% of all the earnings in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, this year they were responsible for just 6.6%. Energy on the other hand was responsible for 21.0% of all first quarter earnings this year up from 13.6% a year ago.
"
1299,IP,"The biggest earnings gains so far have been in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Both have all the reports in so those numbers are now fixed. Tech holds the bronze with growth of 14.0%and is the only other sector to post double digit growth on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 34.5%).
"
1300,IP,"Health Care is up just 3.8%, a very significant slowdown from the 17.9% growth it showed in the fourth quarter. Much of that slowdown can be traced to lower earnings at Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), which in the first quarter of last year was responsible for 19.9% of all earnings in the sector. Weak results from Health Insurance firms like United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) and Wellpoint (WLP) did not help the sectors cause this quarter either.

"
1302,IP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1303,IP,"The revisions ratio is continuing to trend up. It is now at 1.14, a reading that we generally consider neutral, but the trend is encouraging. With positive surprises running more than two to one over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 1.14 from 1.08 last week and 1.02 two weeks ago. It does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far.
"
1304,IP,"Over the last four weeks there have been 3,326 changes in estimates: 1,775 up and 1,551 down, down 10.9% from 3,733: 1,935 up and 1,798 down last week. We are now past the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter.  The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.95, slightly below the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Seven sectors are in positive territory.  The Financials and The Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to be the weakest, as they have for many months now. However, even there, the ratios have more than doubled off their lows.
"
1305,IP,"Within some of the sectors where the overall revisions ratio is not that dramatic there were some interesting industry trends. In Materials, paper was pummeled (International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Mead-Westvaco (MWV), and Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report) all suffered lots of cuts) while Gas was good (Praxair (PX  -  Free Report) and Air Products (APD) had lots of increases).
"
1306,IP,"The Energy sector again topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.22. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Chesapeake (CHK) and EOG Resources (EOG) were noteworthy for their strength. The Coal firms Peabody (BTU) and Consol Energy (CNX) were also strong. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
1307,IP,"The Industrials had the next best revisions ratio this week at 2.07. The strength was mostly due to the Aerospace (General Dynamics (GD) and Lockheed (LMT  -  Free Report) stand out).  That strength was offset by weakness among the Air Freight firms, Fedex (FDX) and UPS (UPS  -  Free Report).
"
1308,IP,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts. While the cuts were widespread, there were three insurance firms that stood out by bucking the trend. Aflac (AFL), ACE (ACE) and Chubb (CB) all had more than ten estimates raised.

1310,IP,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. Although the revisions ratio is below one, it is improving at 0.98, up from 0.95 last week, and 0.88 two weeks ago. The most strength comes from the Energy and Industrial sectors, both with more than two increases for each cut.  The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008. One Energy firm that was noteworthy in its weakness (for both years) was BJ Services (BJS) which suffered a large earnings shortfall in the first quarter.
"
1311,IP,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.32, or over three cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While the weakness was widespread, the end of the alphabet seemed to be taking it hardest with numerous cuts for Wachovia (WB) Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Washington Mutual (WM), XL Capital (XL) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report).
"
1312,IP,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also nearing its seasonal peak. There were a total of 2,619 revisions: 1,296 up and 1,323 down. This is down 11.1% from 2,947 (1,437 up and 1,510 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, we are past the peak for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.80, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and almost into negative territory.

"
1314,IP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1315,IP,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1316,IP,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 16.7% before rebounding to 20.5% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1317,IP,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 18.4% from 16.5% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.5% while Energy slips back to 16.5%.
"
1318,IP,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials 16.7% to 15.8%. Energy, despite being the biggest expected earner for 2008, is only in third place when it comes to index weight at 14.3%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction. Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. Just three months ago, the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 15.9%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. Over the same time, the market cap share for Financials has slipped from 17.15% to 15.76%, while Energys share has risen from 12.74% to its current 14.31%.
"
1319,IP,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.4x and based on 2009, only 10.0x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
1320,IP,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.9x, and 11.2x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 19.3x 2008 and 16.5x 2009 expectations.  Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
1321,IP,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.3x and 12.9x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.91% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.85% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.84% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
1324,IP,"With almost 97% of the S&P 500 reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is effectively complete.  Over the next several weeks many of the remaining companies should report, a portion of which have been held up due to options related restatements.  Going in this season, median fourth-quarter growth was expected at around 10%.  Companies, however, were able to post nearly 13% growth instead, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Positive analyst surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly 3:1 and six out of 10 sectors were able to post double-digit growth.  
"
1325,IP,"The Materials sector was the growth leader during the fourth quarter and remains head and shoulders above the Industrial sector, which posted the next highest year-over-year growth.  In Materials, as with many sectors, the current growth rate is expected to drop sharply in the first quarter.  For Materials, growth in the first quarter is expected to be less than half what it was in the fourth, but that is still higher than any other sector.  Large expected comparable decliners are Alcoa (AA), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), and Phelps Dodge (PD).  Note that these companies all reported triple digit growth last quarter and only IP is expected to achieve that same feat in the first.
"
1326,IP,"Lagging firms during the fourth quarter were centered in the Utility and Telecom sectors.  The median utility has posted flat fourth-quarter comps and is expected to recover slightly in the first quarter, to a 5.5% growth rate.  Telecom is the only sector in the red this quarter, with negative comps of over 10%.  Energy, which was the leader in the first three quarters of 2006 is showing only slight year-over-year growth, but then again it has some very difficult post-hurricane comparables.   Looking forward to the first quarter, every sector is currently expected to post positive growth, but only three are expected to make it into the double-digits.  
"
1327,IP,"Looking ahead, the S&P 500 is expected to post first-quarter median growth of 8.3%.  With a similar surprise ratio to that of the last couple of quarters, the growth could again make it into double-digits.

"
1329,IP,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.  For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1330,IP,"For fiscal 2007, the ratio has dropped slightly below equality.  Over the last four weeks, there were 844 upward revisions and 881 downward, yielding a total revisions ratio of 0.96.  This is down from last weeks 1.10.  For comparison, the third-quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.4 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.  Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
1331,IP,"Given the collapse in oil prices earlier this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with nearly two cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.18.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.13, but excluding Energy it is at 1.18.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last month, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.   With the current implosion in the sub-prime mortgage market, it is somewhat surprising that the Financial sector has the second highest revisions ratio.  We would expect that to decline in coming weeks.  If it does not it will be powerful evidence that the problems are not spreading to the rest of the market and the economy.

1336,IP,"On a full-year basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single-digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 11.3% and 12.3%, respectively. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 14.8% in 2006 to 7.9% in 2007.  A rebound is then expected to 10.8% in 2008.  It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations.  Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
1337,IP,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.

"
1339,IP,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1340,IP,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1341,IP,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.4%. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.9% of the total expected earnings for 2007.
"
1342,IP,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.5% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 9.5% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 12.5% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market.  If Energy and Financials are excluded, the S&P 500 is trading for 17.6x 2007 expected earnings.
"
1343,IP,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.7x 2007 and 10.4x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.2x and 13.7x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

1350,IP,"Per Reuters, International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) has decided not to put across a hostile bid to take over its Ireland-based rival, Smurfit Kappa. The company was given time up to Jun 6 to make a binding offer for the buyout, by the Irish Takeover Panel.In March, International Paper’s bid to take over Smurfit Kappa was rejected by the European rival citing gross undervaluation and arguing that it was better served pursuing its future as an independent company. The proposal included a cash-and-stock offer of €25.25 in cash along with 0.3 new shares of International Paper for each share of Smurfit. The previous offer valued the Irish group at €8.9 billion.International Paper has changed its terms to offer Smurfit shareholders a ""mix and match"" facility that would allow them to receive a greater or lesser proportion of cash or shares.  At the outset, the company stressed the importance of proceeding on an agreed basis. It believes that its current proposal represents a compelling strategic and financial rationale for a merger with Smurfit Kappa.  In that context, International Paper has confirmed that it will not proceed with a binding offer unless it is recommended by Smurfit Kappa's board of directors. Also, the company confirmed that it would seek a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange, to enable Smurfit Kappa shareholders to realize the potential value of the transaction.However, Smurfit Kappa believes that International Paper’s latest proposal has failed to value its intrinsic business worth and it is very comfortable with the position outlined to its shareholders. International Paper suggested that the two companies should meet to discuss the potential for the combined firm.International Paper continues to restructure itself to transform into a core packaging company. M&As remain a key strategy to strengthen its long-term business proposition.  The company is taking initiatives to improve its operating margins over time across the business. However, over the past three months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 6.6% compared with decline of 2.5% for the latter.International Paper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Domtar Corporation (UFS  -  Free Report), KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report) and Neenah, Inc. (NP  -  Free Report).

1354,IP,"Per a Bloomberg report, packaging products-maker Bemis Company Inc. (BMS  -  Free Report) is the takeover target of Australian company, Amcor Limited. Following the report, Bemis’ shares surged 10% to close at $46.90 on Sep 7.  Amcor is working with advisers in order to prepare a bid for Neenah, WI-based Bemis, which has a current market capitalization of $4.47 billion. The company offers multilayer polymer, blown and cast film structures as well as injection molded plastic and folding carton packaging products. Its products are utilized in producing packaging for food, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, and industrial applications. It sells its products through direct sales force in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Is Bemis Worth a Takeover Bid? Bemis’s recent results were nothing to write home about. In the first half of 2017, the company’s earnings declined 17%. In both the quarters of 2017, Bemis’ earnings failed to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the trailing four quarters, the company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 5.89%. During second-quarter conference call, Bemis lowered 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.35-$2.50 from the prior range of $2.50-$2.60, citing the impact of sharp contraction and tough economic environment in Brazil. The mid-point of the guidance reflects a year-over-year decline of 10%. The estimates for third-quarter 2017, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, have moved south in the past 30 days, reflecting the negative outlook of analysts. For the third quarter, the estimate has gone down 11% to 64 cents per share. For fiscal 2017, the estimate has dipped 6% to $2.40 in the past 30 days. For fiscal 2018, the estimate has gone down 6% to $2.67 per share.During March, certain of Bemis’ large U.S. core consumer packaged goods customers lowered volume projections for the balance of 2017. These lower volumes, along with the operational inefficiencies associated with the lower volumes, will impact Bemis’ sales and earnings for 2017. Further, the political instability and challenging economic environment in Brazil continues to impact business. In June, Bemis announced details about its restructuring and cost savings plan to improve profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Latin American businesses by reducing manufacturing and administrative cost structure. These efforts are likely to generate total cost savings of $55–$60 million, with savings starting in 2017 and fully realized during 2019. In the past year, its shares have declined 4.5% in contrast with 9.3% rise recorded by the industry. The company continues to bear the brunt of a flat-to-declining U.S. packaged food market. In eight of the past nine years, volumes in the core flexible packaging business have been flat to down as Bemis continues to struggle within a complex supply chain. The stock price underperformance could make shareholders welcome an offer by Amcor. Bemis is currently trading at a forward 12-month Enterprise Value/ EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 10.3 while the industry’s 12-month forward EV/EBITDA ratio is pegged higher at 12.4. This implies that the stock is cheap at current levels. Manifold Benefits to Amcor Amcor Limited provides packaging solutions in Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and internationally. The company manufactures rigid plastic containers for a range of beverage and food products. It also manufactures flexible and film packaging for the food and beverage industry as well as pet food packaging; and medical and pharmaceutical, fresh produce, and snack food segments. The company also offers flexible packaging for specialty folding cartons for tobacco packaging and other industries; and packaging solutions for home and personal care products. If the takeover happens, it, would make Amcor the world's fourth-biggest packaging company surpassing can maker Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) but behind big three paper and pulp businesses — International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report), WestRock Company and Oji Holdings Corporation. The transaction would be in sync with the Amcor’s long endeavor to shift from metal and glass to plastics. Further, Bemis would increase exposure to the Americas from around a third of revenues to more than half.  Bemis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stocks in the same space includes  Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1355,IP,"Paper and packaging products manufacturer, International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) recently completed the divesture of its foodservice business in China. The assets were sold to Huhtamaki Hong Kong Limited, one of the world’s largest packaging companies with 68 manufacturing units and 23 sales offices in 34 countries, for an undisclosed amount. The divested asset portfolio included two manufacturing plants with employee strength of roughly 200.The foodservice business of International Paper offers innovative single-use packaging solutions to cater to the evolving needs of its customers. The company manufactures hot and cold cups, food containers and buckets, lids and accessories, as well as various environment-friendly options for foodservice establishments across the country — from one-store locations to large national chains. These products are developed from responsibly managed forests as the company remains committed to improving its environmental footprint through sustainable business practices.Over the past couple of years, the company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the Chinese and Asian markets more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and exports from the United States and other parts of the world.Last year, International Paper sold its corrugated packaging business in China and Southeast Asia to Xiamen Bridge Hexing Equity Investment Partnership Enterprise, which specializes in packaging and related industries, for approximately RMB 1 billion ($150 million). These included 18 manufacturing plants with employee strength of about 3,000.In 2015, the company also sold 55% equity interest in its Chinese coated-board joint venture with Shandong Sun Holding Group Co., Ltd. for RMB 149 million (roughly $23 million). The joint venture had one manufacturing facility in the Shandong Province, which produced about 1.4 million metric tons of coated-board products.Moving forward, International Paper intends to focus more resources on high-return capital projects within its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth. The company has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 3.1% compared with a 6.8% gain for the latter. International Paper is undergoing restructuring initiatives to transform itself into a core packaging company. It intends to invest $300 million through 2017 to further improve its North American containerboard mill system, enhance product quality and reduce manufacturing and delivery costs. These projects are expected to have a collective internal rate of return of 20%.International Paper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Mondi plc (MONDY  -  Free Report), Smurfit Kappa Group plc (SMFKY  -  Free Report) and Taseko Mines Limited (TGB  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1357,IP,"Paper and packaging firm International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) reported relatively healthy second-quarter 2017 results with adjusted operating earnings of $270 million or 65 cents per share compared with $379 million or 92 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Although operating earnings declined year over year, it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.GAAP earnings for the quarter were $80 million or 19 cents per share compared with $40 million or 10 cents in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by top-line growth.Net sales improved to $5,772 million in the reported quarter compared with $5,322 million in the year-ago quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,678 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to benefits from the pulp business that was acquired in late 2016.International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | International Paper Company QuoteTotal business segment operating profit in the reported quarter was $129 million compared with $627 million in second-quarter 2016. The significant year-over-year decrease in operating profit was attributable to the adverse impact of the Kleen Products settlementSegment PerformanceIndustrial Packaging: Sales from this segment increased to $3,706 million from $3,520 million in the year-ago period. Operating profit decreased to $50 million from $458 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to $354 million in charges to settle the Kleen Products legal case. In North America, sales price increase realizations for containerboard and boxes and strong demand for U.S. kraft linerboard exports were partially offset by higher mill outage expenses and OCC (old corrugated containers) costs.  Printing Papers: Sales from this segment were $1,017 million in the reported quarter versus $1,012 million in the year-earlier quarter. Operating profit for the segment was $86 million versus $117 million in the year-ago quarter due to lower sales volumes, heavy maintenance outage expenses and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher export sales volume from Brazil.Consumer Packaging: Sales from this segment decreased to $474 million from $501 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating loss was $14 million compared with operating profit of $73 million in the year-ago quarter due to annual outage expenses and reliability issues at the Augusta, GA mill.International Paper combined its legacy pulp business with the acquired pulp business to form a new business segment called Global Cellulose Fibers. Sales from this segment were $612 million compared with $259 million in the prior-year quarter due to record fluff pulp sales volume as global demand remained strong. Operating profit was $7 million compared with operating loss of $21 million a year ago, largely driven greater synergy benefits, favorable pricing, lower manufacturing costs and lower planned maintenance outage expenses.Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, cash and temporary investments aggregated $1,041 million while long-term debt was $10,392 million. Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of the year was $1,278 million compared with $1,225 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow for quarter was $355 million compared with $527 million in the prior-year period, bringing the respective tallies for the first half of 2017 and 2016 to $614 million and $838 million.Moving ForwardManagement expects strong second half results, as well as positive momentum entering 2018.  The company is likely to generate significant year-over-year earnings growth and continued strong cash flow in 2017. International Paper expects solid traction in the future with price increases, acquisition synergies and significantly lower outage expenses, thereby remaining confident to achieve its full year earnings target.International Paper currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1359,IP,"Leading packaging and paper manufacturer International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates thrice with an average positive surprise of 4.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDuring the quarter, International Paper inked a definitive agreement to divest its foodservice business in China. The foodservice business offers innovative single-use packaging solutions, catering to the evolving needs of its customers. Over the past couple of years, the company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the Chinese and Asian markets more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and exports from the U.S. and other parts of the world. The company is taking initiatives to drive further margin expansion over time across the businesses.However, International Paper depends heavily on raw materials such as wood fiber, purchased in the form of pulpwood, wood chips and old corrugated containers (OCC), and certain chemicals, including caustic soda and starch, energy sources, principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil. Rising energy, chemical and OCC costs remain headwinds, particularly under harsh winter conditions. This is likely to lower its profitability to some extent.International Paper has a huge burden of pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting the positives from its acquisition binge, a primary growth driver.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that International Paper is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.56%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 64 cents while the Most Accurate estimate stands at 63 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.International Paper Company Price and EPS Surprise  International Paper Company Price and EPS Surprise | International Paper Company QuoteZacks Rank: International Paper has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Agenus Inc. (AGEN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +5.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.Align Technology, Inc.

It will also secure another 50,000 tons under a long-term contract with a newly created company, formed from the remaining assets of U.S. Corrugated.In the past year, the company has also made several investments in areas like the attractive growing segments of consumer packaging in the fields of health care, cosmetics, confectionery and high-end spirits.  The company is also divesting businesses that were not core to its goal of being a premier provider of paper and packaging solutions.WestRock is a provider of paper and packaging solutions to consumer and corrugated markets.
