0,OMC,"WPP (WPPGY) shares are plunging after the world's largest advertising company cut its full-year revenue forecast amid lower spending by customers, in particular consumer-goods manufacturers.WPP said like-for-like revenue growth is expected to be 0% and 1% in 2017. That's down from an earlier 2% forecast.  The stock fell as much as 12 percent in London, the worst drop in 17 years. U.S. shares fell 11% to 91 in morning trade on the stock market today in New York.Advertising companies worldwide are being hit as big clients like Unilever (UN) and Procter & Gamble (PG) focus on cost-cutting to cope with sluggish global economic growth and technological disruption. London-based WPP singled out ad spending on consumer goods — items such as laundry detergent and toothpaste that make up about one-third of its revenue  — as coming under particular pressure.Consumer-goods giant Unilever, one of WPP's biggest customers, said earlier this year that it would cut ad output by 30% and halve the number of creative agencies it works with to 1,500 from 3,000. That followed a failed takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC), which was the ""seminal"" moment in the first quarter, according to WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell.""That sent a shockwave through the industry,"" Sorrell said by phone. ""It obviously had an effect in terms of people spending, particularly in the packaged goods sector.""WPP, which also works for brands such as Ford (F) and Marks & Spencer, had already seen its shares fall 12% this year through Tuesday amid a difficult economic climate and pressure on its businesses in North America. It's now down more than 20% year-to-date in London. Its biggest rivals, including Interpublic Group (IPG), Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (OMC), are each down more than 8% this year.Publicis dropped 2.9% in Paris, while IPG and Omnicom were down more than 4% in U.S. trading. Shares of European television companies including TF1, ProSiebenSat.1 Mediaand ITVc declined as well.In March, WPP had its biggest drop since the financial crisis when WPP gave its initial forecast for 2% growth, the slowest pace since 2009.In the second quarter, WPP's like-for-like net sales fell 0.5% with July declining 2.6%, and North America and Western Continental Europe were the poorest performing regions.""Some of the weakness was expected, however this is still an incremental disappointment,"" Tamsin Garrity, an analyst at Jefferies Group, said in a research note.WPP said that it didn't experience any significant loss in revenue from clients or of data from a cyberattack it suffered in June. The attack took down WPP's website and caused disruptions across businesses including the creative agency Ogilvy and Mather, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.The attack cost WPP about $10 million, $5 million of which was covered by insurance, Sorrell said. The company will spend about $10 million to $15 million annually on increased protection against future attacks, he said.

75,OMC,"Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17, before the opening bell.While we expect the company to witness top-line growth on the back of strategic business initiatives, higher organic growth and change in currency rates, lower U.S tax rates are likely to  have a positive impact on Omnicom’s earnings.We observe that shares of Omnicom have depreciated 15.1% over the past year against the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 13.8%. Organic Growth & Favorable Currency Likely to Drive Top LineThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.61 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%. We expect the company to witness top-line growth on the back of higher organic growth and positive currency impacts.The company expects foreign currency to have a positive impact of around 3-4% on first-quarter 2018 revenues. The guidance calls for more improvement than the 2.4% impact in fourth-quarter 2017.In the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues had declined 1.5%. Organic growth was 1.6% in the quarter.Omnicom Group Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Omnicom Group Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Omnicom Group Inc. Quote Strategic investments, organizational changes and important acquisitions as well as partnerships and expansion efforts coupled with business opportunities are other factors which will drive the company’s top-line growth. The company’s strong competitive position across advertising and marketing business is a positive. Increasing global presence acts as another key growth catalyst. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive.Tax Cut to Positively Impact Bottom LineThe new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective from December 2017), which reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, will benefit Omnicom’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. The company projects 2018 effective tax rates to reduce 350-450 basis points (bps). Notably, the consensus estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.05 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 8.3%.In fourth quarter 2017, earnings fell 25.9% from the year-ago quarter.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.

Net income for the reported quarter was $254.4 million or $1.09 per share compared with $350.3 million or $1.47 per share in the year-ago quarter.

For full year 2017, adjusted earnings were $5.10 per share compared with $4.78 in 2016.RevenuesQuarterly revenues declined 1.5% year over year to $4,176.6 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,206 million.

80,OMC,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 15. Last quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 1.5%, beating estimates on each occasion.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterMarketing and media budgets usually have a positive correlation with the economy. Consequently, media spending is currently trending up buoyed by reduced corporate taxes that have led to higher client spends and advertising budgets. Moreover, there has been a marked shift in the recent years as media consumption patterns have evolved from traditional to digital media.Omnicom is likely to witness healthy performance in developed markets like the United States and developing markets like Asia. The company is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. It is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs are likely to boost earnings.However, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. In the present scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, the company is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs, which thereby could affect its bottom line.Moreover, as the company expands its international operations, it highly exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. The company also faces huge concentration risk as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,206 million compared with revenues of $4,242 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +0.05%.

87,OMC,"Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before the opening bell.While we expect the company’s top line to do well on the back of revenue growth across most of the regions, lower U.S tax rates are likely to have a positive impact on Omnicom’s earnings.We observe that shares of Omnicom have gained 5.2% year to date compared with the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 4.0%. Top Line to Improve Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.92 billion, indicating year-over-year increase of 3.4%. We expect the company to witness top-line growth across most of the regions.Region-wise, the consensus estimate for North America revenues indicates an improvement of 4.1% year over year to $2.27 billion. The same for Latin America is expected to rise 2.5% year over year to $124 million, 3.1% year over year to $361 million for U.K., 3.9% year over year to $421 million for Asia Pacific and 17.5% year over year to $778 million for Euro & Other Europe. Middle East and Africa are expected to remain stable at around $73 million.In first-quarter 2018, the company’s revenues increased 1.2% year over year. Organic growth was 2.4% in the quarter.Across regional markets, revenues from Latin America increased 1.7% year over year to $108.4 million. Asia Pacific recorded a 4.5% increase in revenues to $392 million, Euro & Other Europe improved 23.1% to $712.1 million and the U.K. recorded a 15.8% improvement to $358 million. However, revenues from North America reduced 7.2% year over year to $1,985.7 million and the same from the Middle East and Africa were down 7% to $73.4 million.Earnings Likely to Grow on Tax Reform The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, will benefit Omnicom’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $1.55, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.7%.In first-quarter 2018, earnings increased 11.8% year over year. The company also enjoyed a lower income tax rate of 24.3% and a $13 million reduction in income tax expense (due to successful resolution of foreign tax claims) in the first quarter.For full year 2018, the company anticipates an effective tax rate of 28.1% (excluding any potential tax benefit from share-based compensation).Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.81%.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Business Services sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in second-quarter 2018:Aptiv PLC (APTV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.49% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report quarterly numbers on Jul 31. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report quarterly results on Jul 24.Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.17% and a Zacks Rank #1.

88,OMC,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 17. In the quarter, the company is likely to report flat revenues in North America, which accounts for more than half of the total corporate revenues.Whether this will hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Shrinking Ad BudgetsMarketing and media budgets usually have a positive correlation with the economy. However, media spending is currently trending in the opposite direction as continued uncertainty related to Trump’s proposed policy changes and taxes have led to a drastic reduction in advertising budgets and client spends. Moreover, there has been a marked shift in the recent years as media consumption patterns have evolved from traditional to digital media.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the North American market in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,187 million compared with second-quarter revenues of approximately $2,176 million. Revenues from Europe and Latin America are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $933 million and $111 million compared with reported revenues of $1,013 million and $121 million in the prior quarter.In the present scenario, when the European economy is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for Omnicom to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit is also likely to result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company.Other Key FactorsStrengthening U.S. dollar is further likely to affect Omnicom's revenues. As the company expands its international operations, it highly exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. In addition, the company faces huge concentration risk as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. The lacklustre top-line performance is expected to contribute to sequentially lower earnings in the impending quarterly results.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00% as both stand at $1.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Omnicom Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Omnicom Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Omnicom Group Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Synovus Financial Corp.

92,OMC,"Investors in Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 20, 2018 $90.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Omnicom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Omnicom is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Advertising and Marketing industry that ranks in the Bottom 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.57 per share to $1.56 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Omnicom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

94,OMC,"Digital advertisements have been gaining widespread popularity since some time now. This can be primarily attributed to low costs and an algorithmically narrowed target audience compared to television advertisements. Per a recent report by Magna Global, digital ad spending will constitute almost 50% of total spending for advertisements in the United States in 2018.In such a scenario, companies offering digital advertisement platforms have been witnessing a surge in demand for their offerings eventually adding to their top-line growth.Google & Facebook’s Waning Dominance in Digital Ad SpendingThe most prominent names in this space are Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), given their market share in digital advertising spending, which surpasses that of the other players combined together.However, it is important to note that the combined market share is expected to witness a decline in 2018 per a recent report by eMarketer. The share of the two companies in the digital advertising spending, which was recorded at 58.9% in 2017, is expected to decline to 56.8% in 2018 and to 55.6% in 2020.eMarketer also forecasts digital ad spending to reach $273.29 billion in 2018 and $357.31 billion by 2020 from $232.27 billion in 2017.Notably, Facebook generated around 98% of its total revenues from advertising in 2017. In comparison, , Google’s ad revenues contributed to 86% of its total revenues during the same period. Both the companies registered year over year growth in advertising revenues.However, in a situation where spending for digital advertisements is poised to increase, declining share of Facebook and Google is an area of concern for these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies. This is all the more true as the advertising segment is the largest revenue contributor for both the companies.Is Amazon Stealing Share?Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) seems to be the underdog in this domain and can turn into an indomitable force given its huge base of online shoppers.In first-quarter 2018, Amazon recorded revenues of $2.03 billion at its “Other” segment, which primarily consists of sales of advertising services. This figure marked a whopping year-over-year increase of 130%, much higher than Facebook’s 50.1% and Google’s 23.5%.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteNotably, the use of the new accounting standard added about $560 million to its Other revenue segment in the first quarter of 2018. There was a significant increase in segment revenues even when these changes were adjusted.Per eMarketer’s Monica Peart, senior director of forecasting, Amazon, currently fifth among the digital advertisement platform providers in the United States, is on track to reach the third position by 2020.Management is counting on this comparatively higher margin segment as a potentially strong contributor. Reportedly, Amazon has been testing the standing of its advertising offerings against Facebook and Google.Notable marketing firm Omnicom’s (OMC  -  Free Report) CEO John Wren stated that Amazon is “coming over the hill” and posing a bigger threat to Google and Facebook.We believe Amazon’s ad initiatives will  be a major driving force to achieve the growth projected for digital ad spending through 2020 and beyond.Amazon currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

95,OMC,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 5.8%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 10.8% and 7.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past six months. Shares of Omnicom have gained 7.4% compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 4.9% in the said time frame. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s higher organic growth and benefits from strategic investments, acquisitions and expansion efforts.Robust Organic GrowthWe appreciate Omnicom’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To increase efficiency, the company has been making internal investments in its agencies and back office operations. It has also raised its internal investments in data, analytics and precision marketing. Driven by such positives, we expect Omnicom to witness higher revenues on the back of organic growth.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 2.4% increase in total revenues. It marked an improvement from 1.6% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Growing Digital and Analytical CapabilitiesOmnicom is expanding its suite in the areas of digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets.On Apr 16, 2018, Omnicom’s media services division, Omnicom Media Group announced a partnership with IRI. Per the deal, IRI will serve as a preferred consumer packaged goods (CPG) data provider for Omnicom Media Group’s data and analytics division, Annalect. In Germany, Omnicom media group acquired Brain Group, a digitally-focused agency for media planning, marketing and transformation consulting and content creation.Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive. All these initiatives augur well for the long-term growth and stability of the company.Encouraging Balance SheetManagement has executed well in the recent times. This has helped Omnicom build cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $3.79 billion in 2017. The company’s cash position has improved considerably in the past few years. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company had $3.02 billion, $2.62 billion and $2.39 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.The company generated $2.02 billion of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $1.95 billion in 2016. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Omnicom’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Omnicom paid dividends of $515.2 million, $505.4 million and $496.7 million to its shareholders, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $568.4 million, $602.2 million and $727.5 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the period from 2008 through Mar 31, 2018, Omnicom distributed 106% of net income to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Omnicom’s performance in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.2%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57, indicating year-over-year growth of 12.1%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

100,OMC,"On Oct 6, we issued an updated research report on global marketing and corporate communications firm, Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report).Growth DriversOmnicom’s performance in developed markets like the United States and developing markets like Asia has been steady. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs have helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.Also, Omnicom is concentrating on strengthening its business and expanding its client base globally through the acquisition of complementary companies. The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. We expect it to witness higher revenues in the imminent future on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date loss of 10.2% compared with a decline of 14.3% for the latter. In order to spur growth, Omnicom started using open-source technique to access the current information in the market. The increasing demand for media services, speedy growth of technologies and massive proliferation of channels are likely to translate into incremental revenues in the future.HeadwindsOmnicom forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Various agencies and media service providers compete with each other to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Also, keeping in view the service-oriented nature of the industry, it becomes imperative for the company to increase the count of talented employees and retain the existing ones. These factors are likely to pose some challenges for it.Furthermore, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. At present, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable, particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, it is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs, which thereby affects its bottom line and undermines its organic growth to some extent.Moving ForwardNevertheless, we remain impressed with Omnicom’s focused growth initiatives and expect it to witness higher revenues in the future.Omnicom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and PageGroup plc , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and Stantec Inc. (STN  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Accenture has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.3%.

105,OMC,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Omnicom’s earnings track record has been quite healthy, having beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.71%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Key Factors Omnicom remains poised on its strategy of making internal investments and accretive acquisitions to further strengthen its core capabilities.The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. The companyexpects to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.In addition, Omnicom is witnessing a healthy performance in developed markets like the U.S. and developing markets like Asia. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology firms in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.However, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. In the present scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, the company is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs. This is likely to affect the bottom line and undermine its organic growth to some extent.Furthermore, a significant portion of the revenues is derived in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This is likely to adversely impact the company’s financial results due to volatility in currency exchange rates. As Omnicom expands its international operations, it exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. The company also faces huge concentration risks as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. These developments might prove to be a strain on Omnicom in the impending quarter.  For the to-be-reported-quarter, Omnicom’s revenues are anticipated to be affected by the volatility in the market. In addition, client spending patterns in the global markets are likely to be constrained by a challenging macroeconomic environment and geopolitical scenario.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  -0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.38 while the consensus estimate is pegged higher at $1.39. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Omnicom Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Omnicom Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Omnicom Group Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.
