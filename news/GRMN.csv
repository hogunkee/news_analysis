0,GRMN,"Fitness band maker Fitbit (FIT) continues to lead the wearable device market by worldwide unit shipments, but smartwatch maker Apple (AAPL) is catching up.Fitbit grabbed 22.2% market share in the third quarter, shipping 4.7 million devices, research firm IDC reported Thursday. But that's down from 24.3% market share in the second quarter.Meanwhile, Apple narrowed the gap with Fitbit in Q3, shipping 3.9 million Apple Watch units. It remained in second place with 18.6% market share, down from 19.9% in Q2 when the Apple Watch debuted.Chinese consumer electronics firm Xiaomi kept the No. 3 spot with 17.4% market share. It shipped 3.7 million activity trackers in the third quarter, IDC said.Garmin (GRMN) held on to the No. 4 spot with 4.1% market share, IDC said.Chinese vendor XTC, a subsidiary of BBK, narrowly beat Samsung for the No. 5 position. XTC is focused exclusively on the China market with just one device: the Y01, a children's phone watch, IDC reported. XTC claimed 3.1% market share in Q3.Overall shipments of wearable devices rose 198% year over year in Q3 to 21 million units, IDC said.So far, smartwatches and fitness bands are coexisting with little cannibalization in the market, IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement. Both categories grew sequentially and year over year in Q3.The categories are differentiated by applications as well as price. The average smartwatch cost just over $400 in Q3, compared with $94 for a fitness band, Ubrani said.IDC is predicting a shakeout in the wearables market soon, with over half of today's vendors exiting the market by 2020.Vote Of Confidence For FitbitFitbit (FIT) stock has been beaten down over concerns of slowing demand and increasing competition in the fitness band market. But Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy gave the company a vote of confidence in a report Thursday.Murphy reiterated her overweight rating on Fitbit with a price target of 60. Fitbit was up nearly 3%, above 30, in late morning trading on the stock market today. Fitbit went public at 20 in June and peaked at 51.90 in August.""While there continues to be a lot of concern in the marketplace on the longevity of Fitbit, we believe the brand is strong, the international growth opportunity is real, and the long-term vectors into health care all support upside to shares,"" she said.RELATED:Fitbit, Apple Watch Demand Up Ahead Of Holidays.Apple Watch Dominates, But New Competition Coming.Wearables To U.S. Adults: You're Putting Me On.

1,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) stock went on a post-Thanksgiving turkey trot on Monday after getting an analyst upgrade. Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock on Monday upgraded Fitbit stock to overweight from equal weight with a price target of 49. Fitbit was up more than 2.5%, near 28.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Fitbit, the top maker of activity trackers and fitness bands, went public on June 18 at 20. It climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5 before investors got vertigo. Its shares tumbled on concerns about increased competition and profit erosion.Fitbit's recent stock decline is unwarranted, McClintock said in a research report. The company has ""meaningful catalysts"" ahead including holiday season sales, the CES trade show, new product launches and corporate wellness deals, he said.""Considering that Fitbit is the fastest-growing meaningful consumer company in the world at 140%+ revenue year over year in 2015 (in a world lacking true growth stories), we believe the current valuation levels are just too compelling to ignore,"" he said.Wearables appear to be one of the winning product categories this holiday and Fitbit is the brand of choice, according to retail channel checks, he said. Plus, Fitbit was less discounted than its peers over the Black Friday weekend, McClintock said.Retailers Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) cited strong wearable device sales in recent reports.""We estimate that Fitbit can grow annual revenue by at least 40% over the next several years, which could ultimately prove conservative (our upside case is for Fitbit to grow revenue almost 70% over the next several years),"" McClintock said. ""Our estimates for revenue growth are entirely driven by overall category growth/consumer adoption as well as geographic expansion (Fitbit's global operations currently represent less than 25% of sales).""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said his retail channel checks on Black Friday indicated soft in-store fitness tracker sales. However, online sales may have offset weaker brick-and-mortar sales.Fitbit saw ""slightly disappointing in-store demand,"" Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Our checks indicate that wearable devices overall, and Fitbit specifically, underperformed store expectations on Black Friday, driven by strong Apple Watch sales and a likely channel shift toward online,"" he said. ""Historically, Fitbit has done as much as 40% of its sales through online channels, and we think this holiday could index above those levels. So while we're noting the in-store feedback as a modest negative, we're not ruling out that the fitness category's likely higher proclivity toward online channels may have provided Fitbit some offset to this softness.""Erickson rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 47.Fitbit likely didn't see any meaningful market share loss to rival activity trackers from Garmin (GRMN) and others over Black Friday weekend, he said. But Apple 's (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch, which was discounted by some retailers, could have impacted wearables demand, he said.RELATED:Fitbit, Apple Watch demand up ahead of holidaysFitbit takes ill as secondary stock offer cuts value.

""Despite recent broader retail concerns, we believe both Fitbit and Apple remain well positioned into the holidays.""Power rates Fitbit and Apple stocks as outperform.Baird surveyed over 4,500 U.S. consumers in the first week of November. Some 24.5% of respondents said that they plan to buy a fitness tracker in the next three months.

That's up from 44.3% in August and 35.6% a year ago, Baird said.Apple Watch purchase intent grew slightly in the latest survey to 5.4% of all respondents from 5% in August and 4.1% in December 2014 (before the product was launched).""We view this as a solid momentum, particularly given this survey was focused on activity tracker interest as opposed to the broader Apple Watch capabilities,"" Power said.By comparison, 12.1% of all respondents plan to buy a Fitbit tracker, up from 9.5% in August and 5% a year ago, Baird said.Roughly 25% of respondents claim that they own a fitness tracker of some sort, with Fitbit the clear leader at 11.3%, followed by Garmin (GRMN) at 3.7%, Apple at 2.4% and Jawbone at 1.9%.RELATED:Did Apple Watch give Fossil its 'BlackBerry moment'?Fitbit takes ill as secondary stock offer cuts value.

Garmin's $330 Forerunner 235 GPS running watch fills a ""significant gap"" in its product lineup, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Wednesday. He rates Garmin stock as neutral.""Garmin has historically shied away from optical heart rate monitors, believing them to be less accurate than chest-worn straps,"" Anderson said. ""But the popularity of on-wrist monitors (from Fitbit (FIT), Apple (AAPL), Jawbone, Sony (SNE), Motorola, Samsung, etc.) has made it a necessary competitive feature.""Earlier this year, Garmin released the $300 Forerunner 225 running watch with a heart-rate monitor licensed from Mio.

""At the moment, we believe Garmin is at a competitive disadvantage to Fitbit by not having the technology on at least one of its activity tracker products.""Garmin announced two other running watches on Wednesday, but neither includes an optical heart-rate monitor. They are the $250 Forerunner 230 and $400 Forerunner 630.""The reason Garmin did not equip the higher-end device (630) with an optical HRM is due to the fact that the company believes this device will be purchased by the high-end runner that prefers accuracy (chest strap) and due to a decision to pack the 630 and companion chest strap with extra sensors for measurements such as ground contact time,"" Anderson said.The three new running watches will ship later this quarter.

125,GRMN,"GoPro (GPRO) decided to go low with its latest product moves ahead of the holiday shopping season. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company cut the price of its Hero4 Session action camera by $100, or 25%, to $299.99, and introduced a new entry-level action camera, the Hero+. The Hero+ costs $199.99 and includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for easy sharing of photos and videos.
"
126,GRMN,"GoPro cutting the price of its Hero4 Session is confirmation that the tiny camera, launched on July 12, is selling poorly.

128,GRMN,"""Both moves strike us as extremely logical,"" Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research report Monday. ""For starters, we believe the single largest hole in the GoPro portfolio has been an entry-level device that is of a reasonable quality and easy to use.
"
129,GRMN,"""Last year's $130 Hero camera only captured 1080p video at 30 frames per second and did not come with Wi-Fi on-board. Thus, it struggled to out-sell the more expensive devices even on a unit basis despite the low cost.""

130,GRMN,"The Hero+ camera captures video in 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, plus 8 megapixel single, time-lapse and burst photos. The device is waterproof and mountable using GoPro's array of mounts and accessories. It will be available starting Sunday.

""For starters, we believe the single largest hole in the GoPro portfolio has been an entry-level device that is of a reasonable quality and easy to use.""Last year's $130 Hero camera only captured 1080p video at 30 frames per second and did not come with Wi-Fi on-board. Thus, it struggled to out-sell the more expensive devices even on a unit basis despite the low cost.""The Hero+ camera captures video in 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, plus 8 megapixel single, time-lapse and burst photos. The device is waterproof and mountable using GoPro's array of mounts and accessories. It will be available starting Sunday.A 'Holiday' Price""We would expect heavy promotion of the Hero+ around the holidays and $200 is a key 'gift' price point,"" Anderson said.The Hero4 Session price drop is not a surprise, he said. It comes after GoPro executives admitted recently that the camera has not lived up to expectations.""The price of the Session was a criticism we saw consistently in media reviews and it appears consumers agreed,"" Anderson said. He rates GoPro stock a buy, with a price target of 70.GoPro's product lineup this holiday season includes six cameras: Hero ($129.99), Hero+ ($199.99), Hero+ LCD ($299.99), Hero4 Session ($299.99), Hero4 Silver ($399.99) and Hero4 Black ($499.99).""Whether mounted to a weather balloon floating 100,000 feet above the earth to capture a sunrise across the stratosphere or in the hands of a child recording their backyard tree house adventures, Hero+ is built to capture your imagination wherever it takes you,"" GoPro founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman said in a statement. ""Even as we continue to raise the bar for our highest performing cameras like Hero4 Black, Silver and Session, we remain committed to developing simplified products like Hero+ that make GoPro life-capture accessible to everyone.""GoPro cameras compete with products from Garmin (GRMN), Sony (SNE) and others.RELATED:GoPro undergoing 'valuation reset' with investors.

In fiscal 2014, Under Armour generated revenue of $3.08 billion and sees 2015 revenue of $3.84 billion.""We expect growth opportunities in footwear and int'l to be highlighted as these are likely the largest incremental growth drivers, with an updated goal for 2018 int'l penetration (estimate ~20% int'l penetration by 2018),"" wrote Anderson.Under Armour overtook Adidas to become No. 2 in the domestic sportswear marketing early in 2015, and it has cast an eye abroad with sponsorships of various athletes that include British tennis star, Andy Murray.The company might also provide investors a peek at its 2016 Olympics strategy, said FBR, which has a 105 price target and outperform rating on Under Armour.RELATED:Nike Loses Brand Slam At Tennis' U.S. OpenNike, Under Armour Get Pre-Labor Day Sales Lift

228,GRMN,"Under Armour (UA) still a distant second to Nike in sportswear revenue, but the Baltimore-based challenger is looking to unseat the champion through an off-court battleground: by becoming the Facebook of fitness.

We will be the destination for health and fitness,"" said Under Armour (UA) CEO Kevin Plank at the company's recent investor day. ""We will connect the dots. We will connect the sensors all into one place. That is our vision.""
"
230,GRMN,"Plank's strategy hinges on the belief that every product ""eventually is going to have a chip in it."" And he's backing that up with manpower: the company's digital team is expected to exceed 500 people in 2016, up from 60 in 2013.
"
231,GRMN,"His dream — embodied in an initiative called ""Connected Fitness"" — started to take shape this year with the acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo. The moves beefed up Under Armour's existing app suite, which included MapMyFitness (a 2013 buy) and UA Record, and expanded its reach to tens of millions more fitness enthusiasts.
"
232,GRMN,"Lessons From Amazon
"
233,GRMN,"With its apps, the company wants to know everything about its users — ""what you put in your body, how well you slept, how far you ran, how far you usually run"" — to make recommendations and sell more products.
"
234,GRMN,"The approach borrows from leaders in the tech space. Under Armour said that Amazon (AMZN) attributes 40% of its revenue to recommendations the e-commerce giant makes to its customers based on their search histories and previous purchases.
"
235,GRMN,"Whether the app-derived data lead to more sales and the dethroning of Nike (NKE) remains to be seen, but Under Armour already has the lead in one regard. Its four apps boast a total user base of 150 million, of which 60 million are active users, said Plank.
"
236,GRMN,"Nike, on the other hand, has mostly kept mum on its digital initiatives.
"
237,GRMN,"The company said in August of last year that there were more than 30 million members of Nike+ — what it calls its suite of digital products and services — but most analysts can only guess at the current number.
"
238,GRMN,"Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu told IBD that he ""would not be surprised"" if that total figure had grown to 40 million to 50 million by now, a projection that is, at best, still 10 million shy of Under Armour's current active user base.

"
243,GRMN,"With Fitbit (FIT), Jawbone and the Apple (AAPL) Watch dominating the wearable conversation, the Air Jordan maker has receded from the hardware space as well, notably laying off much of its FuelBand team last year, according to CNET.

257,GRMN,"Two new entrants in the wearable device market are giving leader Fitbit (FIT) a run for its money: Apple (AAPL) and Xiaomi. Fitbit, a maker of fitness bands and activity trackers, was No. 1 in the wearables market in the second quarter, with 24.3% market share, research firm IDC said Thursday. It shipped 4.4 million units in Q2, up 159% year over year.Apple, which launched its Apple Watch smartwatch on April 24, grabbed the No. 2 spot among wearables makers after just one full quarter on the market.Apple shipped 3.6 million smartwatches in Q2, taking 19.9% market share, IDC said.China's Xiaomi was close behind in third place with 17.1% market share. It shipped 3.1 million fitness bands in Q2. Xiaomi didn't have a wearable device on the market a year ago.Garmin (GRMN) came in fourth with 3.9% market share in Q2, followed by Samsung (3.3%). Garmin sells fitness bands and sports watches for ""citizen athletes"" such as runners, cyclists and swimmers. Samsung sells fitness bands and smartwatches.Overall shipments of wearable devices rose 223% year over year to 18.1 million in the second quarter, IDC reported.More wearables coming from Apple?""Anytime Apple enters a new market, not only does it draw attention to itself, but to the market as a whole,"" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said in a statement. ""Fairly or not, Apple will become the stick against which other wearables are measured, and competing vendors need to stay current or ahead of Apple. Now that Apple is officially a part of the wearables market, everyone will be watching to see what other wearable devices it decides to launch, such as smart glasses or hearables.""Apple currently plays in the smart wearables category, or those devices capable of running third-party applications.""About two of every three smart wearables shipped this quarter was an Apple Watch,"" IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement. ""Apple has clearly garnered an impressive lead in this space and its dominance is expected to continue. And, although Fitbit outshipped Apple, it's worth noting that Fitbit only sells basic wearables — a category that is expected to lose share over the next few years, leaving Apple poised to become the next market leader for all wearables.""Apple Watch sales are poised to grow as Apple enters new geographic markets and retail channels. The Apple Watch is for sale in just 16 countries today. Best Buy (BBY) announced Tuesday that it is expanding Apple Watch availability to all 1,050 of its U.S. big-box stores by the end of September.Apple Watch numbers varyApple has been mum about Apple Watch shipments and sales.Last month, research firm Canalys estimated Apple shipped 4.2 million smartwatches in Q2. Canalys said Apple was the top wearable device vendor ahead of Fitbit for the period.Meanwhile, Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 4 million Apple Watch units in the second quarter. Shipments measure products delivered to the sales channel, including those not yet sold.Apple did not reveal how many Apple Watches it sold in the June quarter, but analysts estimate it sold about 2 million to 2.5 million units.Research firm Tractica predicts that smartwatches will surpass fitness trackers this year to become the top type of wearable device. Last year, fitness trackers accounted for 21.6 million units, or 61% of the wearables market, which also includes wearable cameras, body sensors, smart clothing and smart glasses.This year, Tractica estimates that smartwatches will account for 24.4 million units, or 41.3% of the wearables market by shipments. By comparison, fitness trackers will account for 23.4 million units, or 39.6% of the market, Tractica said.Fitbit went public in June and IBD gives Fitbit stock a strong 92 Composite Rating out of a possible 99, while Apple holds a 69 and Garmin a low 15.

258,GRMN,"Apple (AAPL) may be going big into a technology niche — augmented reality — that one analyst calls potentially ""as profound a technology platform as the smartphone today.""With the tech giant's Sept. 9 announcement expected to be a next-gen iPhone and possibly also Siri voice-activated Apple TV, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster is looking further out.Augmented reality is likely 10 years away from broad consumer adoption, Munster said in a Monday research note, but he said Apple's ""early involvement"" in the field ""suggests the company is preparing for the next evolution of computing.""Meanwhile, the related idea of virtual reality could help recharge PC sales as soon as 2017, Northland analyst Gus Richards said in a research note Monday upgrading Intel (INTC) stock to outperform.Future Will Be SuperimposedIn these early days usually associated with special headsets, augmented reality means superimposing computer data or images on what people see in the real world. Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have delved into augmented reality — Google with Google Glass goggles and Microsoft with its HoloLens ""see-through holographic computer,"" as the company describes it.Virtual reality is similarly immersive — with Facebook (FB) deep into the field with its Oculus Rift unit — but it really means creating a fundamentally virtual world.""Based on recent acquisitions of augmented reality companies, hiring of a key Microsoft HoloLens employee, and conversations with industry contacts within the virtual and augmented reality spaces, we believe Apple has a team exploring the AR space,"" Munster wrote in his research note.Apple And The Art Of ARMunster says that Apple's ""evolving fashion advantage"" means they can uniquely develop products that ""consumers will actually want"" vs. prototype style offerings out today, so early on.Apple bought AR software company Metaio in March for $32 million, and Munster notes that it owns 171 patents and pending applications worldwide, along with 25 U.S. patents issued. He adds that Apple acquired PrimeSense for $345 million in 2013, the designer of the first Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensors. Apple has hired away the lead HoloLens audio engineer from Microsoft, Munster says.Facebook and Google are investing more in virtual reality and augmented reality too, Munster says, increasing ""the probability that VR/AR will ultimately live up to our beliefs that it is the next computing paradigm.""Facebook acquired VR startup Oculus Rift for $2 billion a little over a year ago, the maker of the Rift VR headset and related software. Its second developer conference around it, Oculus Connect, is scheduled for late September in Los Angeles.Virtual reality devices are seen growing fast over the next five years, at a compound annual rate of 106% and shipments of 43 million in 2020, according to ABI Research. The market tracker sees augmented reality smart glasses performing in a similar manner, with 21 million unit shipments in 2020 and a CAGR of 78%.Practical And VirtualBeyond headsets used for gaming and early-adopter tryouts, AR has started showing up in a more everyday way — in cars, where a heads-up display on the windshield can show turn-by-turn navigation data and things like speed and traffic alerts. Garmin (GRMN) makes an AR system, and several carmakers have also delved into heads-up displays.The local-business directory and reviews app Yelp (YELP) has a simple AR feature called Monocle that can, for instance, overlay names and ratings of restaurants — and their relative positions in space — onto a smartphone screen's camera image when walking down a street.Apple holds a Composite Rating from IBD of 74 out of a possible 99, while Facebook gets a strong 98 and Google a 97.

Fitbit's growth prospects are already reflected in the rich valuation of its stock, he said.Fitbit leapt to a record high of 48.98 in morning trading in the stock market today. In afternoon trading, Fitbit shares were up 4%, near 47.50. Fitbit went public at 20 on June 18.""From a top-line growth perspective, we see (Fitbit) revenue increasing 90% this year and an additional 29% in 2016,"" Zino said in a report. ""We are optimistic about the prospects of the overall wearables space, as we see the potential for the entire market to more than double this year, as consumer interest increases and manufacturers develop new innovative devices.""Key growth areas are international markets as well as a greater focus on health and fitness by individuals and employers.""Fitbit is well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the health and fitness category, given its market share lead position and competitive product offerings,"" Zino said.Competition Heating UpZino's biggest concern is the valuation of Fitbit stock, which has more than doubled since its IPO just four weeks ago.Competitive threats are another concern, Zino said. Fitbit competes with Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and other fitness band makers. And it is likely to see increasing competition from smartphone makers like Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Xiaomi, he said. Apple debuted the Apple Watch in April.On Monday, a bunch of Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of Fitbit.Investment banks Deutsche Bank, Piper Jaffray, Stifel and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey gave the stock a buy rating or the equivalent.But Morgan Stanley rated Fitbit as equal weight, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Raymond James rated it neutral and market perform, respectively.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Baker said Wednesday that Fitbit will give retailer Best Buy (BBY) a slight boost this year.Fitbit products could boost Best Buy same-store sales by 0.2% this year, he said. ""While this may seem paltry, when we consider that Best Buy's domestic comp was just 1% last year and up just 0.6% in Q1 2015, even a 20 basis point impact should be helpful.""In 2014, Best Buy accounted for 12% of Fitbit's total sales.

Within this category, she sees fitness bands growing at a 31% CAGR and smartwatches growing at an 82% CAGR.Two-Thirds Market ShareFitbit took 67% of the fitness band market in 2014, followed by Jawbone (14%) and Garmin (GRMN) (5%), the NPD Group says.Garmin stock also got a bump on Monday from talk of the rising wearables market, rising 5% to 46.37.Smartwatches like Apple's (AAPL) Apple Watch have health-tracking features but aren't optimized for fitness enthusiasts.Still, the Apple Watch could impact Fitbit sales, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty says.""We can't ignore Apple, though overlap (is) limited near term,"" she said in a report. ""Apple is too big and Fitbit (market) share too high to not assume some share loss, but overlap will be limited by different price points and features.""Huberty has a price target of 42 for Fitbit stock.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler set a price target of 50 but sees about as many risks as reasons to like the stock.Among the reasons to be positive about Fitbit's prospects include its massive total addressable market, low penetration rates, the corporate wellness opportunity and a strong ecosystem around health and fitness, he says.Risks include increasing competition, the potential for smartwatches to take market share, reports of high device abandonment rates and low engagement, and Jawbone's intellectual property lawsuits, Sandler says.

Fitbit shares hit their record high of 44.38 on Thursday.The San Francisco-based company made its IPO on June 18 at 20.Baird analyst William Power initiated coverage of Fitbit with an outperform rating and a price target of 52.""Fitbit is the early fitness activity tracker leader and has enjoyed strong revenue and profitability growth,"" Power said in a note Tuesday. ""Our proprietary fitness band survey and other retail channel checks suggest strong ongoing sales momentum. While valuation has gotten more stretched following strength since the IPO, we believe estimates could prove conservative and expect operating momentum to push the shares higher.""Fitbit stands to benefit from the overall growth of the wearable device market, he said. It held 85% of the U.S. fitness band market in the first quarter, with global market share closer to 34%.Fitbit's software and community of users will provide a competitive moat, Power said.

""Fitbit led in current market share and in purchase intent, and exhibited the strongest loyalty among existing owners.""Fitbit has seen strong growth and profitability, Power noted. Its revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rose 175% and 142% year over year, respectively, in 2014. ""We forecast revenue to grow 88% in 2015 and 34% in 2016, with EBITDA growing 31% and 34% over those same years,"" he said.International sales accounted for just 24% of 2014 sales, suggesting that Fitbit has ""significant upside potential"" in foreign markets, Power said.RELATED:Fitbit stock gets a workout, hits new high.

387,GRMN,"Good news for GoPro (GPRO): The action camera market is likely to see growth in unit sales and revenue through at least 2019, according to Futuresource Consulting.The worldwide action camera market grew 44% in 2014, reaching 7.6 million units, with a retail value of $3.2 billion, Futuresource said in a report Friday.Unit sales rose 38% in North America last year, but the biggest growth was in the Asia Pacific region, up 114%.While the action camera market will see continued growth for at least the next five years, a number of factors, including lengthening replacement cycles, will cause growth to slow, Futuresource said.Consumer sales, mainly for extreme sports, have accounted for the vast majority of worldwide demand to date, but professional sales are set to accelerate, driven by TV production, law enforcement and security.Consumers represented 86% of action camera sales last year, with the rest coming from professional uses.GoPro dominates the action camera market today, but is seeing competition from the likes of Garmin (GRMN), Polaroid and Sony (SNE). Other companies such as Taser (TASR) and Digital Ally (DGLY) are targeting the adjacent market of wearable cameras for police and security officers.Another key trend is price polarization, with growing sales of low-end models costing less than $200 and high-end models such GoPro's $499 Hero 4 Black.""The action camera market has undergone a great deal of development over recent months,"" Futuresource analyst Arun Gill said. ""In particular, with 360-degree capture now available, we will see virtual reality applications emerge over the coming months, especially for sports broadcasting.""Futuresource sees the percentage of action cameras that can take 360-degree video growing from 1% this year to 14% by 2019.Last year, 95% of action cameras sold took high-definition video in at least 720p resolution. About 85% of action cameras shot HD video in 1080p. And half of cameras sold were capable of recording ultra high-definition, or 4K, video.RELATED:GoPro stock dives as company debuts waterproof camera.

The maker of wearable health and fitness trackers rose 48% to 29.68 after trading as high as 31.90. Late Wednesday, Fitbit (FIT) raised $731.5 million, pricing 36.6 million shares…
"
446,GRMN,"The tech industry is always looking to create the next big thing and wearable devices appear to be it, judging by the intense attention to the upcoming IPO of Fitbit.
"
447,GRMN,"Investor interest in the maker of devices used by people to achieve health and fitness goals is at a level that one underwriter reportedly described as pandemonium.
"
448,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) plans to raise $621 million, at the midpoint of the price's range, up 38% from an earlier plan to raise $448.5 million. That would make it the fifth-largest IPO on U.S. markets this year, out of 78 thus far. It plans to offer 34.5 million shares at 17 to 19 each. That's up from 29.9 million shares at 14 to 16.
"
449,GRMN,"Fitbit's IPO, as projected, will surpass that of GoPro (GPRO), the first IPO in the wearable sector. GoPro raised $491 million with its June 2014 IPO. The maker of wearable action cameras priced at 24 and gained 31% from its IPO price on its first day. GoPro stock is up 143% from its IPO price, trading near 58.
"
450,GRMN,"Fitbit is scheduled to price late Wednesday and begin trading Thursday on the NYSE under the ticker FIT.
"
451,GRMN,"The wearables market is getting increasingly crowded. Apple (AAPL) is the latest entrant with its Apple Watch, which also has health and fitness tracking apps and became widely available on April 24. Fitbit currently leads the market.
"
452,GRMN,"Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at research firm IPOboutique.com, says despite increased competition Fitbit is in good shape.
"
453,GRMN,"""Their customer service is considered excellent,"" he said. ""Their products are getting rave reviews and it's selling itself via referrals.""
"
454,GRMN,"Sweet, who spoke to one of the IPO underwriters who told him of the pandemonium level, said that's the first time he's heard that phrase used since the May 2012 IPO of Facebook (FB), which raised $16 billion and was the largest tech IPO of the time, since surpassed by Alibaba Group (BABA).
"
455,GRMN,"""Fitbit's year-over-year growth rate has been astounding,"" Sweet said. ""Despite the so-called competition, Fitbit has an unbelievable market share.""
"
456,GRMN,"Research firm IDC estimates shipments of wearable devices tripled to 19.6 million units in 2014 from the prior year. It expects the market for wearable devices will top 126 million units in 2019.
"
457,GRMN,"THE COMPANY
"
458,GRMN,"Fitbit was founded in 2007 by James Park, who is chairman, CEO and president, and Eric Friedman, chief technology officer. Its first device shipped in 2009.
"
459,GRMN,"The San Francisco company offers a line of six wearable connected health and fitness trackers, either wrist-based or clip-on devices, plus accessories. They range in price from $59.95 to $249.95.
"
460,GRMN,"The various Fitbit devices have many functions. They can monitor heartbeats and sleep patterns, and count your steps, distance traveled and calories burned. The wristband displays real-time feedback to encourage users to become more active in their daily lives.
"
461,GRMN,"Fitbit's more advanced products include GPS connectivity to measure speed and distance. They feature deeper integration with smartphones too, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. Fitbit also sells a Wi-Fi scale that records weight, body fat and body mass. Its platform includes an online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with its devices. 
"
462,GRMN,"Fitbit has sold about 21 million devices. Its products are in more than 45,000 retail stores and more than 50 countries and online.
"
463,GRMN,"""Our platform enables all types of people to get fit their own way, whatever their interests and goals,"" Fitbit said in its prospectus. ""Our users range from people interested in improving their health and fitness through everyday activities to endurance athletes seeking to maximize their performance.""
"
464,GRMN,"NPD Group says more than 25% of U.S. consumers reported using a fitness app on their smartphone.
"
465,GRMN,"Fitbit has an 85% market share in ""connected activity trackers,"" its prospectus says, citing data from research group NPD. It described connected activity trackers as digital fitness wearables that connect to mobile devices and computers.
"
466,GRMN,"Fitbit says advances in sensors, lower power components, and longer-life batteries, with advancements in low-energy wireless, have enabled the emergence of smaller, more power-efficient connected devices that track a broader range of biometric data and fit a wide range of consumer preferences.
"
467,GRMN,"THE RESULTS
"
468,GRMN,"Fitbit reported revenue of $745.4 million in 2014, up 175% from the $271 million in the prior year. It reported net income of $131.8 million in 2014, compared with a net loss of $51.6 million.
"
469,GRMN,"As of March 31, it had cash and cash equivalents of $237.8 million and total long-term debt of $159.6 million. The company spent $112 million on sales and marketing in 2014, up from $26.8 million in the prior year. Research and development spending was $54 million, up from $27.8 million.
"
470,GRMN,"Fitbit says it sold 10.9 million devices in '14, more than double the 4.5 million sold in the prior year.
"
471,GRMN,"RISKS/CHALLENGES
"
472,GRMN,"Though a relatively new category, the wearable device sector is highly competitive.
"
473,GRMN,"In addition to Apple, other players in the wearable field include Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA). Microsoft recently announced a wide-ranging software update for its Microsoft Band fitness tracker. In its IPO prospectus, Fitbit also lists Samsung, Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and Misfit.
"
474,GRMN,"Vendors tripled their wearable shipments in the first quarter to 11.4 million units from just 3.8 million in Q1 2014, reports IDC.
"
475,GRMN,"While Fitbit dominates in its core fitness tracking market with an 85% share, that's not so in the overall wearable market.
"
476,GRMN,"IDC says that shipments of Fitbit wearables rose 129% to 3.9 million in the first quarter. Fitbit held the lead with a 34% market share, but that's down from 45% in the same quarter a year ago, as more competitors have entered the market.
"
477,GRMN,"Charging into the market for the No. 2 spot in Q1 was China-based Xiaomi, which also makes Apple-like smartphones. Xiaomi held a 24.6% share, IDC said. Xiaomi started shipping its Mi Band in the second half of 2014, followed by Garmin, Samsung and Jawbone.
"
478,GRMN,"""What remains to be seen is how Apple's arrival will change the landscape,"" said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas.
"
479,GRMN,"The Apple Watch will likely become the device other wearables are measured against, fairly or not, he says. But there is a difference. The Apple Watch is the most versatile wearable of the bunch, supported by its huge software ecosystem.
"
480,GRMN,"Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves expects 11 million Apple Watch unit sales this year. But ""after strong initial demand, follow-on interest in Apple Watch appears mediocre,"" he said in a research note Monday.
"
481,GRMN,"Fitbit is not a one-size-fits-all like the Apple Watch. And users could buy three Fitbit devices for the price of an Apple Watch.
"
482,GRMN,"""There are a lot of different devices on the market,"" Llamas said. ""Fitbit is not looking to be all things to all people, and the market is still very young.""
"
483,GRMN,"PROCEEDS
"
484,GRMN,"Of the $621 million expected to be raised, based on the midpoint of its offering, $218 million will go to selling shareholders, of which Fitbit will not receive any of the proceeds. Of the remaining $403 million, Fitbit expects proceeds of $373.9 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
"
485,GRMN,"It intends to use net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing activities. Fitbit said it has ""no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds.""

That's been the case since the wearable device debuted in April 2015.XSo, for the past 10 quarters, Wall Street analysts have had to estimate Apple Watch sales by parsing data from Apple's ""other products"" line item and other sources. Apple's ""other products"" category includes sales of Apple Watch as well as Beats headphones, AirPods wireless earbuds, Apple TV set-top boxes, iPod Touch media players and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.After Apple released results for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 late Thursday, at least nine Wall Street analysts tried to guesstimate how many smartwatches the company sold during the period.Based on the average of those nine estimates, Apple is believed to have sold 3.6 million Apple Watches in the September quarter.At the low end of estimates were Needham and Oppenheimer, which each estimated that Apple sold 3 million smartwatches last quarter.

The main difference between the two models is that the XE has higher-resolution video and faster frame rates. GoPro cameras are priced at $130 to $500.Compared with Garmin's first-generation product, the new cameras are smaller, have better video quality and a new form factor, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research note Monday. The new Virb cameras lack a preview screen, but have Bluetooth audio connectivity for wireless headsets and microphones.Unlike GoPro (GPRO) cameras, Garmin's Virb cameras have built-in sensors (GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope) and can connect to other Garmin products (such as a heart-rate monitor and sports watch) to allow for performance tracking. Data such as velocity, elevation and heart rate can be overlaid onto action videos of skiing, biking, skydiving and other activities.""If there's one thing missing on the new action cameras, it's 4K recording,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin upgraded to an Ambarella (AMBA) chip for the new Virb cameras, but it's not the Ambarella A9, which is used in GoPro's high-end line-up. We would expect the exclusion of 4K recording to lead to a certain amount of criticism.""Garmin likely made a trade-off to save on battery life, Anderson said. Garmin chose to include sensors rather than allow for 4K ultra HD video, he said. Garmin and GoPro cameras have comparable battery life of about two hours.By contrast, GoPro excludes such sensors from its devices because it believes that sensor data can be captured from a smartphone paired with a GoPro.Overall, the new Garmin action cameras are ""good, but not great,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin is including very little revenue from the Virb in 2015 revenue guidance, so if it gains popularity, that would be upside to the model.""Anderson rates Garmin stock as a buy with a price target of 60.

GoPro's efforts to build an audience on YouTube for videos shot with its cameras are peripheral to its core hardware business, he said.""Anybody that's trying to value GoPro on a media strategy doesn't fully understand the story and should really look at this as a hardware play,"" he said.While GoPro has successfully fended off competition from the likes of Garmin (GRMN), Panasonic, Sony (SNE) and others, that could prove more difficult going forward. Uerkwitz noted that Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is prepping a sports camera that is likely cheaper than GoPro's offerings.""This really puts the kibosh on GoPro's strategy for Asia and China in particular,"" Uerkwitz said.GoPro stock fell 6% to 41.98 on the stock market today. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company went public in June at 24 and climbed as high as 98.47 in early October before going on a major slide.Meanwhile, GoPro supplier Ambarella (AMBA), which makes video processing chips, is performing well on the stock market. Ambarella gave up Friday intraday gains as the market retreated, closing down 1.1% to 57.39. Ambarella has an IBD Relative Strength rating of 97, compared with 42 for GoPro, on a scale of 1-100. Ambarella shares rebounded this week after falling through a key support level two weeks ago. Ambarella reports earnings on Tuesday.GoPro stock lately has been hampered by the expiration of the lockup on IPO shares held by insiders. About 76 million shares, or 61% of outstanding shares, became eligible for sale last week.RELATED:How low can GoPro go? Stock continues to tankAmbarella more than just a GoPro chip supplier.

"
671,GRMN,"If the Apple Watch is a flop, it could spell doom for all smartwatches, according to CCS Insight. The research firm says that 2015 will be a ""make-or-break year"" for smartwatches, led by the launch of the Apple Watch in April.CCS Insight projects that Apple (AAPL) will account for a quarter of the wearables market in 2015, selling around 20 million Apple Watches by the end of the year.That is equivalent to about 7% of those who own a compatible iPhone at the time of the product's launch, CCS Insight said in a press release Tuesday.Smartwatches are expected to be the second-largest category of wearables this year, after fitness bands from companies such as Fitbit, Jawbone and Garmin (GRMN). Wearable cameras such as those from GoPro (GPRO) are a distant third in the wearables market.Sales of wearables will more than double from 29 million units in 2014 to 75 million in 2015 and will reach 172 million in 2018, CCS Insight says.""We expect sales of fitness and activity devices to double in 2015 to 40 million units,"" CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili said in a statement. ""We don't believe smartwatches will dent sales of fitness products in the short term.""Smart fitness devices do one thing and do it well: They measure activity with the goal of improving owners' well-being. This, combined with lower retail prices, longer battery life and a strong head start in terms of adoption, suggests that these devices will outperform smartwatches for several years to come.""Apple pulled back on the health features of the Apple Watch because of erratic sensors, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. It originally wanted to include sensors for monitoring heart activity, body temperature, blood pressure and stress levels.But those sensors didn't make the first-generation Apple Watch, which does include sensors for recording activity such as steps taken and heart rate during workouts.Apple asked Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, the sole assembler of the Apple Watch, to produce 5 million to 6 million units of the three Apple Watch models for the first quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.Half of the first-quarter production order is earmarked for the entry-level Apple Watch Sport model, which starts at $349. The midtier Apple Watch is expected to account for one-third of output, the Journal said. Apple hasn't announced pricing for its full lineup of watches.The Apple Watch will compete with smartwatches already on the market from Samsung, Sony (SNE), Lenovo's Motorola, LG Electronics and others. Many of its competitors use Google's (GOOGL) Android Wear operating system.About 720,000 Android Wear devices shipped in 2014, out of a total of 4.6 million smart wearable bands, research firm Canalys reported last week.""The current love affair affluent U.S. consumers have with the iPhone guarantees a strong start for the Apple Watch in its home market,"" CCS Insight said. ""However, if sales of the Apple Watch fail to meet expectations, it could hurt the whole smartwatch market.""Apple will employ its full marketing arsenal and the power of its brand to make the Apple Watch another must-have status symbol, CCS Insight said.RELATED:Apple car rumors rev up stock price to new highApple mega-ecosystem could lead to $1 trillion market cap.

672,GRMN,"When Mike Hicks began investing in the stock market almost 30 years ago, he practically gave up on analyzing the market itself.
"
673,GRMN,"""I was so confused by trying to interpret the market decades ago that I almost gave up trying and just focused on individual stocks, which was completely wrong,"" the retired CPA told IBD.
"
674,GRMN,"""There was so much conflicting information out there, even for a certified public accountant, for an educated person,"" Hicks said. ""If you were trying to understand the 'experts,' one says 'A' and another says the opposite of 'A.' So you came away pretty much frustrated in that exercise, feeling that nobody can call the market.""
"
675,GRMN,"That attitude turned 180 degrees when a friend showed Hicks a copy of IBD in the 1980s.
"
676,GRMN,"""I was absolutely amazed that I almost had to sit in a chair,"" he said. ""This was what I was looking for all my life.""
"
677,GRMN,"Hicks savored the screens of stocks that showed a rare combination of traits: strong volume demand and stellar fundamentals.
"
678,GRMN,"""It was like heaven,"" he said. ""Now I could rely on the financial statement information, but I had the timing of how to read the chart, and the backdrop of the all-important market status. So when you stack these advantages into your probability (of finding a winner), you start having markedly better success on a more consistent basis.""
"
679,GRMN,"The ""Ask Bill"" series — a former Investors.com feature that gave concise answers to questions submitted by readers about the stock market — also energized Hicks. He says he printed out nearly every answer and stored them in a file for frequent reference.
"
680,GRMN,"Hicks is not only a longtime IBD reader but is also host of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla., Meetup group, one of the best-attended IBD Meetups in the U.S.

"
683,GRMN,"'Please, No Rubber Carrots'
"
684,GRMN,"The group, started in October 2003, had a humble start. It had no whiteboard on which to diagram the winning patterns that great stocks form before breaking out. No computer or Internet connection either. They examined charts with transparencies, a grease pen and an overhead projector.
"
685,GRMN,"Now, Hicks and fellow staffers charge $26 a ticket. In return, the attendee gets a two-entree dinner with salad, bread, coffee and dessert, a batch of charts and other information, and several hours of education and guidance from veteran IBD readers on how to follow the market, how to build a watch list, and how to use charts.
"
686,GRMN,"""The problem all the Meetups will face is the room charge. You can handle the meal costs, because you're giving people the value of the meal, although they do complain about the quality of the food regularly,"" Hicks said with a laugh.
"
687,GRMN,"""But I always tell them, 'Look, we're getting the room for such a discount because we're buying the meal, just pretend the meal is free.' I've been acting as assistant chef and telling them what vegetables were good to prepare from (the) frozen (stage). My line to the catering manager is, 'Look, please do not give us rubber carrots.'""
"
688,GRMN,"By adding a small override to the attendance fee, Hicks was able to raise enough funds to buy a digital projector and whiteboard to enhance the learning experience. He also gives a welcome package with 64 pages of materials — mostly Investor's Corner articles — to new members.

"
690,GRMN,"A Golden Goose
"
691,GRMN,"Hicks says a turning point in his investing life came in 2003. In the years preceding that, an 80-hour workweek and a string of personal tragedies made it hard for Hicks to concentrate on the stock market.
"
692,GRMN,"""In May 2003, I knew that IBD is a golden goose, so I decided that either I had to study it, like a CPA, or I had to discredit it and become a mutual fund investor,"" he said.
"
693,GRMN,"After the grueling tax-return season, he spent a weekend that month going through the educational features on Investors.com.
"
694,GRMN,"That's when he discovered ""Ask Bill."" He learned so much from each nugget of information that he locked himself in his study from Friday night to Sunday night, asking his wife to leave meals outside the door. His computer printer ran all day, all night.

696,GRMN,"He caught the new roaring bull market by the tail.

697,GRMN,"GPS device leader Garmin (GRMN) was his first CAN SLIM stock, which he bought right at the breakout from a proper cup with handle in December 2002, two months after the major indexes bottomed. Hicks sold the stock for a 66% gain in less than six months.
"
698,GRMN,"He scored a bunch of winners that year, nailing down gains of 30% to 60% each.

I was looking at a proper new entry point, and I saw that narrow opportunity in mid-December. 1 It did not quite meet all the criteria, but you could just kind of tell (it was setting up for a new breakout). The way it acted reminded me of the Nicolas Darvas book, ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market."" You could almost see that stock crouching like a dancer crouching before he jumped.
"
702,GRMN,"When I saw that settle down over the holiday season in December, I took a pretty significant position, and then I pyramided that position up in January. Then I just sat tight.
"
703,GRMN,"I could not believe my eyes as the tens of thousands (of profits in dollars) rolled up. All my friends, of course, and my family, and wife said to me, 'Are you going to hold it until you lose it all?' It just kept going up and up, and I kept sitting with my lips pursed.
"
704,GRMN,"It was just so strong and the story was so profound; that weapon was saving lives.
"
705,GRMN,"But by April of 2004, the day I sold was a Monday. Obviously I knew the quarterly earnings would be released at 4:05 p.m. (Eastern time) that day. It had all the signs of a climax top. I said to myself, the expectations on this stock have to be so incredibly high at this point, I don't think even Taser could meet them. So I picked up the phone, called my broker and told her to sell everything. It is the first, and probably last, time that I sold a stock right at the top."" (Hicks achieved a 285% gain on the position.)
"
706,GRMN,"IBD: Which features in IBD do you discuss regularly at the Meetup?
"
707,GRMN,"Hicks: What I use for the printouts every month for the Meetup is The Big Picture. It does a number of things, especially for new people, but I also use it personally to interpret the market for me, even after all these years.
"
708,GRMN,"Not only does it explain the market, but it gives you every day a list of the leading stocks that were up or down in big volume. So you can use that every day to identify those quality stocks according to CAN SLIM principles. And the text usually discusses some of those stocks.
"
709,GRMN,"I think a lot of people do not recognize the immense value of what they're looking at on that page. I'm not aware of any other publication that puts on the front page a market call every day, and tells you to the exact day that a new rally starts. And they call the exact day that they think it stops. I think that's an incredible thing to put on the front page of a major financial publication.
"
710,GRMN,"IBD: Do you encounter some attendees who mix the rules of CAN SLIM with other systems or their own?
"
711,GRMN,"Hicks: Yes, we've had quite a few, actually. I try not to give my opinion but Bill O'Neil's opinion, and what he advocates in all his materials.

""This was what I was looking for all my life.""Hicks savored the screens of stocks that showed a rare combination of traits: strong volume demand and stellar fundamentals.""It was like heaven,"" he said. ""Now I could rely on the financial statement information, but I had the timing of how to read the chart, and the backdrop of the all-important market status. So when you stack these advantages into your probability (of finding a winner), you start having markedly better success on a more consistent basis.""The ""Ask Bill"" series — a former Investors.com feature that gave concise answers to questions submitted by readers about the stock market — also energized Hicks. He says he printed out nearly every answer and stored them in a file for frequent reference.Hicks is not only a longtime IBD reader but is also host of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla., Meetup group, one of the best-attended IBD Meetups in the U.S.At the latest monthly gathering on May 25, 53 people showed up, a monthly record and all the more impressive considering that snowbirds from the Northeast had already headed back up the coast.Today, Hicks and other readers are attending the inaugural IBD Meetup Leaders Summit, hosted by the Naperville, Ill., Meetup group. Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, was slated to give a talk to the group Friday evening ahead of a Level II IBD Workshop on Saturday.'Please, No Rubber Carrots'The group, started in October 2003, had a humble start. It had no whiteboard on which to diagram the winning patterns that great stocks form before breaking out. No computer or Internet connection either. They examined charts with transparencies, a grease pen and an overhead projector.Now, Hicks and fellow staffers charge $26 a ticket. In return, the attendee gets a two-entree dinner with salad, bread, coffee and dessert, a batch of charts and other information, and several hours of education and guidance from veteran IBD readers on how to follow the market, how to build a watch list, and how to use charts.""The problem all the Meetups will face is the room charge. You can handle the meal costs, because you're giving people the value of the meal, although they do complain about the quality of the food regularly,"" Hicks said with a laugh.""But I always tell them, 'Look, we're getting the room for such a discount because we're buying the meal, just pretend the meal is free.' I've been acting as assistant chef and telling them what vegetables were good to prepare from (the) frozen (stage). My line to the catering manager is, 'Look, please do not give us rubber carrots.'""By adding a small override to the attendance fee, Hicks was able to raise enough funds to buy a digital projector and whiteboard to enhance the learning experience. He also gives a welcome package with 64 pages of materials — mostly Investor's Corner articles — to new members.""We had borrowed a number of techniques from the (Meetup) folks in Chicago,"" he said.A Golden GooseHicks says a turning point in his investing life came in 2003. In the years preceding that, an 80-hour workweek and a string of personal tragedies made it hard for Hicks to concentrate on the stock market.""In May 2003, I knew that IBD is a golden goose, so I decided that either I had to study it, like a CPA, or I had to discredit it and become a mutual fund investor,"" he said.After the grueling tax-return season, he spent a weekend that month going through the educational features on Investors.com.That's when he discovered ""Ask Bill."" He learned so much from each nugget of information that he locked himself in his study from Friday night to Sunday night, asking his wife to leave meals outside the door. His computer printer ran all day, all night.""It was an epiphany. I didn't know how the printer did not burn out,"" he said.He caught the new roaring bull market by the tail.GPS device leader Garmin (GRMN) was his first CAN SLIM stock, which he bought right at the breakout from a proper cup with handle in December 2002, two months after the major indexes bottomed. Hicks sold the stock for a 66% gain in less than six months.He scored a bunch of winners that year, nailing down gains of 30% to 60% each.Then came his all-time portfolio champ, stun gun maker Taser International (TASR).IBD: You scored a 100% gain the first time you bought Taser in 2003. Why did you buy it again?Hicks: ""I was sorry I sold it the first time. I was looking at a proper new entry point, and I saw that narrow opportunity in mid-December. 1 It did not quite meet all the criteria, but you could just kind of tell (it was setting up for a new breakout). The way it acted reminded me of the Nicolas Darvas book, ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market."" You could almost see that stock crouching like a dancer crouching before he jumped.When I saw that settle down over the holiday season in December, I took a pretty significant position, and then I pyramided that position up in January. Then I just sat tight.I could not believe my eyes as the tens of thousands (of profits in dollars) rolled up. All my friends, of course, and my family, and wife said to me, 'Are you going to hold it until you lose it all?' It just kept going up and up, and I kept sitting with my lips pursed.It was just so strong and the story was so profound; that weapon was saving lives.But by April of 2004, the day I sold was a Monday. Obviously I knew the quarterly earnings would be released at 4:05 p.m. (Eastern time) that day. It had all the signs of a climax top. I said to myself, the expectations on this stock have to be so incredibly high at this point, I don't think even Taser could meet them. So I picked up the phone, called my broker and told her to sell everything. It is the first, and probably last, time that I sold a stock right at the top."" (Hicks achieved a 285% gain on the position.)IBD: Which features in IBD do you discuss regularly at the Meetup?Hicks: What I use for the printouts every month for the Meetup is The Big Picture. It does a number of things, especially for new people, but I also use it personally to interpret the market for me, even after all these years.Not only does it explain the market, but it gives you every day a list of the leading stocks that were up or down in big volume. So you can use that every day to identify those quality stocks according to CAN SLIM principles. And the text usually discusses some of those stocks.I think a lot of people do not recognize the immense value of what they're looking at on that page. I'm not aware of any other publication that puts on the front page a market call every day, and tells you to the exact day that a new rally starts. And they call the exact day that they think it stops. I think that's an incredible thing to put on the front page of a major financial publication.IBD: Do you encounter some attendees who mix the rules of CAN SLIM with other systems or their own?Hicks: Yes, we've had quite a few, actually. I try not to give my opinion but Bill O'Neil's opinion, and what he advocates in all his materials. Bill has studied all these methodologies as well as charting methodologies like candlesticks, for example ... and he's not apologetic to say matter-of-factly that he's looked at these and invalidated them, and that none of these are superior to a simple price and volume chart.

But while Xiaomi sells mostly low-cost fitness bands, Apple sells premium smartwatches branded as Apple Watch.Apple's wearables shipments rose 64% year over year in the first quarter, while Xiaomi's dipped 3.3%.

For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The previous leader in the wearables market, Fitbit (FIT), has fallen into third place. While the San Francisco-based company believes there is still a market for fitness trackers, it is shifting its resources to develop a true smartwatch, which it expects to release later in 2017.Fitbit had 12.3% share of the wearables market in the first quarter, with 3 million unit shipments. Its shipments fell 37.7% year over year.Samsung posted the fastest growth among the top five vendors. It increased its wearable shipments by 90.8% to 1.4 million units in the first quarter.

For better stocks to consider, check out the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson believes the market for activity trackers is saturated.

Garmin also makes navigation gear for automotive, aviation, marine and outdoor markets.""Garmin's report reinforced our view that the basic tracker market is saturated; we think Fitbit's exposure remains a significant headwind at 60% to 70% of total revenue and think units are tracking to roughly 30% year-over-year declines,"" Erickson said in a report. He rates Fitbit stock as sector weight with a fair value of 6.Fitbit is expected to launch a smartwatch later this year that will put it into direct competition with Apple's (AAPL) device known as the Apple Watch.""Fitbit needs innovation in software and hardware to drive increased and more consistent engagement among its registered users,"" Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a report. ""Fitbit will launch a smartwatch in second-half 2017 to complement its current Blaze ($199.95) and Surge ($249.95) products. We believe the smartwatch will be priced in the $250-$300 range to minimize cannibalization on Blaze and Surge. At these prices, if we are accurate, Fitbit's smartwatch would directly compete in a similar price category to the $269 Series 1 and $369 Series 2 Apple Watches.""Apple, the leader in the smartwatch market, said its Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year-over-year in the March quarter.

779,GRMN,"Two years after Apple (AAPL) started selling its Apple Watch, the company has yet to disclose how many units of the smartwatch it has sold.That has created a guessing game on Wall Street as analysts try to divine sales numbers from Apple's quarterly financial results.Apple lumps Apple Watch sales in its ""Other Products"" category, which includes Beats headphones, iPod music players, Apple TV set-top boxes and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. Trying to distinguish Apple Watch sales from Other Products revenue got even harder with Apple's fiscal second-quarter results, out late Tuesday. That's because the period that ended April 1 included the first full quarter of sales of Apple's wireless earbuds called AirPods, which it has touted as a hit product.Revenue from Apple's Other Products segment rose 31% year over year to $2.87 billion in the quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple Watch sales ""nearly doubled year over year"" during that period.""We're really proud of the growth of the business,"" Cook said on a conference call with analysts. ""The watch units more than doubled in six of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a nonholiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it.""Still, how many watches did Apple sell last quarter?Of the financial analysts who cover Apple, 11 made estimates about Apple Watch sales for the fiscal second quarter. The consensus estimate of those analysts was 2.83 million. Canaccord Genuity had the highest estimate at 4 million units and UBS had the lowest at 1.825 million.Of the 10 analysts who made Apple Watch sales targets for the current third quarter, the consensus estimate was 2.73 million units.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 83, meaning it has outperformed 83% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple Watch competes mostly with sports and fitness watches from Garmin (GRMN) and Fitbit (FIT).On Wednesday, Garmin reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended April 1. Fitbit is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the close Wednesday.Garmin earned 52 cents a share excluding items, up 7% year over year, on sales of $639 million, up 2%, in the first quarter. Analysts were modeling for 45 cents a share on sales of $629 million.

"
780,GRMN,"Momentum in the wearables space is building as consumers continue to shift from watches to wearables, says one analyst, with Apple (AAPL), Garmin (GRMN), Fossil (FOSL) and Fitbit (FIT) among those looking to benefit.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Edward Yruma in a research note Friday said he believes that technology and apparel, including accessories, ""continue to converge and wearables are positioned to serve as an early barometer of this trend.""He believes the addition of new features on the Apple Watch — specifically a global positioning system that is designed specifically for that product, along with waterproofing — are driving volume at the high end. Meanwhile, the reduction in price for the Apple Watch Series 1 is enticing a broader audience to try the product.""While we have seen little to suggest a pending inflection in growth rates, the category seems to be demonstrating steady progress for Apple, which suggests the bulk of the opportunity may still be in the future,"" Yruma wrote.IDC, in a report last month, said the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 devices ""proved to be a magnificent success for the company"" in the fourth quarter. Apple has said the fourth quarter was its best for the Apple Watch in both units shipped and revenue amid strong holiday demand.Apple stock slipped 0.2% to close at 143.34 on the stock market today. It's trading near a record high of 145.46 set on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is an IBD Leaderboard stock and is holding nicely above a 141.12 four-weeks-tight add-on entry. The gain has been limited so far amid a market uptrend still under pressure. The megacap tech has enjoyed a surprisingly strong run since it rallied past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 6-9.Traditional watchmakers focusing on wearables are a particular threat to Fitbit but less so for Garmin, Yruma wrote. He believes traditional watch brands ""can easily bring 'proprietary technology' for basic tracking and connectivity, ""making those traditional watch brands increasingly competitive vs. fitness-centric brands like Fitbit and Garmin,"" Yruma said. But Garmin ""is significantly better insulated vs. Fitbit, given that fitness trackers are likely no more than 10% of revenue.""He believes Fossil continues to move aggressively to develop a scalable wearables platform. As a volume producer of watches, Fossil should have ""an advantage vs. traditional watch companies.""Total wearables shipments rose 17% to a record high 33.9 million units in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. For the full year, wearables shipments rose 25% to 102.4 million units. Apple was the third-largest maker of wearable devices in the December quarter, behind Fitbit and China's Xiaomi, with 13.6% market share by unit shipments.RELATED:Apple Gets Price-Target Hike On Expectations For Huge iPhone 8 Launch

876,GRMN,"As Apple prepares to enter the wearable device market, it faces big hurdles to consumer adoption of such devices.A recent survey of consumers in the U.S. and U.K. by CCS Insight revealed that awareness of wearable devices is high, but ownership is low. Many consumers indicated that they didn't see the need for a smartwatch or were put off by high prices.The CCS survey found that 75% of respondents are aware of smartwatches and fitness bands. Last year, 63% of respondents knew about smartwatches and 54% knew about fitness bands.This year's survey showed that 6% own and use a fitness tracker and 7% own but no longer use one. The same survey showed that 3% own and use a smartwatch and 2% own but no longer use one.On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to unveil a smartwatch-fitness band, which has been dubbed the iWatch or iBand. Most analysts don't expect the device to hit the market until late this year or early next.Many people surveyed by CCS Insight said that they hadn't bought a smartwatch because they didn't see the value in it and the prices were too high.As for fitness bands, a large number of respondents indicated that measuring sporting activity was of less interest than tracking health and well-being factors such as sleep and heart rate.The consumer electronics industry needs to do a better job of educating consumers about the benefits of wearable devices, CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili said in a statement.Consumers also indicated a desire for a hybrid smartwatch-fitness band, CCS reported. It's very likely that the smartwatch market will cannibalize the fitness band market, the research firm said.Shipments of smart wearables are expected to grow from 9.7 million units in 2013 to 135 million in 2018, CCS Insight said in a separate report. It forecasts shipments of 22 million wearable devices this year.CCS predicts that wrist-worn devices will account for 87% of wearables shipped in 2018 — comprising 68 million smartwatches and 50 million smart bands with no screen or with a minimal, one-line display.The top two makers of fitness bands are Fitbit and Jawbone, with new entrant Garmin (GRMN) chasing third place, research firm Canalys reported last month.Samsung leads the smartwatch market with its Gear devices, followed by Pebble and Sony (SNE), Canalys said.The smartwatch market has been ramping up lately with new devices from Asus, LG Electronics and Motorola, all of which use Google's (GOOGL) Android Wear operating system.RELATED:Round smartwatches a trend with LG, Motorola, Samsung on board .

Meanwhile, wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) appeared to calm investors with Q4 results that came within its lowered guidance range.At least seven Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on HP stock after the company's Q1 report late Wednesday. But of those seven, five reiterated neutral or equivalent ratings on the stock. Two were bullish: FBN Securities and Morgan Stanley.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi upgraded HP stock to outperform from sector perform and raised his price target to 19 from 15. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight rating on HP stock and upped her price target to 19 from 16.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 67, meaning it has outperformed 67% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 5 out of 14 stocks in IBD's Computer-Hardware and Peripherals industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.HP broke out of a nine-week cup base with a buy point of 16.35 on Thursday. Shares of the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company rose as much as 9.9% to a two-year high of 17.80 in intraday trading on the stock market today. HP stock closed the session at 17.60, up 8.6%.Seyrafi turned positive on HP because of the company's solid execution and ""excellent free cash flow metrics."" HP PC sales are benefiting from innovative products and its printer supplies business is showing signs of stabilization, he said in his research report.Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said HP's PC business is benefiting from consolidation in the market, which has left three big vendors: Lenovo, HP and Dell Technologies (DVMT). HP also was smart to shift to premium Windows PCs in the consumer and commercial markets, he said in a report.Fitbit stock rose on Thursday after its December quarter report was better than feared. Fitbit shares rose 3.2% to 6.07 Thursday.Most analysts maintained a cautious tone on the stock, which has been hammered by slowing sales of wearable fitness devices.Cowen analyst John Kernan reiterated his market perform rating on Fitbit, but cut his price target to 7 from 9.""Guidance for 2017 implies weak sales, down 26% year over year at the midpoint, additional gross margin contraction and expense management,"" Kernan said.While Fitbit leads the fitness tracker market, it has been ceding share to Garmin (GRMN) and other brands, he said in a report.On Wednesday, Garmin reported better-than-expected Q4 results thanks to strong wearable device sales.Fitbit management is focused on entering the smartwatch market now, leveraging its learnings from the Fitbit Blaze fitness watch and its recent acquisitions, including Pebble. But the company will face tough competition from Apple (AAPL) and others in the smartwatch business, Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a report. She rates Fitbit stock as underweight with a price target of 5.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

949,GRMN,"A rapid rise in the use of touch-screens for tablet computers, smartphones and other gear has translated into heavy demand for chips that can power the screens.
"
950,GRMN,"Among the beneficiaries is Cypress Semiconductor (CY). The company supplies touch-screen chips and other high-performance, mixed-signal, programmable solutions to a variety of end markets.
"
951,GRMN,"In years past, Cypress was best known for its SRAM chips that help computers perform core memory functions.
"
952,GRMN,"But thanks to a series of design wins, the company's touch-screen gear, including its TrueTouch family of products, has become the biggest revenue generator.
"
953,GRMN,"During a conference call with analysts following Cypress' first-quarter earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Brad Buss said TrueTouch became the company's ""largest individual product family"" during the quarter.
"
954,GRMN,"""It was bigger than our synchronous SRAM business, which has been the 'Big Daddy' for quite a few years,"" Buss said. ""Design activity continues to be really strong.""
"
955,GRMN,"The rapid ascent of Cypress' TrueTouch business is the direct result of shifts in consumer trends, analysts say. That shift includes buying fewer PCs and more tablet computers and smartphones.
"
956,GRMN,"""Cypress' products are used in a variety of areas, but the TrueTouch used in the booming tablet market as well as smartphones is the hottest source of growth,"" analyst Bill Wilton recently noted in a report for Zacks.com.
"
957,GRMN,"Many Uses
"
958,GRMN,"In addition to smartphones and tablets, touch-screens are becoming a bigger presence in cameras, IP phones, automotive dashboards, e-books and GPS devices.
"
959,GRMN,"Cypress supplies touch-screen chips for use in Research in Motion's (RIMM) PlayBook as well as Samsung Electronics' Galaxy series of devices.
"
960,GRMN,"Rising demand for touch-screen chips has translated into a big financial rebound for Cypress.
"
961,GRMN,"In 2010, the company grew sales 31% year-over-year, ending a run of three straight years of lower sales. Annual earnings rose more than ninefold in 2010 after declining 84% the prior year.
"
962,GRMN,"Cypress shares touched a record high of 23.95 on May 31.
"
963,GRMN,"The outlook for 2011 looks equally promising as Cypress looks to take advantage of a market with very little competition or pricing pressure.
"
964,GRMN,"The company competes with Atmel (ATML) and Synaptics (SYNA) in the touch-screen market. Like Cypress, both of those companies have notched robust financial returns over the last several quarters, though analysts expect Synaptics to face lower sales and earnings beginning this quarter.
"
965,GRMN,"In contrast, analysts see Cypress continuing to log double-digit profit and revenue gains well into next year even as some experts worry that the overall chip market is headed for a down cycle.
"
966,GRMN,"""Whereas SRAM was a drag on Cypress exiting the 2001-02 down cycle, we expect Cypress' proprietary products (including TrueTouch) to drive a steeper revenue recovery in coming quarters,"" Citigroup analyst Glen Yeung noted in a report.

967,GRMN,"While much of the optimism stems from the smartphone sector, Cypress officials also have pointed to strength in other end markets.
"
968,GRMN,"During the Q1 conference call, Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers conceded that cell phones are the ""big-volume, much sought-after wins."" But, he added, Cypress is also focusing on wins in digital cameras, auto dashboards, GPS devices, printers, e-books and tablets.
"
969,GRMN,"""We're pushing all of those — not just cell phones,"" Rodgers said.
"
970,GRMN,"The company's design wins last quarter included deals with GPS makers Garmin (GRMN) and TomTom, Cisco's (CSCO) IP phone division, Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) printer division and Sony's camera unit.
"
971,GRMN,"Cypress logged Q1 revenue of $233.2 million. That was up 15% from the prior year and above estimates for $228.9 million. Earnings climbed 41% to 24 cents a share, a penny above views. It was Cypress' ninth straight earnings beat.
"
972,GRMN,"Much of the top-line growth came from the TrueTouch unit. Its revenue climbed nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter and more than 200% year-over-year.
"
973,GRMN,"""Cypress' TrueTouch family of touch-screen controllers continues to gain traction with handset, tablet, and e-reader manufacturers,"" Yeung noted.
"
974,GRMN,"Growth Expectations
"
975,GRMN,"Cypress expects the touch-screen chip segment to more than double in size by the end of the year.
"
976,GRMN,"""There has been very strong growth in handsets, and we also are starting to see nice contributions in our large-screen formats,"" CFO Buss said during the conference call.
"
977,GRMN,"In terms of risks, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely noted in a report that Cypress' gross margins fell 70 basis points sequentially, to 55.2% from 55.9%, during the 2010 fourth quarter.
"
978,GRMN,"""That was below our estimate of 56.0% due to lower utilization rates,"" Danely wrote. ""We expect 2Q11 gross margins to remain roughly flat quarter-over-quarter at 55.0% due to higher utilization offset by higher costs.""
"
979,GRMN,"Cypress is due to report second-quarter earnings on July 21. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect profit of 30 cents a share, up from 24 cents a year earlier. Full-year profit should rise 35% this year and 17% in 2012.A rapid rise in the use of touch-screens for tablet computers, smartphones and other gear has translated into heavy demand for chips that can power the screens.Among the beneficiaries is Cypress Semiconductor (CY). The company supplies touch-screen chips and other high-performance, mixed-signal, programmable solutions to a variety of end markets.In years past, Cypress was best known for its SRAM chips that help computers perform core memory functions.But thanks to a series of design wins, the company's touch-screen gear, including its TrueTouch family of products, has become the biggest revenue generator.During a conference call with analysts following Cypress' first-quarter earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Brad Buss said TrueTouch became the company's ""largest individual product family"" during the quarter.""It was bigger than our synchronous SRAM business, which has been the 'Big Daddy' for quite a few years,"" Buss said. ""Design activity continues to be really strong.""The rapid ascent of Cypress' TrueTouch business is the direct result of shifts in consumer trends, analysts say. That shift includes buying fewer PCs and more tablet computers and smartphones.""Cypress' products are used in a variety of areas, but the TrueTouch used in the booming tablet market as well as smartphones is the hottest source of growth,"" analyst Bill Wilton recently noted in a report for Zacks.com.Many UsesIn addition to smartphones and tablets, touch-screens are becoming a bigger presence in cameras, IP phones, automotive dashboards, e-books and GPS devices.Cypress supplies touch-screen chips for use in Research in Motion's (RIMM) PlayBook as well as Samsung Electronics' Galaxy series of devices.Rising demand for touch-screen chips has translated into a big financial rebound for Cypress.In 2010, the company grew sales 31% year-over-year, ending a run of three straight years of lower sales. Annual earnings rose more than ninefold in 2010 after declining 84% the prior year.Cypress shares touched a record high of 23.95 on May 31.The outlook for 2011 looks equally promising as Cypress looks to take advantage of a market with very little competition or pricing pressure.The company competes with Atmel (ATML) and Synaptics (SYNA) in the touch-screen market. Like Cypress, both of those companies have notched robust financial returns over the last several quarters, though analysts expect Synaptics to face lower sales and earnings beginning this quarter.In contrast, analysts see Cypress continuing to log double-digit profit and revenue gains well into next year even as some experts worry that the overall chip market is headed for a down cycle.""Whereas SRAM was a drag on Cypress exiting the 2001-02 down cycle, we expect Cypress' proprietary products (including TrueTouch) to drive a steeper revenue recovery in coming quarters,"" Citigroup analyst Glen Yeung noted in a report.While much of the optimism stems from the smartphone sector, Cypress officials also have pointed to strength in other end markets.During the Q1 conference call, Chief Executive T.J.

1137,GRMN,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) saw its stock fall for the second day in a row after it received another round of negative analyst reports following its fourth-quarter warning.Fitbit stock ended regular trading down 0.8% to 6.01 on the stock market today. It was trading just above its all-time low of 5.90, reached Monday.Fitbit fell 16% on Monday after it preannounced dismal holiday-quarter results.The San Francisco-based company said it expects Q4 sales of $572 million to $580 million, compared with its previously announced guidance range of $725 million to $750 million. Fitbit now expects to post a loss in the December quarter of 51 to 56 cents a share minus items, compared with its previous target of a profit of 14 to 18 cents on a non-GAAP basis.IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit ranks No. 9 out of 10 stocks in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Fitbit will report its final Q4 numbers on Feb. 22.Fitbit on Monday also drastically lowered expectations for 2017. It expects a full-year loss of 22 to 44 cents a share on revenue of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.Wall Street was modeling Fitbit to earn 64 cents a share ex items on sales of $2.38 billion in 2017.Citi analyst Stanley Kovler downgraded Fitbit to sell from neutral and set a price target of 5.Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor grouped Fitbit with action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) and said both stocks should be ""assiduously avoided in 2017 as both have further to fall"" before they become acquisition targets.""Users appear to be becoming bored with fitness tracking,"" Windsor said in a research report Tuesday. Activity trackers like those made by Fitbit have been ""a solution looking for a problem,"" he said.Fitbit devices have basic sensors for tracking recreational health and haven't proven to be useful enough for most consumers, Windsor said.The company claims to have 23.2 million active users, but there are many devices gathering dust in drawers, he said. Fitbit needs to innovate to avoid commoditization in the category from low-cost rivals. It needs new sensors, such as ones for measuring blood pressure or blood sugar, Windsor said.Fitbit's preannouncement ""may have ruined any investor confidence that was left"" in the company, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report. He said his outperform rating is under review.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said the ""most alarming"" news in the report is that Fitbit is now burning cash as its free cash flow has turned negative. She rates Fitbit as underweight.With the market for fitness trackers saturated, Fitbit is trying to move into smartwatches, a category where it trails Apple (AAPL) and Garmin (GRMN).""Entry into smart/running watches obviously could help, but we question whether Fitbit's brand can pivot into these adjacent markets where allegiance is much more strongly tied to brands like Garmin, Suunto and Polar for fitness, and Apple or Samsung for smartwatches,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said in a report. He rates the stock as sector weight.RELATED:Fitbit Slashes Expectations For Q4, Year Ahead; Shifts To Smartwatches
"
1138,GRMN,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) called in sick on Monday, revealing worse-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, a surprise loss and a round of layoffs to cut costs.Fitbit stock tumbled to an all-time low of 5.97 on the stock market today and only recovered a small amount of that by the closing bell. Fitbit ended trading down 16% to 6.06.The San Francisco-based company said it expects Q4 sales of $572 million to $580 million, compared with its previously announced guidance range of $725 million to $750 million.Fitbit also expects to post a loss of 51 to 56 cents a share minus items, compared with its previous target of a profit of 14 to 18 cents on a non-GAAP basis.IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit stock has a near bottom-of-the-barrel IBD Composite Rating of 7, meaning it has been outperformed by 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks last out of 10 stocks in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Fitbit to earn 17 cents a share excluding items on sales of $736 million in Q4.""Fourth-quarter results are expected to be below our prior guidance range; however, we are confident this performance is not reflective of the value of our brand, market-leading platform, and company's long-term potential,"" Fitbit CEO James Park said in a statement. ""While we have experienced softer-than-expected holiday demand for trackers in our most mature markets, especially during Black Friday, we have continued to grow rapidly in select markets like EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), where revenue grew 58% during the fourth quarter.""Park called the company's Q4 results ""a temporary slowdown and transition period."" He said the company will be placing a greater emphasis now on smartwatches.Fitbit will report its final Q4 numbers on Feb. 22.Fitbit announced a reorganization of its business to lower operating expenses. It will cut about 110 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce.""We believe the evolving wearables market continues to present growth opportunities for us that we will capitalize on by investing in our core product offerings, while expanding into the smartwatch category to diversify revenue and capture share of the over $10 billion global smartwatch market,"" Park said.

Instead, Amazon pointed to strong sales of a fitness band and smartwatch from rival Garmin (GRMN).Other top-selling tech products on Amazon.com over the holiday season included Amazon's own Echo smart speakers, Samsung TVs, and Nintendo (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon"" video games.Meanwhile, action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) received some coal in its stocking from Piper Jaffray on Tuesday.Piper analyst Erinn Murphy reiterated her underweight rating on GoPro stock after signs of a disappointing holiday sales period.

Fitbit had a small and declining share of the smartwatch market, she said.Fitbit did not buy Pebble's hardware business. Pebble is shutting down and liquidating its current inventory of smartwatches.Fitbit shares have been hit by slowing demand for activity trackers, competition from smartwatches, and concerns that wearable fitness devices might be a fad.

1143,GRMN,"The holidays were happy ones for Amazon.com (AMZN), which says that its very own hardware products, led by the Echo Dot, were its best-selling products.Following the Echo Dot, Amazon said the best-selling products over the holiday season overall were the Fire TV Stick, the Fire Tablet and the Amazon Echo.Amazon says it has sold ""millions"" of the Echo Dot since its introduction. The Echo Dot, which costs $49.99, is the low-end version of the Amazon Echo, which sells for $179.99. The Echo, including Dot, is a voice activated, Wi-Fi-connected smart speaker linked to the cloud. With the voice of the artificially intelligent Alexa, Echo serves up music, news, traffic and weather, plays games, answers questions and does much more.Amazon stock was up 1.5% near 772 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, just below its 50-day moving average.The Amazon Echo, a similar device by the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL) and another being developed by Microsoft (MSFT) are expected to play a key role in the smart home. Alphabet recently followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home, which sells for $129. Google Home is a voice-activated speaker powered by Google Allo, its artificially intelligent assistant.IBD'S TAKE: The battle to provide the best digital butler for homes is one that Amazon and other tech leaders will be fighting for years. These in-home devices with artificial intelligence and language processing skills could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.Microsoft has yet to introduce a similar device for the home, but it has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. This is also true of Apple with its Siri platform and Facebook (FB) with its Messenger platform.Microsoft last week gave a sneak peak at a new hardware device that looks similar to Echo. The device has the Harman (HAR) label but is voice-controlled through Cortana.Among other top-selling products on Amazon over the holiday sales period were memory cards from Western Digital (WDC)-owned SanDisk, wearable technology from Garmin (GRMN), Samsung TVs, Levi's and Spalding basketballs.Online shoppers swarmed to Amazon this holiday season. The the e-commerce leader has gained share vs. Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL).Amazon said more than 72% of Amazon customers worldwide shopped using a mobile device this holiday.RELATED:Amazon Introduces 'Amazon Go' Retail Stores, No Checkout, No LinesAmazon Set To Disrupt Retailers In Apparel, Groceries, ServicesApple, Microsoft, Alphabet Are Kings Of Cash As Tech Sector Rules

1144,GRMN,"Apple Watch sales to consumers hit record levels in the first week of holiday shopping, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook told Reuters, countering new data that said the tech titan's wearables sales have crashed.Cook said Apple Watch sell-through rate, which measures how many units are actually sold to consumers vs. on sent to retailers, rose to a record level. But Cook didn't offer any specific figures.Responding to a Reuters email, Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high.""Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history,"" Cook told Reuters.Cook's response followed a Monday IDC report that Apple Watch shipments fell 71% in Q3 vs. a year earlier, even as wearables overall rose 3.1%. Fitness tracker Fitbit (FIT) expanded its lead as No. 1 in wearables, while No. 5 Samsung showed the strongest growth. China's Xiaomi and Garmin (GRMN) are No. 2 and No. 3 in wearables.Apple sales likely plunged in part as consumers awaited the Apple Watch 2. Cook's claimed holiday sales spike supports that argument. That doesn't necessarily ease concerns about the long-term future for the Apple Watch or smartwatches generally.Shares of Apple rose 0.7% to 109.92 just before the closing bell on the stock market today. The stock fell 0.7% to 109.10 on Monday, continuing to trade below its 50-day moving average.Fitbit, which recently reported weak quarterly results and a grim holiday forecast, fell 0.5% to 7.99 intraday.

""Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme.""Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five (all but Apple) offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.""IBD'S TAKE: Wearables aren't a hot sector, but there always are some fields doing well. And to find them, IBD's Industry Snapshot is one place to regularly check.IDC said fitness bands and basic wearables accounted for 85% of the market and jumped by double digits.Total shipments rose to 23 million from 22.3 million in Q3 2015, the firm said. The wearables rise outpaced smartphones, which saw just a 1% rise in Q3 shipments, IDC said in October.For Q3, Apple Watch shipments skidded to 1.1 million, IDC said, hurt by the late-quarter release (mid-September) of its second-generation watches. IDC also criticized what it called the Apple Watch's ""unintuitive user interface."" It says that problem's been addressed with the new Watch, but said ""Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.""Fitbit saw an 11% rise in Q3 shipments, to 5.3 million, with its market share rising to 23% from 21.4%. China's Xiaomi is No. 2, but despite a 4% Q3 rise, its overall share barely rose to 16.5% from 16.4%.No. 3 Garmin (GRMN) had a 12.2% Q3 increase, with its market share up to 5.7% from 5.3%.Next comes Apple, though its market share tumbled to just 4.9%, from 17.5% in Q3 2015.No. 5 Samsung saw its shipments nearly double to 1 million, and its share rose to 4.5% from 2.5%. The other vendors combined recorded a 26.1% rise in Q3 shipments, as the market fragmented.""Smart wearables have been down in recent quarters, but clearly not out,"" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said in the release. ""As user tastes change, so will their needs.

Action camera maker GoPro gave a weak holiday outlook and days later recalled its just-launched Karma drone.Fitbit also has been struggling, reporting a deeper-than-expected earnings decline and a weak holiday outlook on Nov. 2. Fitbit shares crashed 34% the next day to an all-time low.Fitbit shares haven't recovered much since then. Shares ended trading up 0.7% to 8.42 on the stock market today.The Apple Watch, including the all-new Apple Watch 2, could be one problem for Fitbit. Samsung, Lenovo, Garmin (GRMN) and many others have entered the market. Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google will release two smartwatches in Q1 and has its Android Wear software.But there are also signs that smartwatch sales have waned as initial interest tapers off, though the shipment drop may reflect product cycles.

""Fitbit needs to crack into the specialty channel, not to necessarily drive volume, but to drive consumer street credit as more than a tracker.""Fitbit shares tumbled after the San Francisco-based company on Nov. 2 posted disappointing third-quarter results and badly missed Wall Street's targets for the December quarter.On Wednesday, video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced that it has partnered with Fitbit to give players of ""NBA 2K17"" in-game rewards for healthy activity tracked by Fitbit devices.Players who achieve 10,000 steps in a day tracked with their Fitbit device will receive a temporary attribute boost to their MyPlayer in ""NBA 2K17,"" enhancing their in-game performance on the court.It's not the first tie-up between a wearables maker and a video game company.In September, Apple (AAPL) announced that it would bring ""Pokemon Go"" to the Apple Watch.

1203,GRMN,"LAS VEGAS — The consumer markets for 3D printers and wearable devices are poised for growth — and thus are among fields taking center stage at this week's Consumer Electronics Show.3D printers' growth is thanks to cheaper hardware, simpler systems and an increasing number of practical uses for the devices. At least, that's the word from 3D printer makers at CES.Avi Reichental, chief executive of 3D Systems (DDD), said the key to spreading adoption of 3D printers to consumers is to make the machines more inviting. Today they're used mostly by engineers and other geeks, while typical consumers are ""intimidated by the complexity and the immaturity of some of this technology,"" he said in a speech at CES on Wednesday.At the show, 3D Systems unveiled its first sub-$1,000 printer, the Cube 3, which can make objects up to 6 inches high, wide and deep. It also added a more capable 3D printer, the CubePro, which costs $5,000 and has a print volume equal to the size of a regulation basketball.Creators also are making more fun and useful items with their printers. 3D printers make three-dimensional objects out of plastic and other materials using computer-aided design software.""In the next evolution (of 3D printers), the universe doesn't need any more thingees and tchotchkes,"" he said. ""The universe needs real functionality.""At the annual tech conference, which is expected to draw some 150,000 visitors, 3D Systems also introduced a pottery and ceramics printer and two food printers for making things like sugar cake toppers and other edible confections.3D Systems also unveiled a 3D scanner attachment for Apple 's (AAPL) iPad called the iSense, which lets users do ""physical photography."" The iSense is priced at $499 and will be available in Q2.Rival 3D printer maker MakerBot used CES for a host of announcements as well. MakerBot, a unit of Stratasys (SSYS), announced three new 3D printers at the show.MakerBot CEO Bre Prettis said the company's fifth-generation printers mark ""a new beginning"" for the firm. The new machines include an easy-to-use consumer model that is to 3D printing what point-and-shoot cameras are to photography, he said. That model, the MakerBot Replicator Mini printer, is expected to cost $1,375 when it becomes available in the spring, he said.Plus, the Brooklyn-based company debuted a professional model that costs $2,899 and a large-format industrial printer that goes for $6,499.Like 3D Systems, MakerBot also showed off new software tools and ready-to-print 3D models.Also at the show, Taiwan-based XYZprinting introduced a low-cost consumer 3D printer, da Vinci 1.0, which is set to retail for $499 when it hits the market in March.Better Living Through TechWearable devices for measuring and tracking personal health and fitness are all the rage at CES.Scores of companies exhibited at the show with fitness bands, brooches and other wearable items designed to measure such things as motion and heart rate. The products are part of the larger category of smart wearable items that include Internet-connected headsets and watches.Mio Global of Vancouver introduced a wristband designed to monitor your heart rate as accurately as a chest strap. It will be available in March for $99.The Mio Link is targeted at athletes and fitness buffs who want to improve their conditioning through heart rate training, says Jenn Fox, Mio channel marketing manager. The device provides real-time feedback through colored lights to let users know if they're exercising too hard or not hard enough. It connects to smartphones over Bluetooth wireless.Garmin (GRMN) showed off its new Vivofit fitness wristband. The device greets users with a personalized daily goal, tracks their progress and reminds them to move.The Vivofit has an always-on curved display that can show steps, goal countdown, calories, distance and time of day.One of the key differentiators with Vivofit is its long battery life. ""It has a year's worth of battery life,"" Garmin spokeswoman Jessica Koss said. ""We've tested it to 18 months.""The Vivofit starts at $129 and will ship this quarter.French tech firm Netatmo debuted a fashionable device that measures sun intensity and monitors your total daily sun exposure. The June can be worn as a wristband or brooch because it looks like a crystal. It is expected to cost $99 and be available in the spring. It uses low-power Bluetooth wireless to connect to Apple iPhones to share data. The device has about one month of battery life.Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet light is a concern for skin health because it can cause premature aging and cancer.

1234,GRMN,"When Mike Hicks began investing in the stock market almost 30 years ago, he practically gave up on analyzing the market itself. ""I was so confused by trying to interpret the market decades ago that I almost gave up trying and just focused on individual stocks, which was completely wrong,"" the retired CPA told IBD.""There was so much conflicting information out there, even for a certified public accountant, for an educated person,"" Hicks said. ""If you were trying to understand the 'experts,' one says 'A' and another says the opposite of 'A.' So you came away pretty much frustrated in that exercise, feeling that nobody can call the market.""That attitude turned 180 degrees when a friend showed Hicks a copy of IBD in the 1980s. The newspaper was launched as a daily in April 1984.""I was absolutely amazed that I almost had to sit in a chair,"" he said. ""This was what I was looking for all my life.""Hicks savored the screens of stocks that showed a rare combination of traits: strong volume demand and stellar fundamentals.""It was like heaven,"" he said. ""Now I could rely on the financial statement information, but I had the timing of how to read the chart and the backdrop of the all-important market status. So when you stack these advantages into your probability (of finding a winner), you start having markedly better success on a more consistent basis.""The ""Ask Bill"" series -- a former Investors.com feature that gave concise answers to questions submitted by readers about the stock market -- also energized Hicks. He says he printed out nearly every answer and stored them in a file for frequent reference.Hicks is not only a longtime IBD reader, but also a host of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla., Meetup group, one of the best-attended IBD Meetups in the U.S. (To find a Meetup in your area, hover the mouse over ""How to Invest"" in the main navigation bar at Investors.com, then click on ""IBD Meetups."")At a past gathering, 53 people showed up, a monthly record and all the more impressive considering that snowbirds from the Northeast had already headed back up the coast.The group, started in October 2003, had a humble start. It had no whiteboard on which to diagram the winning patterns that great stocks form before breaking out. No computer. No internet connection either. They examined charts with transparencies, a grease pen and an overhead projector.Now, Hicks and fellow staffers charge $26 a ticket. In return, the attendee gets a two-entree dinner with salad, bread, coffee and dessert, a batch of charts and other information, and several hours of education and guidance from veteran IBD readers on how to follow the market, how to build a watch list and how to use charts.""The problem all the Meetups will face is the room charge. You can handle the meal costs, because you're giving people the value of the meal, although they do complain about the quality of the food regularly,"" Hicks said with a laugh.""But I always tell them, 'Look, we're getting the room for such a discount because we're buying the meal, just pretend the meal is free.' I've been acting as assistant chef and telling them what vegetables were good to prepare from (the) frozen (stage). My line to the catering manager is, 'Look, please do not give us rubber carrots.' ""By adding a small override to the attendance fee, Hicks was able to raise enough funds to buy a digital projector and whiteboard to enhance the learning experience. He also gives a welcome package with 64 pages of material -- mostly Investor's Corner articles -- to new members.""We had borrowed a number of techniques from the (Meetup) folks in Chicago,"" he said.Hicks says a turning point in his investing life came in 2003. In the years preceding that, an 80-hour workweek and a string of personal tragedies made it hard for him to concentrate on the stock market.""In May 2003, I knew that IBD is a golden goose, so I decided that either I had to study it, like a CPA, or I had to discredit it and become a mutual fund investor,"" he said.After the grueling tax-return season, he spent a weekend that month going through the educational features on Investors.com.That's when he discovered ""Ask Bill."" He learned so much from each nugget of information that he locked himself in his study from Friday night to Sunday night, asking his wife to leave meals outside the door. His computer printer ran all day, all night.""It was an epiphany. I didn't know how the printer did not burn out,"" he said.He caught the new roaring bull market by the tail.GPS device leader Garmin (GRMN) was his first CAN SLIM stock, which he bought right at the breakout from a proper cup with handle in December 2002, two months after the major indexes bottomed. Hicks sold the stock for a 66% gain in less than six months.He scored a bunch of winners that year, nailing down gains of 30% to 60% each.Then came his all-time portfolio champ, stun gun maker Taser International (TASR).IBD: You scored a 100% gain the first time you bought Taser in 2003. Why did you buy it again?Hicks: I was sorry I sold it the first time. I was looking at a proper new entry point, and I saw that narrow opportunity in mid-December (1). It did not quite meet all the criteria, but you could just kind of tell (it was setting up for a new breakout). The way it acted reminded me of the Nicolas Darvas book, ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market."" You could almost see that stock crouching like a dancer crouching before he jumped.When I saw that settle down over the holiday season in December, I took a pretty significant position, and then I pyramided that position up in January. Then I just sat tight.I could not believe my eyes as the tens of thousands (of profits in dollars) rolled up. All my friends, of course, and my family, and wife said to me, 'Are you going to hold it until you lose it all?' It just kept going up and up, and I kept sitting with my lips pursed.It was just so strong, and the story was so profound; that weapon was saving lives.But by April of 2004, the day I sold was a Monday. Obviously I knew the quarterly earnings would be released at 4:05 p.m. (Eastern time) that day. It had all the signs of a climax top. I said to myself, the expectations on this stock have to be so incredibly high at this point, I don't think even Taser could meet them. So I picked up the phone, called my broker and told her to sell everything. It is the first, and probably last, time that I sold a stock right at the top."" (Hicks achieved a 285% gain on the position.)IBD: Which features in IBD do you discuss regularly at the Meetup?Hicks: What I use for the printouts every month for the Meetup is The Big Picture. It does a number of things, especially for new people, but I also use it personally to interpret the market for me, even after all these years.Not only does it explain the market, but it gives you every day a list of the leading stocks that were up or down in big volume. So you can use that every day to identify those quality stocks according to CAN SLIM principles. And the text usually discusses some of those stocks.I think a lot of people do not recognize the immense value of what they're looking at on that page. I'm not aware of any other publication that puts on the front page a market call every day and tells you to the exact day that a new rally starts. And they call the exact day that they think it stops. I think that's an incredible thing to put on the front page of a major financial publication.IBD: Do you encounter some attendees who mix the rules of CAN SLIM with other systems or their own?Hicks: Yes, we've had quite a few, actually. I try not to give my opinion but Bill O'Neil's opinion, and what he advocates in all his materials. Bill has studied all these methodologies as well as charting methodologies like candlesticks, for example ... and he's not apologetic to say matter-of-factly that he's looked at these and invalidated them, and that none of these are superior to a simple price and volume chart.(Editor's Note: This interview originally published in the June 3, 2011, edition of IBD.)

1235,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) stock is trading at levels that ""severely undervalue its earnings growth potential,"" Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a research report Wednesday.Uerkwitz reiterated his outperform rating on Fitbit stock with a 12- to 18-month price target of 25.Fitbit shares ended 0.4% higher at 13.56 on the stock market today. The maker of wearable fitness devices went public in June 2015 at 20 and climbed as high as 51.90 last August.Fitbit has been hounded this year by concerns about slowing growth and rising competition. Many investors are worried that Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch with fitness features, the Apple Watch, will eat into Fitbit's business. Other competitors include Garmin (GRMN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung.Fitbit's sales growth has decelerated for the last three quarters and Wall Street expects the trend to continue for the next two quarterly results. Fitbit's earnings per share fell on a year-over-year basis for the first time as a public company in Q1. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are forecasting declines in EPS for Q2 and Q3 also, as the company invests in marketing and R&D.Uerkwitz sees better times ahead for the San Francisco-based company.""Over the past four quarters, Fitbit has beaten consensus EPS by an average of 137% per quarter,"" Uerkwitz said. ""Yet in that same time period with mismatched guidance and expectations, the stock has fallen 54%. We believe this quarter (Q2), expectations are appropriately set.""A second tailwind is expected with product launches (announcements as soon as Q3).""Fitbit is expected to report Q2 earnings in early August.Uerkwitz is optimistic about Fitbit playing into such trends as digital health and corporate wellness. The company also has a large opportunity outside the U.S. Fitbit now gets about 20% of its sales from international markets and hopes to get that to 50%.""We believe this quarter could provide the 'green shoots' needed for a strong stock recovery into second-half 2016,"" Uerkwitz said. ""Repeat customers, new product traction, importance of digital health, and healthy gross margins could be areas where we get positive data points. With each, fears are eased.""RELATED:Fitbit Named Morgan Stanley's Top Consumer Electronics Stock PickFitbit Faces Pricing Pressure From Samsung, Other Vendors

1236,GRMN,"Action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) was tossed in the discount bin this year after investors gave up on the company as a one-hit-wonder in a saturated market.The big question now is whether the company has a second act. Many analysts say that second act could be the company's delayed flying camera drone, dubbed Karma. It's scheduled to launch in time for holiday shopping.In a research report Wednesday, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said GoPro stock appears to have established its near-term bottom following a weak product cycle in 2015 and ensuing inventory issues.Investor sentiment should improve in the next three months, as GoPro releases a long-overdue product update, the Hero 5 camera, Uerkwitz said.Still, he says GoPro has a tough road ahead. It won't expand the market for action cameras unless it can make video editing and sharing simpler, Uerkwitz said. And he says the drone business might not generate enough sales to make a huge difference for GoPro.He reiterated his perform rating on GoPro stock.""While near-term headwinds may have subsided, GoPro is still subject to the structural decline in the consumer camera market,"" Uerkwitz said. ""Additionally, the camera drone market is expected to see intense price competition from more experienced Chinese competitors.""Our current model implies less than 4% revenue contribution from drones in 2016.""In a sign of how tough the action camera market has become, GoPro competitor iON Worldwide filed for bankruptcy protection in late June after seeing its revenue drop significantly last year.New Jersey-based iON makes wearable video cameras, as well as dashboard cameras and home security cameras.GoPro also competes with cameras from Garmin (GRMN), Sony (SNE) and others.GoPro stock was down a fraction to 12.43 at the close on the stock market today, and it's lower by more than 25% so far this year.

Rising terror attacks in Europe and the U.S. also stoked fears.Estimates: Wall Street expects $1.15 EPS, up 26% from 91 cents a share a year ago. No consensus revenue estimate was available, but the gunmaker reported $140.9 million revenue in Q2 2015, and its revenue has been growing in the mid-20% range.

Liu expects Fitbit to release new products in late Q3 or early Q4, possibly new versions of the Flex and Charge HR.Liu is not concerned about competition in wearables from Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch, the Apple Watch.""Both can succeed in wearables, as they only have some overlap in products, services and pricing,"" he said.Meanwhile, Garmin, which makes GPS navigation devices, sports watches and fitness trackers, is performing in line with expectations, Liu said.""Our checks suggest some of Garmin's fitness products are not resonating with mainstream consumers despite a new marketing campaign, while others are popular in the high end,"" Liu said. ""Outside of fitness, Garmin's outdoor and aviation businesses are delivering good growth and strong margins, and marine margins are improving.""GoPro, meanwhile, continues to struggle as action camera sales decline.""We are concerned GoPro's new Hero 5 camera this year will not have enough differentiation to drive a refresh cycle, and the Karma drone may be further delayed,"" Liu said.GoPro has done well with power users, such as extreme athletes, but hasn't broken through to mainstream consumers, Liu said.

The stock sliced through its 50-day moving average, a key support level, in touching a six-week low.Late Wednesday, Fitbit smashed Wall Street’s targets for the first quarter, but the company delivered mixed guidance for the current quarter.

On a year-over-year basis, Q1 sales rose 50%, but earnings dropped 63%.For the current quarter, Fitbit is projecting earnings per share of 8 to 11 cents excluding items on sales of $575 million at the midpoint of guidance. Wall Street had been modeling Fitbit to earn 26 cents a share on sales of $531.3 million.Fitbit competes in the health and fitness wearables market with Apple (AAPL), Garmin (GRMN) and others.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz reiterated his outperform rating on Fitbit stock with a 12- to 18-month price target of 25.The digital health market is showing strong demand, but Fitbit management “is struggling with the pushes and pulls of operating a rapidly growing business,” he said in a research report. Volatility in operating expenses is pressuring the stock, he says.Fitbit bulls say the company is “striking while the iron is hot” and ramping up marketing and R&D spending to capitalize on the growing market. But bears argue that if Fitbit “takes its foot off the gas, the ride will stop,” Uerkwitz said.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating on Fitbit stock but trimmed his price target to 22 from 25.S&P Global analyst Angelo Zino kept his hold rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 20.“Fitbit is seeing good penetration for its newest devices, Blaze and Alta,” Zino said in a report. “But we are cautious about elevated second-half expectations and intense competitive pressures.”Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor said Fitbit’s higher sales and marketing spending has placed “unrealistic expectations of profitability” in the second half of the year.“This is particularly worrying as there are clear signs that commoditization is forcing the company to increase spending, hitting profits,” he said in a report.To meet its EPS guidance, Fitbit will need to generate 83% of its net profit in the last six months of the year, he said.“Given the environment, this looks to be a very tall order and there is likely a heavy cut to full-year EPS guidance coming either in June or October,” Windsor said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy reiterated her neutral rating on Fitbit, with a price target of 16.“While we are pleased with the traction of new products, we are wary of the Q4-weighted guide and opt to remain on sidelines,” she said in a report.On the company's earnings conference call with analysts, Fitbit CEO James Park expressed confidence in the company’s ability to continue to lead the nascent digital health market.“Fitbit has had an incredible and consistent track record of creating and launching innovative devices and software that people love,” he said. “Over nine years of creating and leading this category, we've gained a deep and proprietary understanding of the market and our customers.”San Francisco-based Fitbit is putting a lot of “marketing muscle” worldwide behind its Blaze fitness watch and Alta activity tracker, which were both launched in March, Park said.Retail sales tracker NPD Group on Thursday reported that Fitbit remained the king of connected digital fitness devices in the first quarter. It said Fitbit accounted for 81% of the dollars spent in the category in the U.S. in Q1.Fitbit does most of its business in the U.S. In Q1, 70% of Fitbit’s revenue came from the U.S. Europe, Middle East and Africa contributed 15% of sales, followed by Asia-Pacific with 11%.

A year ago, the stock traded near 50.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the San Mateo, Calif.-based company to lose 60 cents a share in Q1, compared with earnings per share of 24 cents in the year-earlier period. Sales are forecast to decline 53% to $169.1 million.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for GoPro to lose 43 cents a share, compared with year-ago earnings of 35 cents a share, on sales of $245.6 million, down 42%.GoPro is facing concerns about market saturation and pricing pressure from competitors, including Garmin (GRMN), Sony (SNE) and others.Possible catalysts for the company include an upcoming flying-camera drone -- a quadcopter called Karma -- and devices for recording 360-degree videos for virtual reality headsets like Facebook’s (FB) Oculus Rift. Karma is expected to debut this quarter.“We applaud GoPro’s recent moves to build a deeper technical bench and listen closely to customer and partner demands.” Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a research report Tuesday. “However, we remain sidelined as upcoming product releases (drone, flagship camera, and possibly a 360-degree camera) can introduce much volatility.”Uerkwitz rates GoPro stock as perform, or hold.“We believe the March quarter results and June quarter guidance could be a bit rough as the company is in full-on transition mode,” Uerkwitz said. “We may see inventory issues (the March quarter is typically slow) for older cameras in the channels.”Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson reiterated his neutral rating on GoPro stock in a report Wednesday.“GoPro is currently suffering from a stale product portfolio and delayed efforts to improve editing software and general usability,” Anderson said. “This is harming demand and leading to declining sales.""The response has been a large increase in both R&D and sales and marketing spend, which is going to lead to near-term losses. We believe the company needs new, and differentiated, products to pull it out of the hole.”RELATED:GoPro Finds Woe In High Action-Camera Inventories

1245,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) is due for a health checkup late Wednesday and the prognosis for its first-quarter earnings report is looking favorable.But investors got the jitters on the eve of the company's Q1 report. Fitbit stock fell 6.5% to 17.18 in heavy volume on the stock market today. Fitbit stock has tumbled more than 40% this year as competition has risen and the pace of growth has slowed.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the maker of wearable fitness devices to earn 2 cents a share excluding items on sales of $443.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, sales would be up 32% if it meets the consensus forecast. That would be down from 92% growth in Q4, 168% in Q3 and 253% in Q2. Fitbit made its IPO last June, pricing shares at 20.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 26 cents a share, up 24%, on sales of $532.8 million, up 33%.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson on Monday reiterated his sector weight, or hold, rating on Fitbit stock.Erickson expects a “beat-and-raise” quarter from Fitbit, but is cautious based on “longer-term views of poor category user trends, a lack of sensor differentiation and a more limited total addressable market.”In the near term, demand appears relatively healthy for the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and the Alta activity tracker, he said. Fitbit also has stocked the retail channel with Charge HR devices for Mother’s Day sales, he said in a research report.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy maintained her neutral rating on Fitbit with a price target of 16.“While data points during the quarter have been positive, with strong Amazon (AMZN) trends for the newly launched Alta and Blaze models, we remain on the sidelines behind the second-half weighted earnings (we estimate 70% of earnings lie in 2H) and given the tougher product launch comparisons in 2H,” she said in a report Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Betty Chen kept her buy rating and price target of 20 on Fitbit stock in a report Monday.“Our recent survey highlights increases in Fitbit ownership as well as planned purchase intent at higher average selling prices,” she said. “Moreover, data indicates increased upgrade intent and attachment rate, with 21% of Fitbit device buyers purchasing at least one additional wristband in the last three months. We believe this bodes well for Fitbit’s long-term growth and margin profile.”Last week, diversified rival Garmin (GRMN) said its sales of wearable fitness devices rose 9% year over year in Q1, to $142.4 million, but profit margins declined because of intense competition in the category. Garmin also makes GPS navigation devices for automotive, aviation, marine and outdoor markets.In addition to Fitbit and Garmin, other companies competing in the health-and-fitness wearables sector include Apple (AAPL), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Bolsters China Prospects With E-Commerce Deal

1246,GRMN,"More than a year after the Apple Watch first went on sale, Apple (AAPL) still has not disclosed how many it has sold.In the four quarters since it debuted at retail, Apple CEO Tim Cook has made positive, yet vague, statements about sales of the Apple Watch. On the company's fiscal Q2 earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Cook said that Apple Watch sales “met our expectations” in the March quarter.“We started shipping Apple Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world,” Cook said. “In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year.”During its first year of availability, the iPhone sold 5.4 million units.At least 12 analysts have estimated Apple’s watch sales for the company’s fiscal second quarter. Baird analyst William Power has the highest estimate at 3.125 million units. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has the lowest estimate 1.4 million units.The average estimate of the dozen analysts was 2.3 million units. Based on quarterly estimates, Apple Watch sales reached 13.2 million units during its first year of availability.Apple competes in the smartwatch market with devices from Samsung, Garmin (GRMN), Fitbit (FIT) and others.Apple launched the Apple Watch on April 24, 2015, in nine countries, including the U.S., and it’s now available in 60 countries. Apple is expected to come out with a second-generation Apple Watch this fall, ahead of the holiday shopping season.“For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter,” Cook said.Apple Watch users enjoy responding to messages, managing calendars, navigating with maps and tracking their health and fitness from the wrist device, Cook said.

1247,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) late Wednesday smashed Wall Street's targets for the first quarter, but delivered mixed guidance for the current quarter that disappointed investors, with EPS falling far short of Wall Street expectations but revenue beating estimates.Fitbit stock was down over 10% in after-hours trading following the earnings news release. In Wednesday's regular session, Fitbit stock dipped a fraction, to 17.10. Fitbit made its IPO last June, pricing shares at 20.The maker of wearable fitness devices earned 10 cents a share excluding items on sales of $505.4 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 3 cents and $444.3 million. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 sales rose 50%. But that's down from 92% growth in Q4, 168% in Q3 and 253% in Q2.Q1 earnings per share dropped 63% from 27 cents in the year-earlier period. It was the company’s first year-over-year decline in earnings per share in over two years.For the current quarter, Fitbit is projecting earnings per share of 8 to 11 cents excluding items on sales of $565 million to $585 million, or $575 million at the midpoint. Wall Street had been modeling Fitbit to earn 26 cents a share, up 24%, on sales of $531.3 million, up 33%.For the year, Fitbit expects non-GAAP EPS of $1.12 to $1.24 on sales of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Analysts on average were looking for 2016 EPS of $1.13 on sales of $2.46 billion.“The strong growth and defensibility of our business continues to be powered by product innovation, the network effects of our community, our expanding global distribution, and investment in our brand,” Fitbit CEO James Park said in a statement. “Based on the first quarter’s performance and momentum, we are confident about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in our increased guidance.”Fitbit competes in the health and fitness wearables market with Apple (AAPL), Garmin (GRMN), Microsoft (MSFT), Under Armour (UA) and others.Fitbit sold 4.8 million connected health and fitness devices in the first quarter, up 23% from 3.9 million in Q1 2015. New products, including the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and Fitbit Alta activity tracker, accounted for 47% of the company's revenue.Last week, Fitbit announced a distribution deal Chinese e-commerce website Tmall.com, a unit of Alibaba Group (BABA), that could bolster its prospects in China.Operating expenses rose to 39.3% of revenue in Q1, compared with 32.2% in Q4 2015 and 22.3% in the year-earlier quarter. The increase reflected growing investment in research and development and marketing expenses.

1248,GRMN,"Retail checks by Morgan Stanley showed good news for Fitbit (FIT), bad news for GoPro (GPRO) and mixed news for Garmin (GRMN).Fitbit's new Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband appear to be selling well and could drive upside to Fitbit's Q1 earnings and Q2 guidance, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report Monday.“Our checks indicate demand for Blaze and Alta were ahead of expectations, and retailers are already putting in reorders for the Blaze, which shipped earlier than the Alta,” Huberty said.How fit are shares of Fitbit and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFitbit reported March 31 that it had shipped more than 1 million units each of the Blaze and Alta within their first month of availability.“We expect management will remain conservative on guidance but still expect Q2 estimates to move higher post-earnings,” she said.Meanwhile, retail checks for GoPro action cameras point to year-over-year declines in sell-through, with retailers still working down channel inventory.“Our conversations suggest enthusiasm for the product category continues to wane, and the upcoming Hero 5 is unlikely to recapture retailer shelf space lost during the recent spring reset,” Huberty said.She is cautious on GoPro’s upcoming quadcopter “flying camera” product, though the market appears to be picking up. Competitors are expected to launch lower-priced drones, hurting sales of GoPro’s premium product.Fitbit rival Garmin is retaining market share in high-end sports watches, but it appears to be losing share in activity trackers, Huberty said.Fitbit rose 2.3% to 14.84 on the stock market today, while GoPro lost 4.5% to 11.77, and Garmin stock finished 0.8% higher at 39.94.

1249,GRMN,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) announced Thursday that it shipped more than 1 million units each of its latest products -- the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and Fitbit Alta fitness wristband -- in their first month of availability.Fitbit stock has been depressed this year in part because investors were disappointed in the company's products announced since the CES in January. Fitbit went public last June 18 at 20 and climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5. Fitbit stock was up over 6% to above 14 in midday trading on the stock market today.Fitbit's message on Thursday was that both new products are off to a strong start.The San Francisco-based company said its Blaze sales have exceeded the company's internal forecasts. Some industry analysts were worried the fitness-centric watch would compare poorly to Apple's (AAPL) more capable, yet pricier, Apple Watch.Since its launch, Fitbit Blaze has been the No. 1 best-selling device in the smartwatch and heart-monitor categories on Amazon.com (AMZN). Fitbit Alta also is currently one of the top-selling devices in the fitness tracker and pedometer categories on Amazon.“At Fitbit, we continue to focus on developing innovative and motivating fitness-first products that our customers love and that help them achieve their health and fitness goals,” Woody Scal, chief business officer at Fitbit, said in a statement. “The positive response we’ve received to Blaze and Alta demonstrates our continued ability to innovate and drive strong demand for Fitbit products, which is what has made and kept us the leader in the global wearables category.”The Fitbit Blaze costs $199.95. Last week, Apple cut the starting price for its Apple Watch to $299 from $349.The Fitbit Alta costs $129.95. It competes with fitness trackers from Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and others.

1250,GRMN,"Federal regulators appear to be warming up to a radio spectrum proposal from Ligado Networks, formerly LightSquared, which could provide AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) or T-Mobile US (TMUS) with a new strategic option -- but could spell trouble for Dish Network (DISH) and its spectrum holdings.The Federal Communications Commission recently began its Broadcast Incentive Auction involving airwaves owned by local TV stations. The top bidders are expected to be AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. The complex auction is expected to drag on for months.Ligado’s re-emergence from Chapter 11 has been a wild card. Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile might be less likely to buy Dish’s spectrum or partner with the satellite TV broadcaster if Ligado’s spectrum becomes commercially available. Dish has struggled to find a wireless partner to pursue mobile video services.Former Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member. Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 megahertz of midband spectrum.“Recent filings suggest the FCC may soon open inquiry on Ligado’s new spectrum proposal,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a research report. “We believe Ligado’s restructured spectrum plan stands a reasonable chance of winning FCC approval.“If Ligado’s path to market becomes clear, it (would be) a long-term positive for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and a potential concern for Dish’s spectrum valuation (if Dish has not already monetized its spectrum).”After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado has reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference.

1251,GRMN,"Under Armour's (UA) ""connected fitness"" community is adding about a million users to the platform every eight days, CEO Kevin Plank said during a keynote panel at SXSW Interactive.He also emphasized the company's device agnosticism, saying if users want to strap on a Fitbit (FIT) wearable and a Garmin (GRMN) heart rate monitor and use a different brand of scale -- ""go for it.""The company's suite of apps has over 160 million users, Chief Digital Officer Robin Thurston told IBD in January. That includes acquired properties MapMyFitness, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal, as well as Under Armour's own revamped UA Record app, which is now powered by IBM's (IBM) Watson.Shares closed down 0.8% and are trading above their 50-day line after finding support in mid-February. But the stock remains below the key 200-day level after breaking support late last year.While its apps can be used with other smart devices, Under Armour has partnered with HTC and begun pursuit of the wearables market. It recently introduced its own collection of health-tracking wearables, which include a fitness band, smart scale and heart rate strap.The ever-bullish Plank also had a few choice words for his largest competitor.When moderator and Fast Company Editor-In-Chief Robert Safian mentioned the launch of Nike's (NKE) now-defunct fitness tracker, FuelBand, at SXSW several years ago, Plank cheekily interjected: ""How'd that work out?""""In my industry, I get frustrated when people talk about how innovative our competitors are,"" Plank said later during the panel, contrasting the rapid evolution of the smartphone to the more static history of shirt and shoe development.In a likely reference to Nike's new FlyKnit technology, Plank downplayed the praiseworthiness of creating a knit upper for sports footwear, calling such innovation ""lazy.""And while Under Armour aligns itself with that underdog mentality, Plank made it clear that he's focused on continuing to make a profit, unlike some startups.""Winning is cultural. Losing money is cultural,"" he said. ""If you get used to losing money, it’s really hard to stop.""Shares of Nike rallied 1.2% Monday, as Fitbit dipped 0.3%, Garmin lost 1.1%, and IBM edged up 0.3%.RELATED:Can Under Armour’s Wearables Woo The Next Generation From Nike?Image provided by Shutterstock.

1252,GRMN,"Fitness band ownership among women, a key demographic for the product, is still rising, but purchase intent has slipped, according to Piper Jaffray's sixth semiannual women's survey.Piper Jaffray reported Wednesday that 21% of women surveyed own a fitness band, up from 18% in the fall survey. Meanwhile, 9% of women said they own a smartwatch, up from 8% in the fall.However, the intent to buy a fitness band in the next six months fell to 15% in the spring survey, from 19% in the fall. Intent to buy a smartwatch also dipped, falling to 10% in the spring survey from 13% last fall.“While ownership has improved, we did detect the first downtick in future spending intentions on the (fitness band) category,” Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a report. “We could be approaching a saturation point with select brands.”Fitbit (FIT) remained the No. 1 preferred fitness band, with 77% mindshare, up from 68% six months ago. Garmin (GRMN) and Jawbone tied for second place, each with 5% share.Apple (AAPL) led the smartwatch category with 49% share, up from 42% six months ago. Fitbit jumped to the No. 2 spot after announcing its Fitbit Blaze smartwatch. It grabbed 20% mindshare, up 9% last fall. Samsung fell to third place with 14% share, down from 19% six months ago.Fitbit overtook Under Armour (UA) as the top fitness app provider in the spring survey. Fitbit garnered 29% mindshare in fitness apps, up from 18% last fall.

1253,GRMN,"Outdoor, fitness and navigation technology company Garmin (GRMN) surprised Wall Street on Wednesday with better-than-expected fourth quarter results, sending its shares almost 17% higher.The Olathe, Kans.-based firm earned 74 cents a share on sales of $781 million for the quarter ended Dec. 26. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Garmin to earn 48 cents a share on sales of $760 million.On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales were down 4% and 3%, respectively, as Garmin's once-core automotive GPS navigation device business continues its secular decline.The company’s auto segment sales fell 21% year over year to $268 million in Q4.Garmin’s top-performing segment was fitness devices, with sales rising 14% to nearly $229 million.Garmin’s outdoor segment sales rose 6% to almost $124 million. Aviation segment sales jumped 12% to $104 million. Marine segment sales climbed 8% to $56 million.Garmin stock rose 16.6% to 41.06 on the stock market today after the company announced Q4 earnings.On a conference call with analysts, Garmin CEO Cliff Pemble said the company’s investments to diversify from personal navigation devices are paying off. Excluding the auto segment, sales grew 11% year over year. The aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor segments together contributed 66% of revenue in Q4.In the fitness device market, Garmin dominates the high-end running and sports watches segment. But it has been competing more with Fitbit (FIT) and others in the activity tracker business.William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Garmin stock.Garmin’s 2016 guidance was a “source of relief” for investors, Ho said. Its full-year sales target of $2.82 billion was slightly above Wall Street’s consensus. But its EPS goal of $2.25 was 5 cents below consensus. Garmin also announced plans to maintain its current quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share over the next four quarters.“These results were better than investors feared, given the global macroeconomic challenges, competition, pricing pressure and currency headwinds that the company faced,” Ho said. “We were impressed by a solidly executed quarter that led revenue and EPS to be meaningfully above expectations and a solid guide that takes into account a still-challenging environment.” 
"
1254,GRMN,"Shipments of Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch, the Apple Watch, slowed in the fourth quarter, as the rest of the wearable device market jumped for the holiday shopping season.Market research firm IDC on Tuesday said Apple shipped 4.1 million Apple Watch units in Q4, up 5.1% from the 3.9 million units it shipped in Q3. That growth is down from the 8.3% increase in Apple Watch shipments in the third quarter compared with Q2, when the product debuted.Shipments of wearable devices excluding Apple's rose 17.9% from Q2 to Q3 and 36.3% from Q3 to Q4, according to IDC.Fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) remained the top maker of wearables worldwide in the fourth quarter. It shipped 8.1 million devices, giving it 29.5% market share, IDC said. That's up from 22.2% market share in Q3 and 24.3% in Q2.Apple claimed second place with 15% market share, down from 18.6% in Q3 and 19.9% in Q2.China-based Xiaomi placed third with 9.7% market share, followed by Samsung (4.9%) and Garmin (GRMN) (3.5%).Total industry shipments of wearable devices reached 27.4 million units in Q4, IDC said. That's up 30.4% from Q3 and 126.9% from Q4 2014.“Triple-digit growth highlights growing interest in the wearables market from both end-users and vendors,” IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said. “It shows that wearables are not just for the technophiles and early adopters; wearables can exist and are welcome in the mass market.”The wearables market is currently dominated by fitness bands and smartwatches, but it’s likely to diversify into other forms, such as smart clothing, footwear and eyewear, IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a report.Fitbit remains the “undisputed worldwide leader” in wearables, thanks to its well-segmented device portfolio, focus on fitness, a fast-growing corporate wellness program and extended market reach around the world, IDC said.Apple grew its Apple Watch unit volumes only slightly in Q4 from the previous quarter despite expanded distribution and holiday sales promotions, IDC noted. Expectations are higher for the company’s next-generation Apple Watch, which could leverage Apple’s platforms like HealthKit and bolster connectivity capabilities, IDC said.A second-generation Apple Watch could be revealed as soon as next month, when Apple is planning to hold its spring product briefing.RELATED:Fitbit Q4 Beats, But Q1 Targets Disappoint; Stock Plunges LateSmartwatch Shipments Skyrocket In Q4, Passing Swiss Watches.

1255,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) stock fell off the treadmill Tuesday, a day after the maker of wearable fitness devices reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but guided Wall Street much lower than expected for the current quarter.Fitbit shares were down 19%, near 13.40, in midday trading on the stock market today, and at least five investment banks downgraded their rating on the company. Fitbit stock hit its all-time low of 12.90 on Feb. 11, after the company went public in June at 20 a share and peaked in August near 52.Several analysts downgraded the stock or cut their price targets after the San Francisco-based company late Monday posted Q4 earnings and gave Q1 and full-year 2016 guidance.In Q4, Fitbit earned 35 cents a share, excluding items, on sales of $712 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 67%, and sales jumped 92% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 25 cents ex items on sales of $648 million.But for the current quarter, Fitbit is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 1 cent on sales of $430 million, at the midpoint of its guidance range. Analysts were modeling 23 cents and $485 million.Fitbit Chief Financial Officer Bill Zerella said Q1 is a product transition quarter, with the launch of the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband in March, as well as the discontinuation of the Fitbit Charge. Fitbit expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses because of the global product launches, plus additional manufacturing expenses to maximize production of the new products.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy downgraded Fitbit stock to neutral from overweight and slashed her price target to 14 from 24. The outlook for Fitbit’s new products is cloudy, and the company faces tough year-over-year comparisons in the second half of the year, she said in a research report.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson downgraded Fitbit stock to sector weight from overweight. He cited the risk of hardware commoditization and poor user metrics as reasons for the change.“We see little likelihood of dispelling anytime soon the longer-term bear thesis of slowing growth, pricing pressure and longer-term commoditization,” he said in a report.Fitbit is looking like the next GoPro (GPRO), a hardware company facing market saturation, slowing growth and margin and earnings erosion, he said.Erickson is also concerned about active-user trends. Fitbit added 18 million new registered device users in 2015, of which 13 million, or 72%, were active users at year-end.Erickson says Fitbit stock has a fair value of 14.Cowen analyst John Kernan reiterated his market perform rating on Fitbit stock but axed his price target to 19 from 41.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating but cleaved his price target to 25 from 50.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra kept his neutral rating on Fitbit and price target of 18.To turn things around, Fitbit needs to show leverage in the corporate wellness market, improve customer retention, and come out with new products with breakthrough sensors.Despite shipping over 30 million devices in the past two years, Fitbit ended 2015 with 16.9 million active users.“This kind of ‘churn’ is likely just natural and systemic to the health/fitness market, as some Fitbits ending up in drawers seems comparable to well-intentioned health club memberships that don’t get used,” Cihra said in a report.Fitbit faces competition from makers of dedicated fitness products such as Garmin (GRMN) and Under Armour (UA), but also from makers of smartwatches with fitness features such as Apple's (AAPL) Apple Watch.

1256,GRMN,"Fitbit's (FIT) fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday could be an opportunity for the maker of wearable fitness devices to get investors interested in its story again.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said Fitbit's Q4 report is ""likely a catalyst"" for its shares. She reiterated her overweight rating on the stock but slashed her price target to 24 from 60 on reset expectations for the San Francisco-based company.Fitbit went public on June 18 at 20 and climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5. The stock cratered after a disappointing showing at the CES consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas in early January.On Friday, Fitbit stock fell 2.5% to 15.60 after rival Garmin (GRMN) announced two new fitness wearables that will ship in the second quarter.Garmin introduced the Vivofit 3 daily activity tracker and Vivoactive HR smartwatch. The Vivofit 3 starts at $99.99 and features one-year battery life and automatic activity detection. The Vivoactive HR is a GPS smartwatch with wrist-based heart-rate tracking and costs $249.99.“While Fitbit has clearly been a very challenged stock year-to-date, we remain overweight on the stock into the Q4 print,” Murphy said in a report. “As we are now past the share lockup period, investors should begin looking at fundamentals again.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Fitbit to earn 25 cents a share excluding items on sales of $648 million in the December quarter. Sales in the year-earlier period were $370 million.For the March quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 23 cents a share on sales of $485 million. In Q1 2015, Fitbit reported sales of $337 million.“We view fiscal 2016 favorably, given already announced new product launches (with more to come), the opportunity on the corporate wellness side, and an attractive multiple entry point into shares,” Murphy said.Fitbit’s newest products, the Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband, are set to go on sale in March.Fitbit faces a host of competitors in addition to Garmin. They include Apple (AAPL), Fossil (FOSL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).On Wednesday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson reiterated his overweight rating on Fitbit but cut his price target to 31 from 47.“Demand appears steady after the holiday, but days of inventory are higher,” Erickson said. “Our upside bias to numbers remains and valuation is compelling, but we are tempering our expectations for multiple expansion, given inevitably slowing growth in 2016, even as corporate wellness remains a free call option in the name.”RELATED:Fitbit 2016 Outlook An Exercise In Worry For Investors?Fitbit Gets Fashionable With Alta Fitness Wristband.

It was the second weak data point for housing markets this week, after a surprise pullback in builder confidence from the National Association of Homebuilders' Housing Market Index on Tuesday.Industrial production was positive, rising 0.9% in January according to Federal Reserve numbers. The Fed also revised its December estimate downward, to an 0.7% decline. Economists had projected a gain of 0.4% for January. Utilization of factory capacity also improved, edging up to 77.1% vs. 76.5% utilization in December. Economists had projected a very mild uptick to 76.4% in January.Oil prices upshifted from their early gains, with West Texas Intermediate climbing nearly 3% to nearly $30 a barrel. Brent crude also gained 3% to $33.15 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration delayed its weekly inventories report, normally released on Wednesday, until Thursday.Dow stocks rose almost unanimously. McDonald's (MCD) was the weak spot, down more than 1%. Boeing (BA) topped the group, rising more than 2% following news that China's Okay Airways had committed to an order for 12 new 737s, valued at $1.3 billion.Priceline (PCLN) and Garmin (GRMN) duked out it at the head of the Nasdaq 100.Priceline gapped up to an 11% gain after reporting its Q4 earnings rose 16% to $12.63 a share, better than consensus forecasts for a 9% gain. Revenue also outpaced estimates. First quarter earnings guidance just met expectations. The gain hoisted Priceline back above its 50-day moving average to a test of resistance at its 200-day line. The stock is now 29% above an early February low and 16% below a November high.Garmin screamed ahead 13% as its its fourth quarter earnings decline of 4% clobbered expectations for a 37% drop. Revenue slipped 4%, also less than expected. Full-year earnings guidance was below expectations but revenue guidance was above expectations.  The advance drove Garmin above its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The stock remains 23% below its 52-week high.Fossil Group (FOSL) ran at the head of the S&P 500, up 23% after reporting strong Q4 results, but offering mixed Q1 guidance.Among IBD 50 stocks, Public Storage (PSA) locked up a 4% gain as its Q4 earnings edged out consensus estimates. A 9% revenue increase stopped just short of forecasts. The gain lifted shares for a test of resistance at the stock's 50-day moving average. It triggered a sell signal earlier this month, when it breached the support level in strong trade.Ireland-based airline Ryanair (RYAAY) bucked up 3% in powerful trade. The stock is still below its 50-day moving average, but up 11% from a February 8 low and climbing the right side of a potential cup base.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1259,GRMN,"Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, but other spectrum-related developments loom as wild cards that could increase supply, thereby impacting wireless industry competition and M&As.Those other developments include the contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety; the re-emergence of LightSquared, renamed Ligado Networks, from Chapter 11; and whether wireless firms succeed in lobbying to use commercial LTE technology in unlicensed spectrum now allocated to Wi-Fi.The Federal Communications Commission still plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Results of the spectrum auction could affect the competitive future of IBD Leaderboard company AT&T (T), which has seen accelerating growth in recent quarters, and rival Verizon Communications (VZ) -- a member of IBD’s Big Cap 20 -- as well as highly rated Comcast (CMCSA). AT&T and Verizon are expected to buy TV airwaves in the auction, and cable leader Comcast also will likely bid, say analysts. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out.AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and can pass through walls, improving in-building services.The FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiation over spectrum until the auction is over. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has acquired some 75 MHz of midband spectrum -- which covers a little less territory than low-frequency spectrum -- but it lacks a wireless network partner and is in limbo until the auction ends, analysts say. Dish has filed to bid in the auction, but observers are uncertain that it will.The auction's outcome could well raise or lower the odds of some major deals, long rumored in the industry:-- that Comcast will acquire a wireless services provider;-- that a cable TV leader will strike an alliance with Verizon;-- that Verizon will enter into a spectrum-leasing deal with Dish;-- that Dish and T-Mobile will merge.But even beyond the auction, by early 2017, further developments involving the FirstNet contract, Ligado, unlicensed-LTE and satellite wireless firm Globalstar (GSAT) could impact Dish’s plans, as well as the spectrum strategies of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. That’s because all these elements provide alternatives for network capacity, aside from the auction.Here’s a run-down of several scenarios:-- FirstNet. Whoever wins this first-responder contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum -- a wide swath of the airwaves -- in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network.The winning bidder is expected to enter into a lease agreement with the FirstNet authority for access to the 20 MHz of prime airwaves. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.The government will award the FirstNet contract after the TV airwave auction ends, if the government's timetable proceeds as planned. Verizon has been viewed as the front-runner, but AT&T has made clear that it’s interested. T-Mobile (TMUS) could bid but faces long odds vs. AT&T and Verizon, analysts say.-- LTE-U. Verizon and T-Mobile have been biggest proponents of developing a technical standard that would allow 4G LTE commercial technology to use unlicensed spectrum. Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies Wi-Fi network gear, have lobbied the FCC to protect unlicensed airwaves, saying that interference could impair Wi-Fi services. Apple (AAPL), a Wi-Fi Alliance member, has not said anything publicly.Verizon and AT&T claim that no special LTE-U equipment certification is needed as long as devices meet certain basic FCC rules for unlicensed spectrum. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been backing LTE-U deployment. The FCC in February allowed Qualcomm to move ahead with LTE-U testing at two Verizon facilities to demonstrate that the technology would not interfere with Wi-Fi. Qualcomm and the Wi-Fi Alliance have been working on “coexistence” plans.The cable TV industry has a big stake in the outcome, analysts say, because Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and others have been expanding public Wi-Fi networks. While Verizon has targeted 3.5 GHz spectrum in the near term, it could try to carry out LTE-U in higher 5 GHz airwaves that cable TV firms covet.If LTE-U gets a green light, the Apple iPhone and other devices could support the technology by 2018.-- LightSquared, now Ligado. Former Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member.Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 MHz of midband spectrum. After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference. While Ligado might provide services to industries such as energy or transport, or pursue next-generation 5G services, it could sell the airwaves as well.The company hasn’t spelled out its new business model, analysts say, and it’s still awaiting some FCC approvals to use the spectrum for commercial purposes.-- Globalstar.  The FCC has been studying Globalstar’s petition to use airwaves in the midfrequency 2.4 GHz block for wireless services. The Wi-Fi Alliance and other groups have opposed Globalstar’s plans, citing possible interference issues. Globalstar could lease capacity to a wireless firm or an Internet company if it wins at the FCC. Globalstar’s stock, though, has plunged about 50% in the past year to near 1.40 while its FCC approval has languished.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1260,GRMN,"Stocks rolled out a fast start Tuesday, boosted by a surprise jump in January construction spending.The Nasdaq popped 1%, the S&P 500 jumped 0.8%, and the Dow industrials climbed 0.7%.Early trading volume on the stock market today swept higher, up 20% on the Nasdaq and up 33% on the NYSE vs. trade at the same time Monday.Early economic news was fair to middling, with researcher Markit reporting its final February manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index at 51.3.  That was down from January's 52.4 tally but even with economists' consensus. The report said production volumes rose at their slowest pace in 28 months, and job growth moderated to a five-month low.Construction spending jumped 1.5% in January, the Commerce Department said, well above expectations for a 0.5% improvement. The department also revised December spending upward to a 0.6% gain.The Institute for Supply Management's February manufacturing index edged up to 49.5 for February. The below-50 number still denoted contraction in the sector but was above January's 48.2 reading.Of the Dow stocks, 29 of 30 rose at the start of trade. Stocks with gains of more than 1% included DuPont (DD), IBM (IBM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL).  United Technologies (UTX) reversed its premarket gain and dropped 3% as Honeywell International (HON) announced it had dropped its merger efforts after being straight-armed by UTX.Garmin (GRMN), Qorvo (QRVO), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Ford (F) duked it out at the head of the S&P 500, all up around 3% apiece. Ford reported sales surged 20% year-over-year in February. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) said February sales rose 12%. General Motors (GM) turned in a 7% increase.Among IBD 50 stocks, New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) popped 3% in powerful trade. The stock is trading 3% below a 33.01 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Fax and voicemail provider J2 Global (JCOM) also added nearly 3% in strong trade, rising to test resistance at its 50-day moving average. The stock is working to climb the right side of a possible two-month cup base.At the bottom of the list, Prestige Brand Holdings (PBH), Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) all fell more than 1%.

1262,GRMN,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) late Monday beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets for the holiday quarter, but its guidance for the current quarter came up well short of analyst expectations.Fitbit shares were down 14% in after-hours trading following the earnings news. During the regular trading session Monday, Fitbit stock climbed 5.9% to 16.52.For the fourth quarter, Fitbit earned 35 cents a share, excluding items, on sales of $712 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Fitbit to earn 25 cents a share ex items on sales of $648 million in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales jumped 92%, and non-GAAP earnings per share rose 67%.But for the current quarter, Fitbit is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 1 cent on sales of $430 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling earnings of 23 cents a share on sales of $485 million in Q1.Fitbit Chief Financial Officer Bill Zerella told IBD that Q1 is a product-transition quarter, with the company launching its Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband in March, while discontinuing the Fitbit Charge.“Literally, a few weeks makes a difference,” he said. “We stopped shipping the Fitbit Charge, and the channel has been draining all of its inventory levels in preparation for the Alta.”The company will incur higher sales and marketing expenses this quarter as it launches the Alta and Blaze globally. Plus, Fitbit will see additional manufacturing expenses in Q1 as it seeks to maximize production of the new products, the company said in a press release.Fitbit’s full-year guidance is more indicative of the company’s outlook, Zerella said.For 2016, Fitbit expects to earn $1.14 per share minus items on sales of $2.45 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. The EPS goal is in line with the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The sales goal is slightly higher than the $2.42 billion forecast by Wall Street.Preorders for the Blaze and Alta are exceeding the company's forecasts in both devices and attach rates for accessories, such as swappable wristbands, Zerella said.Another positive for Fitbit is companies buying activity trackers for employees as part of corporate wellness programs, he said. Fitbit added 1,000 new enterprise customers to its corporate wellness platform in Q4. Unit orders from enterprise customers can range from 500 for small and medium companies up to retailer Target (TGT) buying devices for all of its 330,000 employees.San Francisco-based Fitbit leads the wearable fitness tracker space, but it's facing heightened competition. For instance, Garmin (GRMN) on Friday announced two new fitness wearables that are slated to ship in the second quarter.Other competitors include Apple (AAPL), Fossil (FOSL), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).Fitbit ended 2015 with 16.9 million active users, up more than 150% from 6.7 million at the end of 2014. It added 18 million new registered device users in 2015, of which 13 million, or 72%, were active users at year-end. It ended the year with 29 million registered device users. Fitbit sold 8.2 million connected health and fitness devices in Q4. The U.S. accounted for 75% of Q4 revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 12% of sales. The Asia Pacific region contributed 8% of sales.“Much of our success is due to the power and size of our user community,” James Park, Fitbit co-founder and CEO, said on the company's conference call with analysts. “People are more likely to buy our products because their friends and family are already users. And they’re less likely to leave to a competitive ecosystem due to the same dynamics. This is a powerful competitive moat for our business.”

1263,GRMN,"Stocks wrestled in and out of narrowly mixed territory early Thursday, as rising oil, mixed economic data and earnings news all factored into opening trade.The Dow hashed back and forth, in and out of narrow gains. The Nasdaq slipped 0.4% as Discovery Communications (DISCA), Dish Network (DISH) and Garmin (GRMN) all dragged on the index. The S&P 500 shed 0.2%.Volume moved lower, down 14% on the Nasdaq and off 9% on the NYSE, relative to trade at the same time Wednesday.  Lighter volume can signal that institutional investors are not significantly active.The stock market today felt some early push from overseas markets, with benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Tokyo closing more than 2% higher. But Europe's markets backed away from early gains and turned mixed in afternoon trade following the start of U.S. markets.A positive reading on weekly jobless claims also aided opening action.

Earnings and revenue missed analyst consensus estimates, and management significantly pared the top end of its full-year EPS guidance. The stock had been correcting, rising briefly above its 10-week line since August.Among IBD 50 stocks, Universal Display (OLED) rumbled up almost 4% in strong trade – working on a seventh straight advance. The move positioned shares for a test of resistance at their 50-day moving average after retaking support at their 200-day line on Wednesday.Turf tending equipment maker Toro (TTC) bolted 4% higher in heavy action. That sent shares into buying range above a 75.22 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.At the low end of the list, Five Below (FIVE) dropped 3%, pulling back in light trade after a six-day rally. The slip put shares back below a 36.59 buy point in a cup with handle base.

1265,GRMN,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsShares of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) dropped to their lowest level ever on Monday, following a rough week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Fitbit stock was down nearly 12%, near 18, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Francisco-based company went public last June at 20. Monday marked the first time that Fitbit had fallen below its IPO price.Fitbit stock crumbled last week at the annual CES trade show. First, it disappointed investors with the introduction of the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch, which drew comparisons to Apple'S (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch. Then it faced a slew of new products from competitors both new, such as Under Armour (UA) and New Balance, and old, like Garmin (GRMN).Baird analyst William Power on Monday slashed his price target on Fitbit stock to 30 from 54.""Fitbit unveiled its new product, the Fitbit Blaze, which, while sporting solid functionality, was panned by many for its design and potentially greater competition with Apple Watch,"" Power said. ""The company is betting that the device should drive incremental sales in addition to providing a natural upgrade patch for current Charge HR users. The device should benefit Q1 sell-in, though sell-through will be key.""Power says he expects Fitbit to post strong Q4 earnings results, but he says the company will face difficult year-over-year comparisons in early 2016. Fitbit also faces investor concerns over increased competition and the positioning of the Fitbit Blaze, he says.""On the other hand, Fitbit should continue to benefit from ongoing fitness trends along with longer-term digital heath secular trends,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy remained positive on Fitbit in a [PAGE[research]] note Friday. She rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 60.The Fitbit Blaze is likely to support three favorable trends for Fitbit: increased retail store space, higher portfolio average selling prices and improved gross margins, she says. The new smart fitness watch also could expand the total addressable market for Fitibit's products, she says.RELATED: Fitbit CEO says retailers, consumers excited for Blaze watch

1266,GRMN,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) on Wednesday expanded its product portfolio with a fashionable new fitness wristband called the Fitbit Alta.Fitbit began taking pre-orders for the device, which sells for $129.95, on Wednesday, with retail availability starting in March in North America.Alta activity trackers feature stylish, interchangeable bands in a range of colors and materials. Extra bands in Fitbit's ""classic"" style cost $29.95 each. It's also selling luxe leather bands for $59.95 apiece and stainless steel bands for $99.95. Plus, Fitbit is working with designer Tory Burch on fashion accessories for the Alta.In addition to tracking regular activity, exercise and sleep, the Fitbit Alta includes reminders to move when you’ve been sitting too long and smartphone notifications of calls, texts and appointments. Fitbit Alta has a five-day battery life.The Alta provides personal pep talks and motivation, with on-screen messages to meet mini-goals like 250 steps per hour. It tracks steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned and active minutes. It automatically recognizes when someone is exercising.Users can track their progress with a smartphone app and online tools.The Fitbit Alta ultimately will replace the Fitbit Charge, but not the Charge HR, which measures heart rate.“Alta is going to be the premier product for the biggest segment of the market, which is everyday fitness,” Woody Scal, Fitbit’s chief business officer, told IBD. “We think this will broaden our addressable market significantly by bringing in people who care a little bit more about style.”From a business perspective, Alta provides Fitbit the opportunity to sell more high-margin accessories. That’s also a focus with the upcoming Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch.Plus, the Alta provides an upgrade path for owners of Fitbit Flex devices, Scal said.“Fitbit is more than just cool stuff on your wrist or clipped to your waist,” he said.Fitbit has differentiated itself by focusing on software and building a platform for providing personalized fitness insights and coaching as well as social and motivational tools, Scal said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on Wednesday reiterated her overweight rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 60. Fitbit stock was down 1% to about 16 in midday trading on the stock market today.The Alta “combines a higher level of fashion and functionality at the sweet spot of pricing,” Murphy said in a report. Fitbit launched its latest device in tandem with New York Fashion Week.“The infusion of fashion in their product should aid the company to convert retail consumers and help drive a product upgrade cycle,” Murphy said.Fitbit competes with a host of companies, including Fossil (FOSL), Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Given Physical, Passes With Outperform Rating.

1267,GRMN,"Teens have worshipped at the altar of Nike (NKE) since the mid-1980s, helping it become a $31 billion powerhouse. But Under Armour (UA) is rolling out wearables and powering its app with AI to hardwire the next generation of believers to its brand.Some type of smart technology will eventually be in all Under Armour products, Chief Digital Officer Robin Thurston told Investor's Business Daily. That might mean biometrics, a tool that tells users how long a product should last or something that kicks off a smartphone app.But either way, Under Armour believes sensors and data collection will be among the needs of tomorrow's athletes.“For the first 20 years (of the company’s history), it was about changing the way athletes dress, and we fundamentally believe that the next 20 years are going to be about changing the way athletes live,” said Thurston. “And technology is going to play a massive part in that.”The Baltimore-based sportswear maker, which reports earnings on Thursday, launched a range of smart gadgets at CES earlier this month, including wireless headphones, connected running shoes and the UA HealthBox -- a kit with a heart-rate monitor, fitness tracker and scale.Those devices connect to the upgraded UA Record app, which can provide personalized insights like the best time of day to work out, with help from IBM’s (IBM) Watson supercomputer.Such tech efforts may seem odd for a company that sells compression shirts and athletic footwear, particularly when the field is already populated by Apple (AAPL) Watch, Fitbit (FIT), Jawbone, Garmin (GRMN) and other fitness trackers.But today's workout junkie is very different from the spandex-clad aerobics enthusiast of yesteryear. Younger people tend to take more classes instead of working out alone and enjoy sharing their experiences on social media, said Matt Powell, NPD Group’s sports industry analyst.""The millennial consumer is very social when it comes to their fitness activities, as opposed to the older consumer ... who would lift some weights and leave without talking to anyone,"" Powell told IBD.Under Armour hasn’t been shy about its quest to essentially become the Facebook (FB) of fitness. The UA Record app allows users to share their workout goals and accomplishments with others online, as well as follow the feeds of Under Armour endorsers like ballerina Misty Copeland or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Amid the fast-growing industry of fitness tech, developing an emotional bond with future customers while they’re young is crucial.“All of this is positioning (Under Armour) for something that is five to 10 years away,” said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser. “When those kids grow up and then the technology moves along, then it all comes together even more.”But for now, Nike is still far and away the top brand among the adolescent set, according to Piper Jaffray’s latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Over a quarter of respondents called Nike their No. 1 clothing brand, and half said it is their favorite footwear brand.Under Armour is also on the radar of both teens and kids. Children's shoe sales spiked 103% in 2015 vs. 62% growth in men’s and 69% growth in women’s footwear, said Poser, citing SportScanInfo data.Yet not everyone is convinced that Under Armour’s move into gadgetry is quite so necessary.""I commend (Under Armour) for taking this approach, but we are getting in a space where Apple and Google play in,"" said Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu. ""And these companies have the best technology guys.""Under Armour isn’t exactly going solo; it has a partnership with HTC to make its wearables. But perhaps as an indicator of how difficult going it alone can be, Nike shuttered its wearables development in 2014 and -- outside of an ongoing partnership with Apple -- doesn’t appear to be planning a connected-product launch anytime soon.Still, Nike’s hardware pullback shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a retreat from fitness tracking. That it isn’t pushing wearables could be a sign of a deepened relationship with Apple, Vasilescu said.Ultimately, to capture the younger workout crowd, Under Armour might have to do more than stuff their gear with chips -- it will have to cultivate the same kind of must-have feeling that Apple products inspire.Poser thinks the brand’s apparel already has that sort of appeal. But for its new tech gear, he said Under Armour must find a way to convince people that ""this is good, you gotta have it, the same way people have to have the new iPhone.""To be sure, Under Armour's push into heart-rate monitors and smarter apps is all in service of an oft-repeated goal: Don’t forget to sell shirts and shoes. And many shoppers are younger people, particularly younger people who want a holistic, data-centered view of their day-to-day activities.""Sixty-five percent of the (Connected Fitness) audience is under 40,"" said Under Armour’s Thurston. ""They’re tech savvy. They’ve kind of raised their hand and said, 'I want to quantify at some level,' whether that’s food tracking or activity tracking or logging workouts. ... We think there’s hundreds of millions of people out there that still need these products.""RELATED:

1269,GRMN,"The annual CES consumer technology trade show, which officially kicks off on Wednesday in Las Vegas, will see self-driving cars, virtual reality, wearables, drones and hoverboards making headlines.Attendance at CES, originally named the Consumer Electronics Show (and still called that by many), for the first time will be capped, at about 176,000, over its four-day run. It will feature more than 3,600 exhibitors blanketing over 2.4 million net square feet, according to the Consumer Technology Association, which runs the show.CTA pegged last year's attendance at 176,676, with about 3,600 exhibitors using some 2.2 million net square feet. The show's attendance first topped 100,000 in 2000, and exhibition space first topped 1.5 million square feet in 2005. It's by far the largest U.S. tech trade show.This year's show boasts keynote speeches from Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra and IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, among others.Cars Star And China ArrivesAutomakers will have a huge presence at CES 2016, as they tout electric cars, collision-avoidance and other safety systems, connected cars and autonomous vehicles.In addition to GM, Ford Motor (F), Kia Motors, Toyota Motor (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) will be holding events at the show. Also, companies developing technologies for self-driving cars will be presenting at CES, including Bosch, Valeo and Mobileye (MBLY).Plus, intelligent electric-car startup Faraday Future will unveil its first concept car at a pre-show event.Several car companies got a jump on the show with announcements Monday.GM announced a long-term strategic alliance with ride-sharing operator Lyft to create a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles. Lyft rival Uber also is working on self-driving car technology.Car companies also are adding more Internet connectivity and smart entertainment systems to future vehicles.Ford said Monday it will add Apple (AAPL) CarPlay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android Auto, along with 4G LTE connectivity, to millions of new vehicles.Toyota said it is accelerating its connected car technology initiatives, including building a Toyota Big Data Center. Toyota also entered a pact with Ford and Livio to start an industry framework using Livio's SmartDeviceLink as the open-source platform for smartphone apps and car connectivity.CES 2016 will see a changing of the guard as Chinese consumer electronics firms rise in stature and once-prominent Japanese companies fade.CTA lists more than 1,200 exhibitors from China, with Changhong, Haier, Hisense, Huawei, TCL and ZTE among the largest. In fact, a third of the exhibitors at this year's show are China-based.Meanwhile, Japanese electronics firms like Panasonic and Sony (SNE) have shrunk their presence at the show, and Sharp and Toshiba are no long exhibiting in the central hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center.""Make no mistake — the Chinese have arrived,"" Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said in a pre-CES blog post. ""They plan to disrupt the traditional CE players as much as possible and take market share away from them fast.""Wearables And DronesLast year's breakout stars at CES were wearables and drones. Both of those categories will have a larger presence this year.Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, said she is ""blown away"" by the number of companies showing wearable devices at the show. These gadgets are moving away from simple fitness apps like tracking heart rate and steps taken to measuring everything from body aches to the wearer's emotional state.The wearables market leader, Fitbit (FIT), is expected to unveil several new fitness bands with new sensors for measuring such things as skin temperature and heart rate variability. Fitbit also might take on Garmin (GRMN) with a running watch, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a pre-CES research note.In drones, a host of new competitors will join market leaders DJI and Parrot with their own flying cameras at the show. GoPro's (GPRO) highly anticipated Karma is not expected to be among them, though.Intel said Monday that it is buying German drone maker Ascending Technologies for an undisclosed price, Re/code reported.Consumers showed a great deal of interest in drones this holiday shopping season, but Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin is skeptical about longer-term prospects for the category.The mainstream use case for drones is ""questionable,"" he told IBD. ""You can clearly add a new dimension to your picture-taking if you know what you're doing.""However, the appeal of taking selfies from the air might be limited, he said. Plus, government restrictions on where you can fly drones threaten to keep the devices ""pretty grounded.""What's Hot For CES 2016?Among the products likely to capture the attention of the media at CES 2016 are virtual reality and augmented reality headsets, the first ultra-high-definition Blu-ray Disc players, self-driving cars, hoverboards and other personal transportation devices.With the planned launches of three VR headsets in early 2016, virtual reality will be a big topic at CES. The VR goggles include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift, Sony's PlayStation VR and the HTC-Valve joint venture HTC Vive.Facebook: Your VR Is ReadyOculus announced Monday that it will begin taking pre-orders for its Rift VR goggles on Wednesday. It did not reveal pricing for the headset or say when the device will ship. The goggles will come bundled with video games ""Lucky's Tale"" by Playful and ""Eve: Valkyrie"" from CCP.Many companies at CES will be showing off cameras for taking 360-degree video for playing on those headsets. Video game makers and entertainment companies will be there to tout content for VR goggles. Still others are making peripherals for VR gaming such as gloves and controllers.""The big buzz heading into CES 2016 is around 'rolling out the red carpet' for virtual reality products/headsets/software,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in his CES preview research note.""After years of development, the tech world will be getting its first glimpse of the highly anticipated virtual reality systems set to hit the consumer market in first-half 2016,"" he said.Bajarin expects virtual reality will be a big deal. ""It really represents the next big step in immersive computing,"" he said.But Costello isn't sold on VR for applications beyond gaming.""Wearing goggles and watching TV is not what people want to do. We had that problem with 3D TV,"" she said.The latest television displays are always a highlight at CES. This year, with 4K Ultra HD TVs hitting mainstream prices, attention is shifting to a technology called HDR or high dynamic range. HDR offers a better contrast ratio and more accurate color, for a more realistic picture.Consumer electronics vendors and Hollywood studios will be at CES to promote the first Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc players. They hope that Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs can revitalize the packaged media business by providing a better picture than you can get from streaming, Costello said.Skateboard Meets SegwayOne product likely to make the blooper reels for TV journalists at CES are so-called hoverboards. The self-balancing two-wheeled boards for personal transportation were a hit over the holiday season. But the devices gained notoriety for defects that caused some to catch fire. There also have been many videos posted online of people falling off the boards and injuring themselves.The category will need quality-control improvements to remain popular, Bajarin said.""I do think there is value to them once you get the kinks out of them,"" he said. ""You're going to see some exceptional new hoverboards at the show.""

1270,GRMN,"Fitbit (FIT) is laps ahead of the competition in the wearable fitness tracker market. But the San Francisco-based company still faces risks such as the possibility of waning interest in the category and greater competition from smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) Watch.For now, Fitbit is standing tall, even if its stock isn't.On Friday, Mizuho Securities analyst Betty Chen initiated coverage of Fitbit with a buy rating and a price target of 38. Fitbit closed down 0.3% at 27.73 on the stock market today. Fitbit went public on June 18 at 20 and reached as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5.""We believe Fitbit has the first-mover advantage in the rapidly growing smart wearables/fitness tracker market and should continue to see market share gains given: 1) growing global demand in health and fitness; 2) strong brand recognition; 3) open platform that promotes community and engagement; and 4) a multipronged growth opportunity from consumer to corporate,"" Chen said in a report.Fitbit has opportunities to expand both domestically and internationally, she said.A survey this month by Mizuho found that 56% of people who own fitness trackers have Fitbit devices. And among people planning to buy fitness trackers, 59% chose Fitbit as their preferred brand.Garmin (GRMN) was a distant second in ownership (8%) and purchase intent (11%).But Mizuho's consumer surveys found that interest in buying fitness trackers declined between September and December. Asked if they planned to purchase a fitness tracker, 4.3% of respondents said yes and 16% said maybe in a December poll, vs. 4.5% yes and 26.3% maybe in the September poll.People who own fitness trackers use them mostly for tracking steps (70.9%), exercise tracking and coaching (41.7%), and tracking sleep (28.1%), the latest Mizuho survey found.Chen said that she is not concerned for now about smartwatches cannibalizing the fitness tracker market. Mizuho's surveys show lackluster smartwatch adoption so far, she said.One bright spot for the activity tracker market is the rise of corporate wellness programs. The corporate wellness industry in the U.S. alone is expected to grow from $7.4 billion in 2014 to $11.3 billion by 2019,business research firm IBISWorld reports. More companies are giving employees activity trackers to monitor their health and negotiate better insurance premiums. Corporate sales today represent about 8% of Fitbit's revenue, Chen said. 
"
1271,GRMN,"Sales of Fitbit (FIT)activity trackers got off to a slow start over the Black Friday weekend but have picked up considerably as Christmas approaches, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Checks indicate Fitbit's in-store demand came back in a big way since our Black Friday checks indicated disappointing sell-through a few weeks ago,"" Erickson said. ""We believe the company is tracking to Q4 upside with one-third of Best Buy (BBY)stores struggling to keep Charge HRs in stock.""Fitbit continues to dominate the wearable fitness tracker category and may have picked up market share this quarter, Erickson said. Other makers of wearable devices includingGarmin (GRMN) and Apple (AAPL) have discounted their devices this season, but not Fitbit, he said.""We were fairly well bombarded with emails on Cyber Monday and after from Best Buy and others noting holiday weekend discounts on wearables continuing throughout the week. Fitbit, however, was noticeably absent from this group, which we took as a good sign,"" he said.Erickson reiterated his overweight rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 47. Fitbit stock was up nearly 3% to about 28.50 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy noted Monday that Fitbit products have moved up the Amazon.com (AMZN) sales ranks in recent weeks.""We remain positive on Fitbit and see strong conversion throughout the holiday season,"" Murphy said in a report. ""While pricing has been down (in the) 5-10% range over the past weeks, recall Fitbit doesn't fund discounting outside of Black Friday. More importantly, we have seen Fitbit materially rise in the rankings. The brand now makes up seven of the top 10 items in (the Amazon sports and fitness) category.""She rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 60. 
"
1272,GRMN,"A survey of athletes, mostly runners, finds that Garmin (GRMN) is running away from the pack in terms of sports watch ownership and fitness app usage. But in the fitness band category, Fitbit (FIT) is the leader.Piper Jaffray surveyed 221 athletes across 16 states in November for the firm's second annual athletic and connected fitness survey. Of those surveyed, 95% said running is their No. 1 sport.Some 91% of respondents said they wear a watch when running, and Garmin is the top brand with 70% market share. Also, 19% wear a fitness band (up from 14% last year), with Fitbit the leader at 73% market share, Piper Jaffray said Wednesday.The survey revealed that 55% of respondents use a fitness app to monitor their exercise, vs. 49% last year. The top three fitness apps are Garmin Connect, Strava and Under Armour (UA)-owned MapMyFitness. Fitbit's app came in fifth after MyFitnessPal, another app owned by Under Armour.Fitbit increased its market share among athletes who own fitness bands to 73% from 64% last year. Garmin jumped to second place with a 24% share of fitness band ownership among athletes, vs. 9% and third place last year. Nike (NKE) came in second last year with a 14% share, but it didn't make the top three this year because it exited the hardware business in 2014.The general trends of increased ownership of fitness bands and fitness app usage bode well for Fitbit, Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a report Wednesday. She reiterated her overweight rating and price target of 60 on Fitbit stock. Fitbit fell 3.4% to 31.25 in the stock market today, a down day for major stock indexes.One area that saw a decrease in the latest survey is intent to buy fitness bands. The survey found that 6% of respondents plan to buy a fitness band over the next six months, compared with 16% in the year-earlier survey. Meanwhile, 5% of respondents said they plan to buy Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch, the Apple Watch, in the next six months.In the sports watch category, Garmin increased its market share to 70% this year from 65% in fall 2014. Timex remained in second with 14% share, down from 17% a year earlier.

Growth will be driven by robust demand for f??nix watch series.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Outdoor segment revenues is pegged at $172 million.Fitness The Fitness segment decreased 15% year over year and the decline is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter due to persistent low volumes in basic activity trackers.

Investors were already feeling hopeful about GoPro’sprospects, after the company reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2017 recently.Last Thursday, the action camera maker said it expects to be profitable on an adjusted basis in third-quarter 2017, which catapulted its shares up nearly 17%. Its shares are now back in the double digits, which was not the case for the better part of a year.In fact, GoPro’s shares have appreciated 20.3% in the past three months, outperforming the industry average of 7.4%. The analyst community has also been showing favor toward the stock in recent times, with estimates being revised north sharply. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings narrowed from a loss of 16 cents to a loss of 3 cents per share over the past 60 days, led by three upward revisions versus one downward.Facts & FiguresPer the latest information, GoPro now anticipates revenues and gross margin for the third quarter to come in at the higher end of its previous guidance. Just last month, the company released the said outlook, concurrent with its second-quarter results, which called for third-quarter revenues in the range of $290-$310 million, with gross margin coming in between 36-38%.GoPro had earlier expected to report a loss of 1-11 cents in the third quarter on an adjusted basis.The company also affirmed that its plans to launch the Hero 6 (the latest edition of its flagship action cameras) and the new Fusion 360 camera by the holiday season were perfectly on track.GoPro will likely officially release its third-quarter results in early November. But the quarter ends in a few weeks (on Sep 30), so it's heartening to know that GoPro has seen enough this quarter to make such a confident forecast.Focusing Through the LensGoPro's cameras might have a massive following among action junkies, but its sales have taken a thorough beating in recent quarters, after a series of missteps.On the face of it, things seem to have turned around for the better for GoPro, and the stock is showing signs of life too. Still, the company has lost money in six of the last seven quarters, and investors need to dig a little deeper to glean whether the improvement is sustainable.The action camera market is still grappling with serious demand issues and ever-increasing competition. GoPro's shares have slumped nearly 70% in the last couple of years, as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product launches, and lost ground to competitors like Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report), and Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report).In fact, the company is likely on track for its third consecutive year of margin compression, and this does not bode well for its bottom line. In the recently reported second-quarter results, its gross margins contracted a whopping 650 basis points year over year.Also, GoPro’s inventory levels have been causing serious hiccups over the last couple of years. Excessive inventory is not good for either new releases or retailers. So, management recently decided to revert to its old system of limiting releases, regardless of whether demand exceeds supply. This sets up the company for leaner channels and better inventory levels, and bodes well for GoPro’s upcoming product launches as well.Also, the fact remains that sales really have rebounded after the release of HERO5 in the fourth quarter of last year. If the market was truly saturated or the company was losing market share amid such intense competition, GoPro would have seen a persistent decline in sales.The upcoming holiday season will serve as the true test for the company, and will determine whether GoPro's management will be able to right the ship and return the company to profitability. Notably, this will be the first holiday season in which the Karma Drone will be fully available, after the recall disaster last season.In order to restore investor confidence, GoPro will need a series of strong quarters — and this means no operational glitches, sub-par guidance, production delays or messed-up product roll outs.We currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on GoPro.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1901,GRMN,"On Thursday, shares of wearable action camera maker GoPro Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) are soaring, up over 14% in morning trading after the company updated its third quarter guidance.GoPro said that it now expects revenue and gross margin to be at the high end of its previously expected ranges, with Q3 revenues coming in between $290 million to $310 million and gross margin between 36% to 38%. GoPro also forecasts adjusted profitability for the quarter.In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” GoPro Chief Operating Officer CJ Porber said that ""We set some stretch forecasts at the beginning of the year to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for all of 2017 and post double-digit revenue growth. And we expect to do that.”“The bigger picture even beyond this quarter is that we’re seeing really strong consumer demand for our products and were successfully turning the business around,” he continued.Since October, GPRO has fallen almost 50% due to investor skepticism and broad concerns that the company is losing ground to smartphones and similar devices from competitors like Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Sony (SNE  -  Free Report). On top of this, the delay in the launch of its much-hyped Karma drone and production issues with its Hero 5 camera negatively affected sales and put unwanted pressure on GoPro’s stock.However, GoPro did say it is still on track to launch the Hero 6, which is the latest edition of its flagship action cameras, in addition to the company’s new Fusion 360 camera, by the upcoming holiday season.GoPro In-DepthSince its June 2014 IPO, GoPro has undoubtedly struggled. While the stock jumped nearly 31% on its first day of trading, and soon hit an all-time high of almost $94 per share just a few months after, GoPro shares have lost roughly 90% of its value since then (as of Wednesday’s close).GPRO is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Along with its updated third quarter guidance, GoPro expects earnings growth for current year of over 97% and sales growth of 12.6% in the same time frame. From a growth perspective, the company looks promising, though perhaps it’s because GoPro has finally worked out some major production issues.GoPro’s valuation, however, is tricky, and because it has suffered a long bout of losses, it currently has no price-to-earnings. Looking at the camera maker’s price-to-sales ratio, GoPro sits at 0.97, which matches the Audio Video Production industry’s P/S.Based on P/S, GoPro’s value has significantly cheapened, steadily decreasing since it hit its all-time high about three years ago. Its guidance announcement today is a step in the right direction, especially after its smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss, to boosting profits, increasing sales, and regaining some of its value back.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1902,GRMN,"Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has entered the race for buying Toshiba Corp.'s chip unit at the eleventh hour. Per reports, Apple has been roped in by a consortium led by Bain Capital to strengthen its offer for the Japanese conglomerate’s lucrative chip business.In June, Bain Capital along with Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) and Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) reportedly submitted a fresh bid of 2.1 trillion yen (approximately $19 billion).It is reported that Apple will inject around ¥400bn (possibly upfront) while South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix and Bain will provide about ¥1.1 trillion with Toshiba’s banks supplying the remaining funds.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Interested in Toshiba?Notably, Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker, a technology that is now preferred over legacy hard-drive storage systems due to speed and reliability. Apple sources flash memory for iPhone and iPods from Toshiba.Analysts observe that by acquiring Toshiba’s chip business, Apple can not only reduce its dependence on Samsung but also maintain competitive pricing. Bloomberg quoted Michael Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, saying “There are supply shortages of that type of memory. They’re always looking to work closely with key suppliers and lock in long-term supply agreements.”Toshiba Fails to Meet Creditors’ DeadlineAt its board meeting held on Thursday morning, Toshiba failed to arrive at any consensus, thereby failing to meet the deadline set by its creditors’ to sell its chip business. Reportedly, in a statement, Toshiba’s board said “While Toshiba exercised its best efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory definitive agreement with one of the consortia seeking to purchase TMC, the negotiations with each consortium have not reached the point which will allow Toshiba's Board of Directors to make a decision.”The chip unit, which Toshiba values at 2 trillion yen, has attracted a number of suitors. With many backing out including Broadcom (AVGO), Toshiba at present is considering three offers, per media reports.One is the abovementioned Bain consortium-led offer. The second bid is led by Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report). Now Western Digital’s division SanDisk and Toshiba jointly run a flash memory factory in Japan. The two have been at loggerheads over the sale of the chip business for quite some time now.Citing the joint venture (JV) agreement, Western Digital insists that it has the rights to approve/disapprove any transaction that involves the JV. However, Toshiba counterclaimed that the JV agreement doesn’t give the right to either party to block the other from selling its share. It also pointed out that Western Digital bought SanDisk without seeking or receiving Toshiba’s approval. There continues to be high level tension between the companies with claims, counterclaims and arbitrations involved.Western Digital is looking to get its hands on the memory business as it will strengthen Western Digital’s competitive position in the profitable NAND flash memory market.The final bid is from a group of buyers, which includes Taiwanese electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, parent company of Foxconn. Chances of Hon Hai striking the deal are relatively low due to its significant presence in China. This is not going to go down well with the Japanese government.Toshiba is in a awful situation. The company needs to raise capital to remain a listed entity. Currently, the company has negative shareholder’s equity after it posted a colossal loss of 950 billion yen (almost $8.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March. Most of the loss stemmed from write-downs pertaining to its now-defunct Westinghouse nuclear business.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in a year. Shares of Apple have surged 54% compared with the industry’s 52.3% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Garmin Ltd.

Though iPhone 8 is slated for release this year, the majority of shipments are “likely to land early in 2018” according to IDC.Talking about the overall smartphone market, IDC stated that shipments will increase over 1.7 billion in 2021 from 1.47 billion at the end of 2016. The five-year CAGR will be around 3.3% driven by new users as well as the standard two-year replacement cycle. IDC estimates that the smartphone market has ample room to grow as about 50% of the world’s population has not started using smartphones yet.More importantly, average selling price of premium devices (with large screens) will increase 9% by 2021 driven by high-end mobile phones like iPhone 8, Note 8, V30 and more.Apple Inc.

But despite the relatively low market share, Apple will command 36% of the device market in dollar terms (equaling $180 million), representing “over half the combined value of all Android OEMs combined”, adds IDC.As for 2017, iPhone shipments are expected to increase 1.5% against 7% decline registered in 2016.In the past few days, there has been strong speculation that Apple will host its product announcement event on Sep 12. Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings, which start retailing a week after the event.Reportedly, at this year’s event, Apple will be announcing three new phones. iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year. In addition to these, a mega edition, dubbed as iPhone 8, will likely be introduced to the world, per reports.For some time now, Apple’s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all. Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8.

1909,GRMN,"Per media reports, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) and prominent Hollywood studios are at loggerheads over pricing of 4K content. This is highly concerning as Apple is expected to unveil its 4K and HDR streaming capable Apple TV at its Sep 12 event.Reportedly, Apple wants to charge $20 for selling ultrahigh-definition movies on its new Apple TV. But studios want Apple to charge higher (say another $5 to $10) for selling the movies on iTunes. The studios argue that given the improvement in visual quality, it is not right to price ultra HD and full HD content at the same level.At present, on an average, a consumer has to shell out $30 for watching any Ultra HD content across various platforms. Apple’s aggressive pricing could help it to gain market share but for the movie studios this is a tough deal as it will dent their profits, observe analysts. As a result, negotiations remain held up. There has been no official comment from Apple on the matter.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple TV was launched in Jan 2007. It is a digital media player and HDMI compliant set top device that needs to be connected to TV to work. Apple TV also gives access to Apple’s iTunes content as well as some third party content.However, with increasing competition in the space, Apple TV has started to lose ground to Roku and Amazon. Per a Verge report, citing a survey by Parks Associates, while Roku’s market share, in the first quarter of 2017, jumped from 33% to 37%, Apple’s share has shrunk to 15% from 19% reported last year. A heftily priced Apple TV ($150 to $200) compared to Roku’s $30 priced hardware is definitely a major factor for the declining market share, adds the report. Even Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Fire TV Box costs around $80 while a Fire Stick comes in as cheap as $40.Though there is a lot of buzz surrounding Apple’s 4K TV, it is to be noted that the market already has many devices that already offer 4K resolution and that too at a cheaper price. Plus, 4K Apple TV needs a 4K TV to work with. 4K TVs haven’t yet gone mainstream. Most people still stuck with the usual HD and LED TVs.Will Apple find success with new Apple TV? It remains a wait and see story.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in a year. Shares of Apple have surged 53.5% compared with the industry’s 51.9% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Garmin Ltd.

1910,GRMN,"It seems that Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) is on track to unveil its latest iPhone right before the holiday season.Per media reports, Apple will host its product announcement event on Sep 12. Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings, which start retailing a week after the event.Reportedly, at this year’s event, Apple will be announcing three new phones. iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year. In addition to these, a mega edition, widely labeled as iPhone 8, will likely be introduced to the world, per reports.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s Mega iPhone For some time now, Apple’s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all. Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8. The phone is rumored to have features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.Reportedly, iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind to support OLED display. Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are fast catching up now.The revolutionary iPhone released first in June 2007 had changed the world forever. The iPhone was the first phone to have a touch screen and was a ""breakthrough internet device"".  The original iPhone was powered by an ARM-based 1176JZ (F)-S processor and had a PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip. It had a 1400mAH battery.Upon release, the phone received a terrific response. Following that, the success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Apple has sold over a billion iPhones across the globe. However, over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo.Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared to the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 826% while the industry saw a rally of 382.3%.Delay Rumors Losing FizzLast month, it was widely reported that there could be a delay in the launch as the company faces technological issues involving fingerprint and 3D sensors. Consequently, analysts had lowered their iPhone shipment expectations for the quarter ending September.Expectations regarding the upcoming iPhone 8 are humongous, as it will mark the tenth anniversary of the first iPhone. Analysts have already dubbed sales of iPhone 8 as a “super cycle.” Hence, any delay can severely impact Apple’s quarterly results.The latest developments assuage concerns regarding a delay in the launch to a great extent. Per a Barron’s report, “the consensus sales estimate for Apple’s fiscal year ending September 2018 has climbed to 247 million units from 239 million since the end of March. That would mark 14% growth from the current fiscal year.”Also, Apple had given an upbeat guidance along with its third quarter fiscal 2017 results for the quarter ending in September, thereby widely alleviating fears of a delay in the launch of the next edition iPhone. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company forecasts revenues in a range of $49–$52 billion compared with $46.9 billion reported in the year-ago quarter when it released iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.Plus, if we go by Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) recent results, reported a couple of days back, the concerns are further mitigated. Broadcom supplies chips for iPhones. The company recently reported better-than-expected third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company’s Wireless Communications (28.7% of total revenue) revenues were up 27.3% year over year and 11.6% quarter over quarter to $1.28 billion.Broadcom’s top line benefited from the rise in production volumes of the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone). Management noted that increase in total dollar content in the upcoming platform drove revenues.Further, management noted that Wireless Communications revenues are expected to grow strongly in the fourth quarter, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. The upside is likely to be driven by higher dollar content in the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s next-gen platform. This implies that iPhone 8 will be up for sale in September.Will Price Prove to be a Deterrent to Sales?Nonetheless, it is the price point that might prove to be an impediment as observed by various analysts. Reportedly, iPhone 8 could be priced more than $1,000 dollars. Many analysts argue that the existing iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with iPhone. The power of Apple’s fan base cannot be undermined.Other Things to Watch Out For at the EventApart from the new iPhones, per media reports, Apple could launch a new Apple watch. Then there could a new Apple 4K TV. Apple is likely to speak at length about iOS 11 and new MacOS and watchOS.At the WWDC earlier this year, Apple gave a sneak peek into its AR efforts. The company also displayed an augmented reality (AR) tool called ARKit. We expect more on this at the September event along with HomePod.At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Garmin Ltd.

1913,GRMN,"It seems that investors are feeling better about GoPro, Inc.’s (GPRO  -  Free Report) prospects, after the company reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2017 recently, considering the sharply rising share price of the company.The action camera maker’s bottom-line figure crushed expectations in the recently reported quarter, as GoPro’s adjusted loss of 14 cents trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 34 cents by a whopping 58.8%. It seems that the company’s substantial cost-cutting initiatives were highly successful in stemming its earnings decline.In addition, the company posted better-than-expected revenue numbers for the quarter and reduced its operating expenses significantly. GoPro surprised investors with its sales figures, as its quarterly revenues grew an impressive 34.3% from the prior-year quarter tally to $296.5 million. The revenue growth was fueled by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras, Karma growth and strong accessory revenue.This marked the company’s third consecutive quarter of revenue growth after four successive quarters of sales declines.On the face of it, things seem to have turned around for the better for GoPro, and the stock is showing signs of life too. Still, the company lost money in six of the last seven quarters, and investors need to dig a little deeper to glean whether the improvement is sustainable.The action camera market is still grappling with serious demand issues and ever-increasing competition. Players like Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report), Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report), and several others have entered the market, which is turn is evidently contracting GoPro's margins.In fact, the company is likely on track for its third consecutive year of margin compression, and this does not bode well for its bottom line. In the second-quarter results, its gross margins contracted a whopping 650 basis points year over year.GoPro’s negative cash generation has also been worrisome of late. Net cash used in operating activities rose 89.7% year over year in the last reported quarter.Also, GoPro’s inventory levels have been causing serious hiccups over the last couple of years. Excessive inventory is not good for either new releases or retailers. So, management decided to revert to its old system of limiting releases, regardless of whether demand exceeds supply. This sets the company up for leaner channels and better inventory levels.In the second quarter, we witnessed that GoPro’s focus on improving inventory and channel management resulted in a 39% reduction in inventory sequentially, and forward weeks of supply in the channel are down 25%. This bodes well for GoPro’s upcoming product launches.Also, the fact remains that sales really have rebounded after the release of HERO5 in the fourth quarter of last year. If the market was truly saturated or the company was losing market share amid such intense competition, GoPro would have seen a persistent decline in sales.The upcoming holiday season will serve as the true test for the company, and will determine whether GoPro's management will be able to right the ship and return the company to profitability. It will be launching both the Hero6 camera and Fusion – a 5.2k spherical camera soon. Also, this will be the first holiday season in which the Karma Drone will be fully available, after the recall disaster last season.In order to restore investor confidence, GoPro will need a series of strong quarters — and that means no operational glitches, sub-par guidance, production delays or messed-up product launches.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1917,GRMN,"The Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products Industry comprises an array of companies with diversified end-markets.The industry includes a number of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of different devices like air-conditioning systems, GPS navigation, home automation systems, healthcare devices, industry/factory automation, robotics and semiconductor applications.Moreover, apart from the United States, a number of companies in this industry are domiciled in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.However, the common thread between these is either they have manufacturing operations in China and South-East Asia or generate significant revenues from this region.Notably, the Chinese government’s strategy of providing subsidy has been a major driver for factory automation demand in China.Hence, the whole industry is tottering from the ongoing tariff dispute between the United States and China, particularly in markets like robotics, industrial automation and semiconductor applications.Moreover, being OEMs, the industry participants are exposed to volatility in prices of commodities like Copper. Commodity prices are likely to increase in the near term due to growing demand and concerns over tightening global supplies. Trade tension between the United States and China could also push the prices higher.Further, volatility in foreign exchange, particularly in currencies like Japanese yen and Thai baht negatively impact industry participants.The resurgence in Japanese yen is expected to continue in the second half due to growing U.S. protectionism and headwinds in the emerging markets. This doesn’t bode well for the Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products Industry.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that a tough operating environment has been hurting investor sentiments in the Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry’s growth prospects.The Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7.8%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 12.6% and 19.2%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceElectronics – Miscellaneous Products Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year, the Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry’s valuation looks cheap at the moment. One might get a good handle on the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 16.13, which is below the median level and close to the lowest level over the past year.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 16.82 and the median level is 18.34.Price/Earnings F12MMoreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a significant discount. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.20 and the median level of 20.53 for the same period are way above the Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products Industry’s respective ratios.Price/Earnings F12M Underperformance May Continue Due to Dim Earnings OutlookThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, increasing foreign exchange volatility and rising commodity prices are expected to hurt shareholder returns in the near term.However, what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance.Price and Consensus: – Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products Industry This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $1.73 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the EPS of the industry for 2018, but how this projection has evolved recently.As you can see here, the $1.73 EPS estimate for 2018 has remained steady from the end of April, but declined from $1.78 at the end of March. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry have been pessimistic about raising their estimates.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Blurs ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #231, which places it at the bottom 10% of the 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continually deteriorated over the past five weeks. Now, looking at the past revenue performances, the prospect of the industry also looks bleak.  Bottom LineA slow market growth rate and looming tensions over a trade war could weigh on the prospects of the Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry. Below are two stocks that carry a bearish Zacks Rank that we would recommend investors to stay away from for the time being.Fujitsu General Limited (FGELF  -  Free Report): Kawasaki, Japan-based Fujitsu carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1919,GRMN,"Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) specialized group of engineers known as MERIT —Major Emergency Response Incident Team — recently finished their annual training to ensure the protection of the company’s network assets and facilities in the event of natural disasters or hazardous materials incidents. Formed in 1992, Verizon’s MERIT team consists of more than 30 technically skilled communications employees. These members are certified and capable of entering into an area hit by hazardous materials spill and responsible for completing network repairs.In fact, the MERIT team is known to have a wide range of expertise in areas such as wireless and wireline telecommunications network equipment like fiber optic cables, routers, transmission equipment, customer premise equipment, wireless mobile assets, radio networks and critical infrastructure like Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Trained in emergency response management, this team of specialized engineers are also capable of operating at the highest operational protection level. The use of multiple tools enables them to detect over 30 chemicals, biological as well as radiological containments.Notably, the team’s training has been completed under the guidelines of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”). Verizon’s MERIT team is equipped with an onsite, climate-controlled mobile command center with a conference room, workspaces, external cameras, communications equipment, an on-board generator as well as a weather station.Our TakeVerizon expects its Wireless and Wireline businesses to perform impressively in 2018. Solid margin expansion owing to expected savings from tax reform and continued strong FiOS fiber-optic network and strategic services in the Wireline business is also anticipated in the same period. Further, the company is looking forward to capitalize on the countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things and telematics ecosystem across multiple industries. Verizon’s focus on online content delivery, mobile video and online advertising is likely to drive growth as well.In the past three months, shares of Verizon have lost 0.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.3%.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is systematically diversifying itself as a major player in the digital content and online advertising space.  Also, the company has been forging ahead to expand its fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE and upcoming 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections. Verizon too has an attractive fundamental outlook based on increasingly favorable growth prospects for its Wireless business and the possibility of improved performance from its Wireline operations.However, Verizon continues to struggle in the competitive and almost-saturated U.S. wireless market. The industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018, with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). Furthermore, in an effort to expand its customer base, the company is spending heavily on promotion and offering lucrative discounts, which might weigh on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report). All these three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The increase was mainly driven by higher sales of aftermarket products and positive contributions from OEM products.Revenues by GeographyWhile America generated 49% (down 18.9% sequentially but up 6.6% year over year) of the total revenues, EMEA and APAC contributed 35% (down 27.9% from the prior quarter but up 9.1% from the year-ago quarter) and 16% (down 1.7% sequentially but up 30% from the prior-year quarter), respectively.Operating ResultsGross margin was 60%, up 190 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.

1923,GRMN,"The Q1 earnings season has crossed the half-way mark, with results from 267 S&P 500 members having on board as of Apr 27.Per the latest Earnings Preview, approximately 76.8% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 73.8% surpassed top-line expectations.

1924,GRMN,"Fitbit, Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) has reportedly been downgraded by Morgan Stanley analyst Yuuji Anderson. The analyst downgraded Fitbit’s stock from equal-weight to underweight. Also, he lowered the target price by 20% to $4 on the stock, prompting a massive decline of 9.41% in its share priceThe company’s growth has been hampered by increasing competition in the fitness wearable category, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region.The impact of these headwinds has been significant on the stock.Notably, the company’s shares have lost a mammoth 85% since Jun 18, 2015, the day it started trading on the New York stock exchange at $30.40. Also, the stock has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While its industry has gained 18.4%, the stock has lost 19.1%.Why the Downgrade?This activity tracker and fitness device maker has introduced a number of new products in the recent past. Just last month, the company launched a modern fitness tracking device — Fitbit Versa, which is more akin to Apple Watch 3 and Samsung Gear Sport. It is a light metal smartwatch that provides a personalized dashboard to users with many other fitness and smartphone features.However, Yuuji Anderson believes that the new device isn’t much capable to offset the decline in Fitbit’s sales. He believes that though the company is making efforts to diversify its product portfolio, yet these products are unable to drive enough revenues for the company. Coming to the company’s sales figures, Fitbit sold only 15.3 million devices in 2017, a decrease of 32% from 22.3 million sold in 2016.The analyst believes that one of the main reasons for weak sales was the increasing competition, especially from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). The company faced a stiff competitive pressure from Apple’s Apple Watch that is a smartwatch combined with fitness tracking feature.Not only Apple, there are other big manufacturers too who are developing connected devices on Alphabet-owned Google's Android operating system.Yuuji Anderson wrote, ""We see more downside to the stock as revenues struggle to stabilize and cash burn resumes."" In addition, ""We think new smartwatches will be outweighed by declines in legacy products, while software opportunities in health coaching will take time to ramp.""ConclusionFitbit, which became a prominent name for its simple fitness wearables, has been hurt by massive competition in the market.It faces competition in both the high and low-end product range. On the high-end front, it competes with Apple Watch. Although Fitbit expected Ionic to help the company take on Apple, it is hardly an easy task to compete with one of the biggest companies in the world. Also, many big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Google's Android operating system.On the lower end, fitness-tracking devices from Jawbone, Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Xiaomi also pose tough competition.Even the launch of its flasgship Ionic and addition of innovative features have not helped it stay ahead of its competitors. However, we need to wait for a while and see if Fitbit’s new products can help it gain any meaningfully share from the rising opportunities in the health care business.Fitbit, Inc.

The other three in the top five list, having a mixed portfolio of fitness wearables, were Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Huawei with market share of 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively.Apple Watch Grabs the Lion’s SharePer the report, smartwatches generated 80% of wearable band revenues with 43% of shipments. Basic bands, representing 57% share of shipments, contributed only 20% to revenues.Notably, Apple represented 59% of sales in cellular-enabled smartwatch market, the firm adds. Garmin came second with 1 million units of smartwatches sold in the last quarter. Fitbit’s wearable band shipments consisted 24% of smartwatches.In terms of revenues, Apple is the clear winner, given the higher priced smartwatches it sells. However, competition in the space is expected to intensify if Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google comes up with a similar offering, which is currently lacking in the Android ecosystem, adds Canalys senior analyst, Jason Low.Per IDC’s latest estimates, the overall wearables market is expected to witness CAGR of 18.4% to reach 222.3 million in 2021 from 113.2 million shipments in 2017. The firm expects Apple Watch to lead the smart watch category, which is expected to witness CAGR of 22.7% from 2017-2021.More Room for GrowthApple Watch revenues showed double digit year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter. Unit sales of Watch also reached a new high in the fiscal second quarter. On the conference call, CEO Tim Cook added that the company’s wearables business is almost the size of a Fortune 300 company.Apple Watch’s popularity is also growing among teenagers, which is evident from the recently released Piper Jaffray’s Taking Stock with Teens survey.Per the survey, Apple Watch is the most preferred smartwatch among teens. Reportedly, out of the 20% respondents who own a smartwatch, 15% own the device, up from 12% in the fall 2017 survey. Samsung Gear stands second with merely 2% of the respondents owning the watch.Apple will reportedly launch Watch Series 4 in the third quarter of 2018, per KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The new generation of the Apple Watch is speculated to have a 15% larger display, trendy design, enhanced sensors for health monitoring beyond heart rate and longer battery life. Moreover, a drop in prices of older versions is also anticipated.Per KGI estimates, about 22-24 million units of Apple Watch will be sold in 2018, which indicates year-over-year growth of nearly 30%. Kuo projects Watch sales to reach 50 million units a year in the long term.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteIs Google the New Challenger?Apple Watch’s position might come under threat with a new offering from Google, which is rumored to launch a Pixel smartwatch at its October hardware event.Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has also recently confirmed that it is working on a new wearable chipset for Wear OS smartwatches. Per Pankaj Kedia, Qualcomm's senior director of Wearables, the new smartwatch chip “will significantly change the Wear OS ecosystem.”Moreover, the reason behind Google’s rebranding of Android Wear title to Wear OS in March 2018 was to make people understand that the wearables operating system is for everyone and not just Android users.Per the company, one out of three Wear OS users is an owner of an iPhone. The company is therefore trying to lure iPhone users by making the features work seamlessly on the device.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc.

1930,GRMN,"In a bid to bolster its presence in the smartwatch market Fitbit, Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) launched a modern fitness tracking device — Fitbit Versa. The product is already out for presale at $199.95 and will be available at stores from April 2018.Fitbit Versa — a light metal smartwatch — provides a personalized dashboard to users. It entitles users to have an easy access to their daily and weekly fitness data. The product boasts advanced fitness and smart phone features like 24/7 heart rate tracking, onscreen workouts and automatic sleep stages, quick replies on Android, on-device music and wallet-free payments on Fitbit Versa Special Edition.Fitbit already enjoys a first mover advantage in the world of wearable fitness trackers and we believe that its customer base will strengthen with the introduction of Versa.Product DiversificationWith the rising concerns regarding healthcare and fitness and the growing demand for smartwatches, Fitbit, instead of concentrating only on fitness wearables, has shifted focus on diversification of product portfolio.Reportedly, people are opting for pricier smartwatches that are equipped with fitness and health tracker instead of wearables which track only fitness.Previously the company used to manufacture smartwatches without fitness trackers. In a bid to address the evolving demand for fitness trackers in smartwatches, Fitbit launched Ionic last fall.Fitbit also unveiled Fitbit Ace, a wristband for kids aged eight or above — the company’s first fitness wearable for kids.The company is also rolling out a health tracking feature to help track menstrual cycles. The feature will be available on both Ionic and Versa.According to MarketsandMarkets report, the global wearable fitness technology market is expected to reach $12.44 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 13.7% between 2016 and 2017. Fitbit wants to capitalize on this and remain on a growth trajectory.Improving Competitive PositionWith Versa, the company’s competitive position is likely to strengthen against other players in the fitness wearable market like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Apple, Samsung Electronics, Xiaomi and Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report).Notably, in the last quarter, Fitbit’s growth was hampered due to the growing popularity of smartwatches in the fitness wearable category and influx of new wearables. The company faced a stiff competitive pressure from Apple’s Apple Watch which is a smartwatch combined with fitness tracking feature.Fitbit Versa is more akin to Apple Watch 3 and Samsung Gear Sport. Unlike Ionic, it possesses all the necessary applications and flaunts an attractive design.Thus, the new product is likely to boost the company’s sales and help it counter competition against Apple Watch 3, courtesy of its customer friendly price and needful features. The starting price of Apple Watch 3 is $329 while that of Fitbit Versa is $199.95. Fitbit, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Fitbit, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Fitbit, Inc.

1931,GRMN,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) topped the wearables market for the first time, and it seems to be a replay of what it did in smartphones.Apple Leads in Wearable DevicesThe device category that Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) pioneered is rapidly changing character as consumer tastes move from basic bands to smartwatches offering greater functionality and cellular connectivity. That’s the market that Apple has latched onto so well to become the leading player with fourth quarter unit shipments of 8 million, market share of 21% and representing growth of 57.5%, according to IDC.Despite its purchase of smartwatch maker Pebble and the subsequent launch of its Ionic smartwatch, Fitbit has been pushed to second place with 5.4 million units, which is 14.2% of the market and represents a 17.3% decline from last year. Xiaomi, Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Huawei follow with 13%, 6.5% and 4.3% market share, respectively. Huawei saw the strongest growth of 93.2% in the last quarter.   Other News--EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told CNBC that the European Commission will withdraw its complaint against Ireland for not recovering 13 billion euros ($16 billion) in unpaid taxes from Apple if it recovers the full amount. Considering the complex process, she has offered to overlook the considerable delay in recovery. Irish authorities have said that their calculations thus far are close to the commission's 13 billion euro figure.Apple could be taking baby steps in healthcare with its new subsidiary AC Wellness Network, LLC, first spotted by CNBC, which has the stated mission of delivering “the world’s best healthcare experiences for Apple employees.” On the face of it, Apple is adding to its corporate responsibilities by ensuring that its employees stay healthy. But it’s worth noting that the Cupertino-based company sells a smartwatch that’s expert at tracking healthcare metrics, as well as a very useful Health app. Last January, it introduced a new feature into the app that allows users to check their medical records on their iPhones. Tech peer Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) has  made more public moves into healthcare with its startups. Recently, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has done likewise through its collaboration with leading banks. So it's not too much of a stretch to think that Apple would also be in the fray.President Trump has proposed a 25% tariff on imported raw steel and 10% tariff on imported raw aluminum that is broadly expected to increase the price of many products that use these materials for packaging or otherwise. While a number of Apple products use Aluminum, it won’t be affected. As Gene Munster of Loup Ventures says, ""The only thing they make in the U.S. right now is the high-end Mac Pro,"" which probably accounts for about 1% of sales. So even if the cost of producing that 1% goes up 10%, there will hardly be any impact on Apple’s profits.Apple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). But you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1936,GRMN,"Investors who stuck through thick and thin for GoPro, Inc (GPRO  -  Free Report) have had their faith badly shaken lately. The stock has lost a whopping 46.5% in the past six months against the industry’s rally of 22.2%.Huge, multiple layoffs, heavy discounting, decaying fundamentals and a dismal track record of missing targets have hurt GoPro’s brand image in the market. Not surprisingly, we have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on GoPro.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.GoPro’s revenues have been highly volatile in the past three years, and have largely followed a downward trend, particularly in recent months. In fourth-quarter 2017 results, the top line took a severe hit (down 38.1% year over year) due to sluggish demand for GoPro’s Hero gadgets, and discounting of the Karma drones and Hero cameras during the holiday season.The company is anticipating revenues to contract further in the first half of 2018, as it clears inventory from sales channels.Bad KarmaThe company is shutting its drone business. Not a long while ago, GoPro had hoped Karma would help revive the company’s fortunes and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company. Karma witnessed a roller-coaster ride, punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs, thanks to problems like production delays and recall of 2,500 units due to a battery issue.Karma was, no doubt, facing mounting margin challenges in a tremendously competitive aerial market, dominated by the likes of DJI Technology and AeroVironment. A hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States further reduced Karma’s total addressable market and made its future untenable.The Bottom LineComing to the bottom line, GoPro has actually lost money in seven of the last 10 quarters. The company reported an adjusted net loss of 30 cents per share in the fourth quarter against earnings of 29 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents.Recently, GoPro has been aggressively cutting costs through a series of layoffs. In 2017, the company conducted two rounds of layoffs, slashing 7% and 15% of its workforce in January and November, respectively. Last month, the company announced another 20% layoff of its workforce. After the latest round, GoPro will end up with less than 1,000 employees.The company is targeting to limit operating expenses to less than $400 million in 2018 compared with $476 million incurred in 2017. This is likely to aid GoPro’s attempts to revive bottom line. However, the company already expects to book a net loss in 2018.What Went Wrong?According to the company’s founder and CEO Nick Woodman, the blame for GoPro’s third consecutive holiday season shortfall lay at the door of poor pricing decisions on its flagship cameras. This suspiciously sounds like the company is trying to downplay weak demand for its action cameras. At the very least, it shows that that for all its brand recognition, GoPro doesn’t really have any pricing power.In 2017, GoPro slashed prices for the Hero 5 Black and Hero 5 Session cameras. It also cut the price of its latest camera, HERO 6 Black, to $399 from $499. The constrained demand and price cuts are likely to affect the top line in the upcoming quarters.In light of the dismal developments, the analysts’ community has become bearish on the stock, with estimates plunging headlong in the past 60 days. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate nosedived from earnings of 44 cents per share to a loss of 37 cents over the past couple of months, highlighting acutely negative expectations from the company.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GoPro, Inc. QuoteTough Road Back to ProfitabilityDespite multiple challenges, GoPro still holds about 80% of the action camera market in the United States. In the fourth quarter, its unit sales grew 28% and soared 96% year over year in China and Japan, respectively. We are optimistic about the company’s subscription offerings.CEO Nicholas Woodman also expects that the cameras, to be introduced in the second half of 2018, will drive margin expansion. Thus, investors should watch margin trends as the year unfolds to see if the company can deliver on its commitment.Woodman is committed to revive the company’s business in 2018 and outlined strong restructuring measures to achieve the same. For now, it appears that investors don’t believe that GoPro’s initiatives can outweigh soft demand for its only real products, particularly as it exits a potential major revenue-generating business.An Easier Way?Amid severe operational issues, multiple layoffs and decaying fundamentals, GoPro has already lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report). Further, GAAP losses might result in additional cash burn, thus weakening the company's balance sheet even more.There is no easy answer to GoPro's troubles. If the company doesn’t turn its performance around soon, GoPro may have to sell itself. In fact, there were some reports recently that indicated that GoPro hired banker JP Morgan Chase to advise on a potential sale.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

1937,GRMN,"GoPro, Inc.’s (GPRO  -  Free Report) shares were still reeling from the shock of its dismal preliminary results, when the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings that hurt the stock even more.The company slipped back into the red as it reported an adjusted net loss of 30 cents per share for the fourth quarter, in stark contrast to earnings of 29 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents per share by a wide margin. The company has lost money in seven of the last 10 quarters.Not surprisingly, the company’s shares were trading 6.6% lower in pre-market trading at the time of writing.For the full year, the company lost $182.8 million on a GAAP basis, which was, nonetheless, better than the 2016 net-loss figure of $419 million.Inside the HeadlinesGoPro’s revenues for the all-important holiday quarter missed the mark as well, as sales plunged 38.1% year over year to $334.8 million, marking it as its worst holiday season since the company went public. The tally missed the company’s preliminary estimate of $340 million, which was already well short of its original estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged much higher at $384 million before the company released the preliminary figures.The top line took an $80-million hit due to discounting of the Karma drones and Hero cameras during the holiday season.For 2017, revenues came in at $1.18 billion, underlining a marginal decline compared to 2016.The weakness in revenues was broad-based across geographies. The company witnessed a 35.9% decline in the Americas to $175.7 million, while Europe plummeted 46.7% to $89.6 million. Also, sales in the Asia-Pacific region contracted 29.5% to $69.5 million.In addition, adjusted gross margin came in at 24.8%, down significantly from 39.5% in the year-ago period, and below the expected range of 25-27%. Non-GAAP operating loss came in at $37.4 million, considerably down from operating income of $31.6 million generated in the comparable quarter last year.Further, camera units shipped tanked 40.4% year over year to 1.361 million.Even so, there was a silver lining in the company’s bleak quarterly earnings release. GoPro noted that it holds more than 80% of the action-camera market in the United States, by unit volume. The camera manufacturer also saw its unit sales rise 28% and 96% year over year in China and Japan, respectively.For the reported quarter, R&D expenses continued the downward trend and slumped 43.4% year over year. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses dropped 42% year over year. Fourth-quarter operating expenses came in at $138.1 million, down 42.1% year over year.Restructuring MeasuresGoPro has been aggressively cutting costs in recent times through a series of layoffs. Last year, the company conducted two rounds of layoffs, cutting 7% and 15% of its workforce in January and November, respectively. GoPro also shuttered its entertainment and media business as part of the restructuring last year.Just last month, GoPro announced that it has decided to abandon its drone business, citing intense competition and a hostile regulatory environment. The company is also slashing 20% of its workforce after a sub-standard holiday quarter. Specifically, GoPro is letting go of around 250 of its staff and will reduce CEO Woodman’s salary to $1, in order to curtail operating expenses further.The current job cuts and restructuring will result in an estimated charge of $23-$33 million, most of which will be recognized in first-quarter 2018.LiquidityExiting the fourth quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $202.5 million, up from $192.1 million as on Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceIn light of such bleak results, the company refrained from providing any guidance for 2018.Our TakeNot a long while ago, GoPro had hoped Karma would help turn its fortunes around and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company. Karma has been a roller-coaster ride for the company, punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs, as problems like production delays to a recall of 2,500 units due to a battery issue plagued the drone from the beginning.

1938,GRMN,"Action camera maker GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) is facing trouble from all sides. The company is throwing in the towel on its drone business and slashing 20% of its workforce after a sub-standard holiday quarter. GoPro’s stock plunged as much as 32% yesterday (the biggest drop and lowest price level since it went public) after it released a profit warning ahead of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results.In fact, GoPro has reportedly hired banker JP Morgan Chase to explore a sale. The company’s shares have lost 27.3% over the past year, in stark contrast to the industry’s gain of 58.3%.Bleak Preliminary Q4 ResultsGoPro lowered its projected revenues for the critical holiday season to about $340 million, marking it as its worst holiday quarter since it went public. This marks a significant slump from an already disappointing previous sales projection of $470 million. Also, it represents a 37% year-over-year sales plunge in the key holiday quarter, and is miles behind the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $472 million. The company stated that its revenues took a hit of about $80 million due to discounting for its Karma drones, as well as the Hero line of cameras, during the holiday quarter.Late in 2017, GoPro slashed prices for its Karma drone, the Hero 5 Black and Hero 5 Session cameras. It also cut the price of its newest camera, HERO 6 Black, to $399 from $499. Soft demand and price reductions affected the top line, despite strong marketing support for key products.Bad KarmaNot a long while ago, GoPro had hoped Karma would help turn its fortunes around and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company. Karma has been a roller-coaster ride for the company, punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs, as problems like production delays to a recall of 2,500 units due to a battery issue plagued the drone from the start.

A hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States further reduced Karma’s total addressable market and made its future untenable.Restructuring MeasuresNevertheless, founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman is committed to turning the company’s business around in 2018, and outlined some further restructuring measures to achieve the same. The company is letting go of around 250 of its staff and will reduce Woodman’s salary to $1, in order to curtail operating expenses further.This would again mark the second double-digit percentage workforce reduction over the past year for the company. Last March, GoPro cut 270 jobs, which followed about 300 job cuts in 2016. After the latest round, GoPro will end up with less than 1,000 employees, down from 1,254.The current job cuts and restructuring will result in an estimated charge of $23-$33 million, most of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2018. GoPro will shed more light on the same and its 2018 outlook in its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings report, which it will release in early February.Amid its multiple operational issues, production delays and bungled-up product roll outs, GoPro has already lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report). Now with this major fourth-quarter revenue shortfall, the company’s full-year growth is in serious jeopardy.

1939,GRMN,"It seems that GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) has begun 2018 with a round of layoffs. Per a report by the tech news site — TechCrunch — GoPro has laid off nearly 200-300 workers, largely in its Karma drone business division.The report refers to an internal letter of the company which noted that the job cuts were necessary ""to better align our resources with business requirements."" Per the report, the employees were let go last Thursday, but will be kept on the company’s payroll until mid-February, which is when we expect GoPro to announce its next earnings report.The job cuts underscore GoPro's ongoing struggle to turn around its ailing business after multiple turbulent years. In its efforts to expand beyond the core video camera business, GoPro tried its hand at running a media and entertainment unit, and making drones. However, those efforts failed to yield success, forcing the company to shutter its media business and implement several rounds of layoffs. The company actually fired 370 employees in late 2016 and early 2017.Investors were particularly hopeful that the Karma drone would boost GoPro's sales, but the initiative encountered snags right from the beginning. The company was forced to pull the Karma off the market within 16 days of its release, after reports surfaced of the drones losing power mid-flight and falling from the sky. Karma was re-released in February 2017.While GoPro has not made the news about the job cuts or its impact on the company’s Karma drone business public yet, hacking such a workforce could be viewed as a possible retreat from something that was once seen as a great growth avenue.After several negative quarterly reports and multiple rounds of layoffs, GoPro seemed to be getting back on track, of late. In the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, released in November, GoPro turned in a profit of 15 cents per share on revenues of $329.8 million compared with a loss of 60 cents a share, on $240.6 million in sales reported in the prior-year period.Nevertheless, investors have been well guarded about putting GoPro back into their investment plans. The company’s shares have lost 17% over the past year, in stark contrast to the industry’s gain of 61.7%.Investors were clearly disappointed with GoPro’s soft growth projections for the holiday season, which was released along with its third-quarter results.GoPro has stated that it expects its holiday quarter sales to be subdued, which is curious, given a complete range of product offering and better supply-chain management. Compared to last year’s holiday quarter, this year GoPro ought to benefit from a full holiday season of Karma, two new cameras (GoPro 6 and Fusion 360) and a complete range of complementary accessories. Furthermore, GoPro seems to have solved its supply-chain issues which have plagued the company’s performance in the past.Despite all these supposed growth catalysts, GoPro estimates its fourth-quarter 2017 revenues to come in at about $470 million (+/- 10 million). This figure represents a 13% contraction from last year's tally and a massive 26% plunge from 2014’s fourth quarter. And GoPro suffered from major supply-chain issues last year that adversely affected the holiday season, which should also be taken into account in year-over-year comparisons.Projected full-year 2017 results don't look good either, and actually reflect negligible growth when normalized for supply-chain issues and messed-up product launches which supposedly hurt growth. Additionally, a free cash flow shortfall, and continued margin compression are other red flags that cast doubts over GoPro’s growth story.Evidently, weakness in the holiday season of 2017 would likely spill over to the first half of 2018 as well.Amid its multiple operational issues, production delays and bungled-up product roll outs, GoPro has lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report), which could be another nail in the coffin for this action-camera maker.GoPro currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1940,GRMN,"After launching IntelliSpace Portal 10, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) strengthened its advanced 3D modeling capabilities further by signing agreements with 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) — the two global leaders in the 3D printing industry.A couple of days back, Philips unveiled its IntelliSpace Portal 10 — the first advanced visualization platform — with an embedded 3D-modeling application, which will create and export 3D models intuitively into the clinical workflow.The company’s clients can enjoy a virtually seamless connection to 3D Systems and Stratasys solutions via IntelliSpace Portal 10. The solutions will help speed up 3D printing processes to create models, which will aid radiologists in understanding patient anatomy that is hard to visualize. Users will be able to create and save the model in IntelliSpace Portal 10, and easily transfer the data to the 3D vendors’ solutions, without needing to leave the clinical environment.By advancing the 3D-printing capabilities, Philips will help empower providers to improve care for intricate cases and raise diagnostic confidence.3D Systems’ solutions and 3D-modeling tools will help improve the clinical performance and optimize procedural outcomes through education and collaboration. On the other hand, Stratasys’ unique PolyJet-based full-color, multi-material 3D printing solutions will help provide customers with 3D printed anatomical structures on demand.The significance of 3D imaging and printing in healthcare continues to gain credence as users see the relevance of its integrated workflows in surgery planning, training and education. Philips’ agreements with 3D Systems and Stratasys will help accelerate medical progress in superior planning and patient outcomes.Philips has expanded its presence in the healthcare markets in recent quarters and projects this segment to be a long-term growth driver. However, the company’s near-term performance is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market globally. For instance, slowing government spending and events surrounding the ACA (Affordable Care Act) legislation have harmed prospects of the healthcare industry in the United States.The stock has returned 10.4% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 13.3%. Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bearish on this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company over the past few months, with estimates moving south. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved down from $1.58 to $1.37 over the past 60 days, thanks to two downward revisions compared with none upward.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader space is Garmin Ltd.

The collaboration will help pinpoint improvement opportunities, where a Philips Solution Advisor will facilitate Banner in the development of solutions to address areas for improvement.Per the agreement, PerformanceBridge Practice, a suite of operational performance improvement software and services, will be rolled out in all 28 of Banner’s radiology departments in a two-phased approach. The roll out will start with Banner’s 16 Arizona and academic sites, and will be expanded to its 12 radiology departments in five other states. Leveraging PerformanceBridge Practice will optimize Banner’s radiology department by enabling it to deliver on the Quadruple Aim of enhancing productivity, enhancing the patient and staff experience, as well as delivering better value-based care.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Further, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model is impressive.However, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. In light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the ACA (Affordable Care Act) legislation, the company expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth in the healthcare industry. Further, country-specific risks for China like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting growth. Not surprisingly, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has returned 10.4% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 13.3%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report), Control4 Corporation (CTRL  -  Free Report) and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report). While Garmin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Control4 Corporation and Advanced Energy Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1942,GRMN,"Tech stocks have been unpredictable at times recently, but the sector has rebounded from volatility strongly, and there is no question that tech has been the leader of the market’s strong multiyear run. However, this might mean that income investors—those focused on finding companies with solid dividends—might be feeling left out, as tech stocks aren’t really known for their payouts.Finding a strong dividend-yielding tech stock might feel like searching for a golden goose, but investors should not feel too intimidated. In fact, dividend-focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the Zacks Stock Screener, the perfect one-stop screening tool for investors of all kinds.By limiting our search to companies in our “Computer and Technology” sector with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better rankings, we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now. Throw in your preferred dividend yield and voila—the best tech stocks for dividend investors to target!Check out three of these stocks to buy now:1. Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report)Seagate is a global leader in hard drive manufacturing. It offers a range of disk drive products for the enterprise, client computing, and client non-computing market applications. Seagate is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The firm is currently generating a staggering $6.78 in cash per share on the back of 32% cash flow growth. Seagate takes advantage of its strong cash position by offering investors a dividend yield of 4.3%, making it one of the most attractive income options in the entire technology sector. 2. Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report)Garmin is a designer of GPS navigation and wearable technology equipment. The stock is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and presents a dividend yield of about 3.5%. Investors have to pay a slight premium for GRMN right now, but a valuation of 19.5x forward 12-month earnings and a PEG ratio of 2.3 are certainly not outrageous. Meanwhile, Garmin generates $3.42 in cash per share and sticks out from the rest of the technology group with its net margin of 18.6%, which dramatically outpaces its industry’s average of 1.7%. Garmin is also an efficient company, evidenced by its RoE of 15.7%. 3. Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report)Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. TXN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It should be a solid year of growth for the firm, with current estimates calling for earnings to expand by 28% in 2018. The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of 19.5% right now. Texas Instruments is really a cash cow, bringing in a total of $5.34 in cash per share. Management uses its solid financial position to reward shareholders with a dividend yield of roughly 2.2% currently. Want more market analysis from this author?

1943,GRMN,"Shares of GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has declined 16.3% in contrast to the industry’s surge of 50.5% in the same time frame. The company recently reported decent quarterly numbers but disappointed with its guidance issued for the fourth quarter. This is one reason why shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have declined post release of its results.If the company’s soft growth projections have let the market down on one hand, its satisfactory quarterly report offered some relief. The company reported earnings of 15 cents, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even level.Also, GoPro surprised investors with its sales figures as its quarterly revenues soared 37.1% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which marked the company’s second consecutive quarter of revenue growth.The company’s revenue growth was driven by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras and launch of its premium-priced HERO6 Black with global on-shelf availability. HERO5 cameras are enjoying impressive market traction, which is likely to reflect well in the company’s upcoming quarters. The HERO5 camera is proving to be particularly popular in China and Europe. Also, the company has been recently logging strong accessory revenues that should continue to drive the metric higher in the near term.GoPro has also significantly curbed operating expenses, limiting the possibility of making illogical decisions like selling the Karma drone at low margins and pushing inventory into the retail channel. Operating expenses in the third quarter were down a whopping 42.4% year over year, having significantly contributed to the earnings beat. In fact, the company expects operating expenses to fall below $500 million to boost profits and expand margins.GoPro has been aiming to transform itself from the ‘camera maker’ to ‘content maker,’ and has taken significant steps to diversify into higher-margin businesses including video editing and virtual reality.GoPro has definitely struggled of late with messed-up product launches, operational stumbles and several attempts to hit the right price points. Shares of the company have slumped over 56% in the last couple of years as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product roll outs. As a result, it lost ground to competitors like Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Nikon Corp. (NINOY  -  Free Report). This culminated in some significant layoffs, restructuring measures and the decision to shutter its nascent entertainment business.However, the current year has been kinder to GoPro with the company having cut down on losses and started to inch toward profitability. We remain optimistic about the company’s encouraging new product line-up, including the HERO 6, the new Fusion camera and a software update on the Karma Drone, which should drive growth and incremental margins for the company in times ahead.GoPro, Inc. Price and Consensus GoPro, Inc. Price and Consensus | GoPro, Inc. QuoteFurther, analysts have been witnessing positive estimate revisions of late, boosting a bullish sentiment around the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 being sharply revised upward from a loss of 3 cents to earnings of 5 cents over the past couple of months.Its robust product arsenal, positive analyst outlook, decreasing expenses and expanding margins bode well for the company. This uptrend should impact the share price as well. Investors, too, could benefit from the stock riding high on these positives.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1944,GRMN,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has decided to team up with Nuance Communications (NUAN  -  Free Report) to bring artificial intelligence-based (AI) image interpretation and reporting capabilities to radiologists. The partnership will leverage Philips’ Illumeo with adaptive intelligence, and Nuance’s PowerScribe 360, to reduce discrepancies, and improve radiology reporting, standardization as well as accuracy.Touted as one of the modern imaging and informatics technology, Illumeo is powered with adaptive intelligence. It supplements the work of a radiologist by integrating contextual awareness capabilities with advanced data analytics. On the other hand, Nuance PowerScribe 360, a real-time radiology reporting platform, facilitates rapid generation of high-quality actionable reports.  The integration of Philips Illumeo and Nuance PowerScribe 360 will enable radiologists to access a variety of tools at the point-of-care. These include tools for risk stratification, faster turnaround times as well as greater report accuracy and structure. The collaboration will enable radiologists to access AI-driven solutions and practical applications, including the integration of ACR guidelines, which would save time as well as effort along with improving report quality and patient outcomes.Healthcare Market Losing MomentumPhilips has broadened its presence in the healthcare markets in recent quarters and expects this segment to be a long-term growth driver. However, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. For instance, the company expects the United States to witness low single digit growth in the healthcare industry, in light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the ACA (Affordable Care Act) legislation. Also, factors like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering remain country-specific risks for China are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting the company’ growth.Moreover, as this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has a geographic presence in more than 80 countries, it is exposed to a number of regional and local regulatory rules in sensitive areas like healthcare. The company believes such stringent rules expose it to difficulties in obtaining clearances or approvals for new products, which in turn, may lead to unfavorable performance. Further, the industry in which Philips operates is highly dynamic, which indicates that failure to accelerate the company’s innovation-to-market processes may lead to materially adverse effects on its financial condition as well as operating results.  The stock has returned 6% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 9.3%. Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the past few months, with estimate revisions moving south. With two downward revisions compared with no upward revision in the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings has declined from $1.58 to $1.37.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Control4 Corporation (CTRL  -  Free Report). While Garmin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Control4 carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1945,GRMN,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere.

Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings.

1951,GRMN,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for GRMN’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Short Term Price Change for GarminA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity. This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now. It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.With a one week price change of 9.22% compared to an industry average of 0.00%, GRMN is certainly well-positioned in this regard. The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large.Longer Term Price Change for GarminWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of GRMN, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 19.07% to 2.38%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 16.7%. Clearly, GRMN is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.Garmin Ltd. Price  Garmin Ltd. Price | Garmin Ltd. QuoteGRMN Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with GRMN as of late.Over the past two months, three earnings estimates have gone higher same as  three lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that nine estimates have move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, GRMN was expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $2.83 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have GRMN as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep GRMN on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1952,GRMN,"GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) has been in the news again, thrust into the spotlight by the launch of the latest camera equipment from technology giant Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report). The move was preceded by similar releases from other established tech companies, thus pitting GoPro’s flagship cameras against tough competition, and forcing investors to question whether the Hero cameras can continue to hold their own in a rapidly expanding industry.The Evolution of CompetitionIn early days, GoPro had taken the action camera market by storm, but in recent times the company has grappled with stiff competition from lower-priced action camera alternatives.Earlier this week, Google rolled out a camera called Google clips, which has a 12-megapixel sensor and a 130-degree field-of-view lens, with 8GB of internal memory. The camera is priced at just $249, which is half the cost of GoPro's new Hero6 camera. Even though Clips is not as advanced and high-tech as the Hero line-up, it is cheaper and comes from a well-known company. GoPro's market could suffer further as Alphabet leverages its brand value and channels to aggressively market this product.Another such product is Sony Corporation’s (SNE  -  Free Report) latest action camera RX0 — which has features similar to GoPro’s line, and is waterproof and shockproof as well. The RX0 is due to be released in October.Then there is competition from Spectacles — Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) augmented reality and camera glasses — priced at $130. Olympus Tough TG –Tracker ($299), Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 ($380) and VIRB XE ($310), Sony’s FDR-X300 ($368), TomTom’s Bandit Action Cam ($170) and Nikon’s KeyMission 170 ($397) are a few of the other leading products which compete with the Hero cameras. GoPro’s latest Hero6 camera is priced at $499.Such lower-priced alternatives could corrode GoPro's market share and now, even its new video-editing software has a formidable competitor in Alphabet.Amid an onslaught of such tough competition and with reviewers increasingly recommending cheaper alternatives, we believe GoPro's market share faces a very real threat. Granted, the company has a huge fan following, but it’s increasingly plausible that its brand value might not be enough to fend off competition at this scale. Even its subscription and licensing revenue plans stand at risk, and might not be as successful as previously anticipated.GoPro’s KittyLate last month, GoPro unveiled the next version of its flagship action camera — the Hero6.The latest Hero6 Black camera enables 4K video recording, with 60 fps, and 1080p recording, with 240fps. It boasts enhanced video stabilization, a built-in zoom that can be controlled from the touch screen, and packs 5Ghz for faster video offloads. The Hero6 Black operates on GoPro’s new processor — GP1— and is quite a bit faster than its predecessor.The company also launched Fusion, its new 5.2k 360-degree spherical camera designed to capture both virtual reality, and standard video and picture. Earlier there was Omni, a video rig with six cameras, but the Fusion looks to be a more user-friendly, affordable version for the masses.Fusion’s USP is something the company calls “over-capture” — which enables users to capture an entire scene, and then frame just the shots they want afterward in the GoPro app.  Priced at $699, the camera’s shipping commences in November. No doubt, Fusion will face tough competition from Garmin, VIRB 360 camera of which seems impressive, but costs a steep $800. There are several other spherical cameras already in the market. With GoPro's brand recognition and deep foothold in the action sports world, the company has a real chance to take the lead in this market, provided it gets Fusion right.Getting it RightGoPro has struggled in recent years, with messed-up product launches, operational stumbles and hitting the right price points. GoPro's shares have slumped nearly 70% in the last couple of years, as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product roll outs, and lost ground to competitors like Sony, Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report), and Nikon Corporation (NINOY  -  Free Report). This culminated in some significant layoffs, restructuring measures and the decision to shutter its nascent entertainment business.This year has been kinder to GoPro, as the company cut its losses and started to journey toward profitability. In fact, the company has been increasingly aligning itself with the smartphone era. Consider the content creation war between Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Snap — it shows a secular trend toward individualized, social content creation. GoPro’s concept fits perfectly with this trend.However, the company’s products have failed to achieve mass traction in the absence of an effective sharing aspect — which is a key element. Interestingly, GoPro is now working on making the smartphone the central focus of creating stories, which could help the company break out of its shell.To keep a hold of its fragile market share, GoPro has to make sure that it gets its products and pricing exactly right. We remain optimistic on the company’s products, and hence have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on GoPro.
