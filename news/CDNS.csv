3,CDNS,"Thursday's saw-toothed session left stocks lower for a second time this week as Facebook (FB) reversed its early gains and investors looked toward Amazon.com's (AMZN) quarterly report after the close — and to the January payrolls report coming up Friday morning.Preliminary data show volume tracking well below Wednesday's levels on the stock market today.Early data showing a jump in January layoffs, lower-than-expected weekly unemployment claims and a slowdown in fourth-quarter worker productivity contributed to the session's wobbly start. Bonds were steady ahead of Friday's jobs report. Oil closed down a 0.5% with West Texas intermediate at $53.54 a barrel.Facebook backed out of modest early gains to end 2% lower following its fiscal first quarter earnings beat late Wednesday. The stock closed 1% above a cup-with-handle buy point of 129.37.Amazon managed a 1% gain in regular trade, but quickly dropped 4% after the close. The e-commerce giant's Q4 results were mixed, with a better-than-forecast 55% jump in earnings and a 22% revenue gain, which missed analyst expectations. The after-hours decline put shares back below an 821.75 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Extended session gains and losses often do not carry through to the next session's regular trade.Amgen (AMGN), AthenaHealth (ATHN), Deckers Outdoor (DECK) and Visa (V) were among  other names expected to report after the close.Infant formula maker Mead Johnson (MJN) spiked 22% after confirming it was in discussions with U.K.-based Reckitt Benckiser to acquire Mead's outstanding shares at $90 each, valuing the deal at around $16.7 billion. Mead's Enfamil is the second-largest infant formula brand in the world. Reckitt Benckiser shares ended 4% higher on the London Stock Exchange.Merck (MRK) was the Dow's big winner, up 3% after mixed fourth-quarter results were affected by the launch of a resource planning system and patent expirations on several key drugs. Merck closed 9% above a December low as it climbs the right side of a two-month base pattern.Among IBD 50 stocks, Cadence Systems (CDNS) screamed 12% higher.  The design automation software developer reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter results that narrowly topped analysts projections. Management's first-quarter earnings guidance was in line with consensus views; revenue came in above expectations. The breakout gain left the stock at a new high and 6% above a flat base buy point of 27.14.Prestige Brand Holdings (PBH), also an IBD 50 stock, belted out a 6% gain.  The maker of Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Efferdent and Beano stomped analyst fourth-quarter expectations and tightened up its full-year guidance. The low-volume move cleared a 53.90 buy point in an imperfect cup-with-handle base.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) dropped 8.5% in heavy trade despite reporting better-than-forecast fourth quarter results late Wednesday. Q1 and full-year guidance was in line with analysts' views, but BTIG downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.  Edwards had been in an uptrend since early December, working to recover from a deep, two-month sell off.RELATED:Online Brokers Fall As Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading FeesAmazon Mixed; Visa, Amgen Beat; Chipotle Profit Misses Late

4,CDNS,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is winning analyst praise heading into 2017 on views that its big investments in web infrastructure to deliver streaming video pay off, as well as its security-related acquisitions.Guggenheim Securities on Thursday initiated coverage of Akamai with a buy rating. Oppenheimer and William Blair recently named Akamai as among their top stock picks.Shares closed down 0.7% at 67.37 in the stock market today. Akamai stock is forming a cup base, with a buy point of 71.14 and has risen 28% in 2016, though the company is garnering less revenue from traditional customers such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network, or CDN, services, which increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices. Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been developing their own CDNs.IBD'S TAKE: Akamai's recent jump gave it spot on IBD Swing Trader on Dec. 14, but just at a half position. But it then got a full position on Tuesday. See Swing Trader for the very top prospects for shorter-term gains. AT&T launched a new streaming service branded DirecTV Now in late November. There may be upside for Akamai as AT&T's subscribers grow, analysts say.""AT&T's push into the over-the-top (OTT) video market could accelerate subscriber adoption of OTT services, which would benefit Akamai,"" said Michael Bowen, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report late Wednesday.Akamai's other video streaming customers are said to include Major League Baseball, Dish Network's (DISH) Sling and Ooyala.One wild card is how much video traffic Akamai might handle for new streaming services with live broadcast content coming from Hulu, Google's (GOOGL) YouTube and Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts say.Jonathan Schildkraut, an analyst at Guggenhiem, initiated coverage with a buy rating and price target of 75.""We expect investor focus to return to AKAM's core value proposition — that its unique, highly distributed, edge-based network architecture is superior not only for distributing content (including live OTT video), but also for the delivery of other services including web performance, security and longer-term cloud applications,"" Schildkraut said in his research report.Akamai on Wednesday made another security-related purchase, acquiring startup Cyberfend.Akamai's global network of computer servers store copies of website content for fast delivery to end users. Akamai has expanded into higher-margin services, such as cloud infrastructure and security, amid falling prices in its older CDN business.Longtime customers continue to shift web traffic to their own CDNs. Akamai's top six internet platform accounts (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix (NFLX)) accounted for 10% of its revenue in Q3, down from 17% in the year-earlier quarter, analysts say.RELATED: Akamai Security Business Shines, Offsets Apple, Facebook ShiftDish Network Taps Netflix As Streaming Battle Heats UpWill The Launch Of AT&T DirecTV Now Herald Net Neutrality's End?Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU

5,CDNS,"Small is beautiful. Small-cap stock mutual funds are ruling the investment world roost. And they've been driven by Mighty Mouses like Cognex (CGNX), which is up 11% over the past four weeks and 75% year to date.The machine vision company sports a strong 96 IBD Composite Rating. Its earnings per share jumped 2% and 97% the past two quarters, which followed three stanzas of declining EPS growth. Third-quarter revenue rose 38% to $147.9 million, marking the fourth quarter in a row in which revenue growth beat management's expectation.The Natick, Mass.-based, company's stock was the No. 2 holding of $3.3 billion Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX) as of Oct. 31. That fund is the top performing small-cap stock fund over the 10 years ended Nov. 16.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.The fund's 12.16% average annual gain the past 10 years was nearly double the large-cap S&P 500's 6.79%.These are good times for small caps. In the four weeks ended going into Friday, small-cap value mutual funds jumped 8.20% vs. just 3.31% for the average U.S. diversified stock fund. Small-cap core funds climbed 7.03% and small-cap growth rose 5.22%.Those gains topped returns by all other categories. Large-cap growth funds were down 0.09% in that span.Year-to-date, it left small-cap value funds up 20.12%, best among all categories in U.S. diversifieds, which as a group averaged an 8.34% gain. Small-cap core funds were up 15.55%, second best among all categories. And small-cap growth funds trailed, but were up a still-strong 9.13%.Small-cap stocks are thriving amid concerns that any trade war sparked by a Donald Trump presidential administration would hurt large-cap multinational companies the most. Meanwhile, U.S. economic growth at the moment is strong enough to prompt Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to say that a rate hike by the central bank could come ""relatively soon."" That economic growth has heartened small-cap investors.Small-cap funds have done well over the past 10 years as well. Small-cap funds with at least $100 million in assets averaged an annual gain of 6.91% over the decade vs. a 6.79% pace by the S&P 500.If you had invested $10,000 in a cross section of small-cap funds a decade ago, it would have grown into $20,939 by Nov. 16. That would be a bit more than the $20,256 result for the big-cap bogey.Some small-cap stocks are poised to perform well while also having already shown strength.Cantel Medical (CMN), another Brown Capital Management Small Company holding, is up 29% this year. The medical systems maker — which has a 95 Comp Rating — has been forming a cup base since late September. Trading around 80, shares have regained their 10-week line and are approaching their 81.63 pivot point.IBD'S TAKE: Cantel is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Medical-Systems-Equipment industry group due to key growth metrics. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 95. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which has a good 83 Comp Rating, is held by $6.8 billion Janus Triton (JANIX), the No. 2 small-cap fund over the past 10 years. The developer of electronic design automation software and related hardware is up 27% this year. Shares have regained their 10-week line and — trading around 26 — are within 1% of their pivot.Burlington Stores (BURL) is owned by $16.3 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), the No. 3 small-cap fund in the decade. Sporting an 84 Comp Rating and trading around 78, shares of the operator off-price retail outlets are up 81% this year. Earnings per share grew 3%, 39% and 105% the past three quarters. After a consolidation that began in mid-September, shares had regained their 10-week line as of midday trading on Friday and were climbing back toward an 87.23 pivot point.Integra Lifesciences (IART) is held by $5.1 billion Fidelity Small Cap Discovery (FSCRX), the No. 4 small-cap fund. Integra has an 85 Comp Rating. EPS grew 3%, 5% and 24% the past three quarters. Shares are up 21% this year. While working to regain their 10-week average, the medical-device maker's shares have climbed back to within 8% of their 88.86 pivot point.RELATED:Stock Outlook Shines For Managers Of Top Post-Brexit Mutual FundsThese Actively Managed Stock Mutual Funds Outperformed Their Benchmarks

Retail results and outlooks were mixed heading into Black Friday.The Nasdaq rose 1.6% for the week, briefly hitting an all-time intraday high Friday, as big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) recouped some losses. The Dow industrials, after the prior week's postelection spike to a record high, rose just a fraction. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, also close to record highs.

Some fiber-optic, chip and cybersecurity stocks broke out.Fed chief Janet Yellen said that a rate hike would be ""appropriate relatively soon."" She stressed the risks of delaying a move but also didn't sound like the central bank would follow up with a series of tightening steps. Yellen said she intends to serve out her term through January 2018, despite criticism from President-elect Trump during the campaign. Meanwhile, economic data were strong. Jobless claims tumbled to a 43-year low, housing starts spiked to a nine-year high and retail sales were robust heading into the key holiday shopping season. Consumer inflation hit a 2-year high, though it remains relatively low.RELATED:Fed's Yellen: Rate Hike 'Soon,' Will Serve Full TermTech unicorn Snap, owner of the popular short-duration photo and video site Snapchat, reportedly filed for a confidential IPO.

Both metrics topped analysts' view for $602.9 million and 74 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $621 million to $629 million in sales and 75-78 cents EPS ex items easily topped Wall Street's model for $608 million and 75 cents. At the midpoints of guidance, sales and EPS would be up 6% and 14%, respectively, vs. last year.Synopsys also upped its fiscal 2016 guidance to $2.41 billion to $2.43 billion in sales and $3 to $3.03 EPS ex items, up 9% and 8%, respectively. Earlier, Synopsys had guided to $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion in sales and $2.95 to $3 EPS minus items.Needham analyst Richard Valera credited Synopsys' consensus-topping fiscal Q3 to record bookings for the company's emulator and field-programmable gate array products. An emulator, like Synopsys' Zebu, imitates the behavior of a piece of hardware to determine functionality.Valera kept his buy rating on Synopsys stock and increased his price target to 60 from 54.

18,CDNS,"Think technology is an important sector this year? Without techs, the S&P 500 would be down for the year.The S&P 500 owes its entire year to the technology sector's 8.5% increase and a 25% weighting, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a report Wednesday. No wonder then, four technology ETFs are in this month's ETF Leaders screen, including First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology (QTEC).The fund tracks the technology companies in the Nasdaq 100 index. That brings it most of the largest techs, including titans such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC).Because the index is equal-weighted, midcaps such as Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Intuit (INTU) have about the same weighting as Apple and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The fund has 37 holdings, with more than 40% in semiconductors, 35% in software, 10% internet and the rest in hardware, telecom and services.With performance spread out among the components, the fund can better withstand a plunge like Baidu's (BIDU) 15% slide the past couple of weeks. In a cap-weighted portfolio, Baidu's loss would hurt more. But the index's structure also means big gains from major components will be muted.That approach hasn't necessarily hurt First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, and in some regards it has helped returns.As of April 30, the ETF had climbed more than 27% in the past 12 months. It rose about 22% in the past three years and 23% over five years. By comparison, SPDR Technology (XLK) was up 22%, 17% and 18% in the one-, three- and five-year periods. IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) was up about 23%, 17% and 19%. Both are also among IBD's ETF Leaders.First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, which is up about 9% this year, is rebalanced four times a year — in March, June, September and December. The Nasdaq 100 tech index is reconstituted once a year.The ETF's chart closely resembles the other technology funds in ETF Leaders: They are all forming double-bottom bases with handles. For First Trust Nasdaq 100, the buy point is 80.06. Some investors saw an entry May 10, when shares climbed past the 78.90 buy point from the middle peak in the pattern. Shares remain near that level.With its components culled from the Nasdaq 100, the ETF is mainly a large-cap fund. The median component's market capitalization is at $33.76 billion. These tech stocks tend to command a premium valuation, resulting in an average price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7 as of April 30, according to the First Trust website.The ETF, with $2.54 billion in assets, does face some sector risks. For example, chipmakers have cited slack demand from smartphone manufacturers.RELATED:The Year's Best Sector And How To Invest In ItActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHow Does The ETF Leaders Index Achieve Its Performance?

26,CDNS,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
27,CDNS,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

29,CDNS,"The Nasdaq took a stab Tuesday at its best gain in more than two months as the stock market approached the day's last hour of trade.Blue chips lagged with a 1.2% gain for the Dow industrials, while the S&P 500 stepped up 1.3%. The Nasdaq and the small cap Russell 2000 led with pops of 1.9% and 2%, respectively. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.Technicals are improving in the stock market. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day and 200-day lines Tuesday. The S&P 500 also reclaimed its 50-day line (after climbing above the 200-day line in March). Recently, the Nasdaq's 50-day line crossed back above its 200-day line, which is a positive development.The Dow industrials were up almost without exception Tuesday afternoon, with 29 of the 30 stocks rising, including Visa (V), which added 2.8%, its biggest percentage gain since early March. Visa's volume, though, was below average Tuesday. Boeing (BA) was the Dow's only loser, down 0.6% in strong volume.Is Visa's stock overdrawn with selling, or is the stock ready to charge higher?

Stocks breaking out included TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU), chip designer Ceva (CEVA), joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), telecom software developer BroadSoft (BSFT), water heater maker A.O. Smith (AOS) and financial data and analytics provider S&P Global (SPGI). S&P Global was formerly known as McGraw Hill Financial.New highs included designer of organic LED devices Universal Display (OLED), chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), software developer Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) and chip designer MaxLinear (MXL).Economic reports released Tuesday offered grist for the bears and bulls alike.For the bears: The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for May was weaker than expected. Wall Street had projected a reading of 8, but the figure came in at -1, a sign of contraction. In April, the reading was 14. Manufacturing weakness has been a concern in recent months. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP.For the bulls: New-home sales in April trounced expectations. The Street's consensus estimate was 523,000, but the economy posted 619,000 -- a stunning 18% beat and the highest level in more than eight years. The figure easily topped the entire range of estimates, which ran from a low of 510,000 to a high of 530,000.Homebuilder stocks rose in response, with gains mostly in the 3% to 5% range, but many of the stocks remain far off their highs. Toll Brothers (TOL) jumped more than 8% Tuesday on a strong quarterly report, but the stock was still about 30% below its August peak.Two homebuilder stocks have better-looking charts than most in their group.

Amazon stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, as the Wall Street Journal reported that Salesforce.com (CRM) was building a new service that uses AWS.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28, sending the stock up nearly 10% the following day.Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95, where 99 is highest.

Comcast moved into CDN services in late 2014, Bellini noted.One market trend could work in Comcast’s favor, said the Goldman Sachs analyst. “Multi-CDN deployments were a key theme of the conference,"" she wrote, ""with new startups making it easy to route traffic across multiple CDNs.”Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the No. 1 provider of CDN services.

34,CDNS,"Akamai Technologies' (AKAM) revenue from media and entertainment customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) is expected to fall in Q1, but analysts expect a boost from the Internet infrastructure company’s move into security services.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai, the biggest provider of content delivery network services, is set to report Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday. Akamai’s global CDN helps Apple, Facebook and other speed up video streaming, e-commerce transactions and business software downloads over the Internet. Apple, though, is among the big tech companies that has been developing its own CDN, while also using other CDN providers.Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital , is modelling a 3.5% year-over-year decline in sales for Akamai’s media and entertainment business but a 15% rise in cloud-security revenue.“We are looking for $207 million, or a 3.5%  (media segment) decline, as two of the company’s largest media customers (likely Apple, Facebook) transition off the Akamai platform. The concern over whether additional top media customers will migrate off Akamai remains the most material overhang on the stock,” Mahaney said in a research report. “Security is becoming an increasingly meaningful part of the financial story, accounting for 12% of revenue in 2015. We are modeling 45% year-over-year growth to $79.8 million.”Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT), and Limelight Networks (LLNW) as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare. Verizon Communications (VZ) (IBD), Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services,  IBM (IBM) and Comcast (CMCSA) also are emerging as new rivals in some parts of the CDN market.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Q1 EPS of $564 million, up 7% from the year-earlier period.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled 63 cents and $564 million.For Q2, Akamai forecasts revenue of $574 million at its midpoint of guidance and adjusted profit of 62 cents to 65 cents per share vs. consensus estimates of $578.4 million and 65 cents.“Revenue guidance is slightly under consensus, due to year-over-year decline in revenue from two major media delivery customers (Apple and Facebook) that are taking more of their volume in-house,” Michael Olson, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a research report. “Importantly, the impact from these customers is becoming less material as they go from 11% of revenue in 2015 to around 6% in 2016.”Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says Akamai’s guidance might be too conservative.“While we appreciate management’s decision to err on the side of being overly cautious after its surprising revelation regarding these two customers on its Q3 (2015) call, it highlights management’s lack of visibility with its own top customers,” he said in a report.Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Limelight Networks (LLNW), as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare. Verizon Communications (VZ), Amazon.com‘s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services,  IBM (IBM) and Comcast (CMCSA)  are also emerging as new rivals in some parts of the CDN market.""Akamai has been very clear that the first half of 2016 would be marked by slower growth in the media segment, but then it expects (Internet TV) video to begin to accelerate growth. Similar to other large, secular growth opportunities, it is often difficult to project the exact timing of the opportunity, but we believe growth from (Internet TV) will begin to manifest in second half 2016,"" said Michael Bowen, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.

48,CDNS,"Risk in swing trading is often misunderstood. The idea of frequent trading for smaller profits per trade might seem like there isn't enough gain to justify the potential pain. However, that overlooks the risk-reduction benefits offered by swing trades. What if you could take nearly the same gains with less pain?Taking small profits helps avoid corrections or even long periods where a stock doesn't make progress. Every day you own a stock adds risk of unforeseen events causing a loss of capital. Own a stock for fewer days and you've already reduced your risk. If you can capture the bulk of gains in those fewer days, even better.Take Square (SQ), a stock that has been on IBD's SwingTrader multiple times this year. When it was added July 11 at 25.07 (1), it quickly made a 5% gain. We took half profits the next trading day (2) and the stock inched up from there, riding its five-day moving average line.It was nearly at the 10% profit level when it sliced through the five- and 10-day moving averages intraday. In order to preserve profit, the remaining shares were removed (3) to keep the final result on the trade at 5%.While the stock did hit its 10% profit level a couple days later, it quickly retreated after that and formed a base over the next 34 trading days. Being out of the trade avoided a lot of potential pain without gain. We didn't sit on dead money. And while the correction was mild at just over 13%, the breach of the 50-day moving average in a weakening market could have easily shaken you out near the lows of the base.What's more, the money from selling Square on July 24 was available to put into Cadence Designs (CDNS) on July 25. Cadence Designs provided a 1.2% gain in just a couple days.After sitting out the base, Square was put on SwingTrader again on Sept. 7 at an entry price of 26.50 (4) right around the exit price seven weeks prior. It was played in a similar way by taking half profits at 5% a few days later (5), and finally removing the remaining shares to preserve the 5% profit as the stock fell below its five- and 10-day moving averages (6).From the original entry (1) to the last exit (6), more than two thirds of the gains were captured by holding the stock only one third of the days, and most of those with only half the position.A final point: The proverb ""familiarity breeds contempt"" doesn't usually apply in trading and certainly didn't with Square. Keeping past winners on your radar opens opportunities for future profits. Nothing sharpens your attention to a stock's personality like having money in the stock. And that familiarity can help in future trades — and breed profits.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Going Back To The Well Can Compound Stock ProfitsMoving Averages Help Lock In ProfitsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

50,CDNS,"Akamai Technologies’ (AKAM) push into cloud and security services could offset challenges in its media business related to Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), says RBC Capital, which initiated coverage with a sector perform, or neutral, rating.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney set a price target of 62. Akamai stock was down a fraction, near 55, in midday trading in the stock market today. Shares have edged up about 4% in 2016 but are down 24% in the past 12 months.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the No. 1 provider of content delivery network (CDN) services to media and entertainment companies. Akamai’s CDN technology speeds up e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.Akamai has expanded into higher-margin cloud infrastructure services and security, aiming to offset price cuts in the CDN business.“We believe the company can continue to see double-digit revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) growth driven primarily by cloud security and Web performance,” wrote Mahaney in a research report. “Excluding the company’s two largest media customers (presumably Apple and Facebook), we expect media delivery to remain in the very low double digits/very high single digits.“Given deceleration in revenue contribution from Akamai’s top two media customers (Apple and Facebook) in 2016, our estimates call for 9% year-over-year topline growth in 2016.  The company would need to grow 20% over the next four years to reach its $5 billion target. This would be impressive acceleration. Management has pointed to (Internet video) volumes, international revenue and strategic M&A as the key levers to support this growth inflection.""Amazon Web Services, part of the e-commerce leader, is not yet a serious rival to Akamai, while Microsoft has partnered with Akamai, noted Mahaney. Microsoft and Amazon are Akamai customers, though both also  operate commercial CDNs.“Microsoft and Akamai recently announced a partnership whereby (Microsoft’s) Azure CDN would leverage Akamai’s platform. Microsoft already uses Akamai for delivering software updates to the Xbox platform as well as updates to Office products, such as Windows 10 and Office 365,"" Mahaney wrote. ""Amazon’s use of Akamai is unknown, but since the company’s commercial CDN, AWS CloudFront, targets the low end of the market, we suspect Amazon leverages Akamai for large applications that have a high-performance standard and are delivered globally.”On Apple, Mahaney added: “We believe Akamai’s material OTT (over-the-top video) investments in 2015 targeted a potential Apple TV launch in Q4 2015 that never materialized. If Apple can make the economics work and moves forward with a new OTT offering, we expect Akamai will deliver a portion of this content.”IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group ranks No. 88 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.

It's getting resistance at its 50-day moving average after a nice rally in recent days. BMO Capital initiated coverage with an outperform rating and set a 700 price target.Ross Stores (ROST) was a top percentage gainer in the IBD 50, rising more than 2.5%, as Wall Street liked the look of its earnings report released Tuesday after the close.

53,CDNS,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) stock jumped Wednesday after the CDN services provider late Tuesday reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped analysts’  lowered expectations and gave in-line current-quarter profit  guidance.Shares of Cambridge-based Akamai were up 23% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 49. Akamai is the biggest provider of content-delivery network (CDN) services to media and entertainment companies.Akamai said it earned 72 cents per share in Q4, up 3% from the year-earlier period, with revenue rising 8% to $579.2 million. Analysts had modeled EPS of 62 cents and revenue of $569 million.The beat included a 6-cent tax benefit. Akamai bought back $100 million in its own stock, lowering share count and boosting EPS.Even with Wednesday’s gain, Akamai stock is down 7% in 2016. The stock had plunged 47% through Tuesday’s market close since Oct. 27, when the company  gave disappointing December-quarter guidance.For the current quarter, Akamai forecasts revenue of $562 million at the midpoint of its range, with adjusted EPS of 61 cents to 64 cents, vs. consensus estimates of $568 million and 63 cents.Full-year 2015 revenue rose 12% to $2.2 billion. On the company's earnings conference call, management backed off of its 2020 revenue goal of $5 billion, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a research note. Akamai’s technology speeds up video streaming to mobile devices, e-commerce transactions and business software downloads. Akamai has expanded into higher-margin cloud-infrastructure services and security, aiming to offset price cuts in the CDN business that average 15% to 20% a year.“The security segment, now at a $300 million (annual revenue) run rate, provided the (Q4) upside,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a report.Akamai’s stock has been pressured as some big customers shift to their own internal CDNs. Apple (AAPL), believed to be Akamai's biggest customer, and Facebook (FB) have been moving data traffic to their own CDNs.Akamai has renegotiated contracts and lowered prices in some cases, says Tim Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer.“The top two customers (likely Apple/Facebook) represented an average of 13% of revenue and likely closer to 11% in Q4, but that should decrease to 6% by mid-2016,” wrote Horan in a report. “The next two (likely Microsoft (MSFT)/Google) likely represent 5% and have likely re-priced. This should result in less revenue volatility in the second half of 2016, with upside if overall traffic volumes pick up.” Google is the main business of Alphabet (GOOGL). He says Akamai could gain from video streaming tied to the Olympics this summer, the presidential election and National Football League games.Aside from longtime rivals Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Limelight Networks (LLNW), Akamai is facing increased competition from Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), as well as Verizon Communications (VZ).

67,CDNS,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is revving its engine, improving its performance relative to its peers and the S&P 500. The $2.3 billion fund topped 64% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Wednesday. It improved to 84% outperformance year-to-date and 91% in the past three months.Up 15.52% this year vs. 12.45% for its peer group and 9.47% for the big-cap bogey, manager Paul Gordon pins the improvement on the market rotating back toward the types of growth stocks favored by him and fellow managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""Last year as people started to gain additional confidence in the economy, a lot more cyclical lower valuation companies started to rally,"" Gordon said. ""They had an extreme rally after the Trump election. But that's typically not an area we invest in. We look for long-term, not short-term, valuation opportunities. This year has been a reversal of that trend, back toward secular growth companies.""Holdings that have notched nice gains this year include graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 38% so far this year; chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which is up 23%; and design-automation-software maker Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which is up 40%.Nvidia is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Gains have left Nvidia, Monolithic and Cadence share prices extended, outside their buy ranges for investors looking for optimal entry points.Other holdings that have posted good gains are still within buy ranges.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), a maker of heart valves and other vascular disease products, is a stock in which Gordon's fund has raised its share count in recent disclosures. It has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD.""This medical device company has a product that is a better way of doing traditional aortic valve replacement surgery,"" Gordon said. ""It tends to provide better medical results and safety. We think the runway is long for them to continue to increase (the number of) procedures to be done this way going forward.""IBD'S TAKE: In addition to Edwards Lifesciences' sterling 99 Composite Rating, it has four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth. See how its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.LogMeIn (LOGM) is another stock in which the fund has been building its stake. Earnings per share for the maker of business and videoconferencing software rose 22%, 22% and 143% the past three quarters. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect second-quarter profit to rise a very good 90% to 93 cents a share.""They have a nice market share within a niche market,"" Gordon said. ""They recently purchased an asset called (GetGo, whose products include GoToMeeting and related offerings) from Citrix Systems (CTXS). I think they have an opportunity to improve that business. For Citrix, it was not part of their core business, so it did not get (maximum) attention within a bigger company. Now it is very complementary to what LogMeIn knows and does.""Software maker SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is up 36% so far this year. Gordon said, ""They provide back-office software for financial companies. They're taking share from in-house and other third parties. This company sold off last year at the height of (investors') fear about a decline in hedge-fund growth. But this stock has recovered.""Five Below (FIVE) offers trendy, high-quality brands that sell for $5 or less in its 500-plus stores. It plans to open 100 more in 2017-2018.""What we like about Five Below is that it is a bit of a combination of Dollar Store and off-price store, so it sells low-priced items that change seasonally and are attractive to customers because they (require) a bit of a treasure hunt. They're a fun place to shop for fairly cheap, consumable items. The total store opportunity for the company is fairly large. The returns on new stores are very high. So they are able to get great footage growth at high rates within their cash flow, and we think they should continue.""Shares are up 30% this year. IBD readers would recognize that on Wednesday afternoon they were trading a shade below their 52.80 entry point.Gordon summarizes the fund's strategy as ""focusing on secular growth companies in which we have high confidence of long duration of above-average earnings growth.""If the market is performing a Trump Dump — rotating away from lower valued cyclical stocks that could benefit from Trump policies — that should provide the fund with only a small additional tailwind. Gordon said, ""It might provide some opportunities, but only on the margin to find additional names to add to the portfolio.""Over the past 10 years the fund's average annual return of 6.13% topped only 31% of its direct rivals. Managers Fischman, Gordon and Sabel joined the fund in 2008, 2011 and 2014 respectively.RELATED:A Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio: Trump-Era Stock Plays, Plus Stocks To Like No Matter Who's PresidentMFS Aligns Management Teams On Growth Fund And Mid Cap Growth

""Our rating simply reflects the fact that in the intermediate term, with a tough slate comp and FX headwinds, we think fiscal 2018 will be a slower-than-average growth year, without identifiable catalysts to generate investor excitement.""EA shares were up 0.2% to 92.99.

71,CDNS,"Mentor Graphics (MENT) stock crashed after hours Thursday from near a 14-year high as the maker of software used to design chips guided to Q4 sales and earnings vastly below analysts' expectations, and shares tumbled to a 13-month low.In early trading Friday, Mentor Graphics stock was down more than 32% and trading just below 19 for the first time since October 2014. Before the firm's Q3 earnings release, shares were up 27% for the year. As of Friday morning, they're down 13%.Key rivals Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Synopsys (SNPS) felt the weight of Mentor's burden Friday. Early in the stock market today, Cadence was down nearly 6%. Synopsys stock closely trailed, falling more than 5%. Synopsys is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings after the close Dec. 2.For Q3, Mentor Graphics reported $290.5 million in sales and 28 cents earnings per share ex items, down 1% and 18%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures missed the consensus for $291.8 million and 29 cents.Mentor also guided to current-quarter sales of $336 million and non-GAAP EPS of 47 cents, down 23% and 57%, respectively, vs. the year-ago quarter. Analysts were expecting $439.3 million and 97 cents.Chip M&A Could 'Pose Challenges'On Friday, Mentor stock suffered at least two price target cuts and two downgrades. Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg blamed rival Cadence's release of a new emulation tool ""that led customers to delay decisions around emulation"" for Mentor's $105 million cut to Q4 sales guidance.Garg downgraded Mentor stock to sector weight, noting, ""We expect semiconductor industry consolidation to continue, which could pose challenges to Mentor's growth.""Mentor had been on a strong growth streak previous to Q3. Since March 2011, sales have declined only twice and EPS just three times.For the year, Mentor cut its sales guidance to $1.18 billion from earlier guidance for $1.88 billion. The company now expects $1.40 non-GAAP EPS vs. its three-months-ago view for $1.90.Preliminarily, the company guided to low single-digit percentage growth for 2017 sales.This reflects continued consolidation within the chip sector, Garg wrote in a research report. Mentor CEO Walden Rhines estimated $100 billion thus far in 2015 deals, during Thursday's conference call with analysts.""We are concerned that consolidation in the semiconductor industry could continue for some time, which means more impact on Mentor in the coming years,"" Garg wrote. ""This also raises concerns about Synopsys and Cadence.""D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely downgraded Mentor Graphics stock to neutral from buy. He also cut his price target on the stock to 24 from 32.Emulation is typically ""lumpy"" and therefore subject to quarter-over-quarter volatility, Diffely wrote in a report.""We are more concerned about the shortfall in the core EDA market and the prospect of this weakness extending through next year,"" he wrote.Key customers such as Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (BRCM) — soon to be acquired by Avago (AVGO) — could seek better EDA pricing elsewhere with combined merger heft, he wrote. Or a renewed contract could be for a shorter term amid M&A hype.""Bottom line, the outlook for low single-digit growth next year is well below our expectations projected from these scenarios,"" he wrote. Mentor guided 2016 sales at 2014 levels, and the company is ""underperforming its peer group.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

145,CDNS,"Investors clearly disagreed Thursday with Synopsys (SNPS) CFO Trac Pham, who late Wednesday likened the company's three-penny trim of 2015 earnings guidance to ""a deferred haircut.""Synopsys closed down 7% in the stock market today at 48.60, though shares regained a little after hours.During the company's Q3 earnings conference call, Pham attributed the EPS haircut to four hefty acquisitions in Q3 expected to remain dilutive in 2016.Synopsys works in electronic design automation and semiconductor intellectual property. In Q2, the company guided to $2.76-$2.81 non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015. On Wednesday, Pham pulled back from that, guiding to between $2.76 and $2.78 EPS ex items for the year.""We did tweak the earnings guidance at the midpoint by about penny or 2 cents to reflect a dilution,"" he said.But, CEO Aart de Geus later added, one of those dilutive acquisitions is expected to be accretive in 2016. Synopsys acquired Coverity, a software quality- and security-checking firm, in February 2014.""From a philosophy point of view, the way to think about it is that as we add acquisitions, we aim to within I would say 12 to 18 months make them accretive,"" he said.Overall, however, the acquisitions balance — which includes chip verification company Atrenta in June — will be dilutive in 2016, de Geus said.'A Good Beat'Analysts were less critical of Synopsys as it emerged from Q3 with 63 cents EPS ex items on $555.8 million in revenue. EPS fell 2 cents vs. Q3 2014, whereas revenue jumped 6.5%.Synopsys beat the consensus forecast of seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters who expected 59 cents per share for earnings on $555.4 million in revenue.For Q4, Synopsys guided to between $570 million and $585 million in revenue and between 65 cents and 67 cents non-GAAP EPS, which would be up 3% at the midpoint vs. Q4 2014.Pham also hoisted Synopsys' 2015 revenue guidance to between $2.23 billion and $2.24 billion, an increase from the $2.21 billion to $2.24 billion forecast in Q2.Historically, Synopsys has lagged Mentor Graphics (MENT) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) in the emulator business, Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg wrote in a research report.""But, it seems Synopsys' strategy of focusing on integrating its simulation, verification and emulation tool in the 'verification continuum' is paying off,"" she said.The verification continuum is Synopsys' name for its software-verification platform, on which customers use the company's products in conjunction with one another.Garg called the company's Q3 ""a good beat"" and estimated Synopsys' IP revenue could grow into the double digits with the burgeoning use of IP in chip design.Garg suggested Synopsys may have also scooped an emulation contract — ""Intel, in our view"" — from Mentor.She maintained her 60 price target on Synopsys stock and reiterated an overweight rating.Thomas Diffely, of DA Davidson, hiked his price target on Synopsys stock to 60 from 56 and rated it a buy.Despite the temporary dilution, Diffely sees Synopsys ultimately garnering profit stemming from the $125 million it spent in Q3 acquisitions.""SNPS is building a meaningful presence in these growth markets that should ultimately drive earnings,"" he wrote in a research report.Connect with Allison Gatlin: Twitter | Facebook.

160,CDNS,"Akamai Technologies has a big play in Internet video, says Deutsche Bank, which joins other bullish Wall Street analysts on the CDN provider's long-term market opportunity with Apple (AAPL) and others.Website Streaming Media, however, says sell-side views that Akamai has a big payday coming from Apple's launch of a Web TV service are misguided.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai (AKAM) is the biggest provider of CDN (content delivery network) services to media and entertainment companies. While Apple's launch of an over-the-top (OTT) video service may have been delayed until 2016, Akamai stands to benefit from a wide array of Web video launches, says Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath in a research report.""We see a $500 million a year opportunity for Akamai in TV OTT, as the long tail (NBC, CBS (CBS), HBO, ESPN, Apple, Dish-Sling (DISH), Comcast (CMCSA), Hulu) generate the next 10% or more of Internet video traffic,"" said Bhagavath.Bhagavath joins other bullish Wall Street analysts in saying Akamai's network investments and higher capital spending will pay off.Pacific Crest Securities says Apple will still need Akamai if it expands its own CDN capabilities. William Blair & Co. also says Akamai's higher capital spending will generate more revenue.Dan Rayburn, a blogger at Streaming Media and analyst at Frost & Sullivan, says otherwise.""Apple's OTT service will not be a big revenue driver for Akamai or any other CDN right out of the gate,"" said Rayburn in a blog post. ""If Apple signs up tens of millions of subscribers and gives a large percentage of the delivery to third-party CDNs like Akamai, then the numbers could start to add up. But Apple would be lucky to get a few million subs, within a few quarters, with what is expected to be a pared-down selection of content available.""Apple is still in talks with programmers over rights to live broadcasts and a limited number of cable TV channels.Deutsche Bank's Bhagavath expects many companies to jump into Internet video. He raised his price target on Akamai to 80 from 77.As more U.S. households cut the cord and use only broadband to get TV, ""we note a base of 11 million broadband homes in the U.S., growing 10% year over year (SNL Kagan data), is a significant and growing viewer base for the exabytes of Internet Video traffic that Akamai could monetize over the next few years,"" he said.Akamai gets a strong Composite Rating of 90 out of a possible 99 from IBD. Akamai stock has been consolidating around its key 10-week line, though after several days of market volatility it has been trading just under that point in the stock market today.RELATED:Akamai Web TV Payoff Seen 'Late 2015 And Into 2016'

In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck’s brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company’s top line.Nevertheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report), which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (ULTI  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

225,CDNS,"The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment.Software has become the focal point of technological innovation. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry’s growth prospects.The Zacks Computer Software Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceWhile the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever, the Computer Software industry’s valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Moreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Price and Consensus: Zacks Computer Software IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Long-Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate Computer Software’s long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.  Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report): The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has increased 1.9% over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: ANSS Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report): The consensus EPS estimate for this Fort Lauderdale-based virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions provider has moved 8.2% higher for the current year, over the last 60 days. The stock has rallied 32.4% over the past year.Price and Consensus: CTXS Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report): The stock of this San Jose-based electronic product designing solutions provider has jumped 31.8% over the past year. The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has been revised 3.8% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: CDNS Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report): The stock of this San Jose, CA-based software solutions provider has gained 77.9% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 3.6% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: ADBE Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geopolitics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks Research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

226,CDNS,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $210.85 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging fourth-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.5% since it reported fiscal third-quarter results on May 22. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company’s results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company’s product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.Factors Driving Intuit’s Robust Quarterly PerformancesThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company’s Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The company, during the last earnings conference call, stated that its TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in the first season and is likely to be accretive to the company’s Consumer business, moving ahead.The recently-launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user’s financial health also witnessed healthy adoption, which is yet another catalyst for expansion of the company’s business beyond tax.Furthermore, its TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion Intuit’s bottom-line results.A Buy Rated StockIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and flaunts a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.Some Other Stocks Worth ConsideringSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

Both the top and bottom lines fared better than the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guided ranges. Notably, the company has adopted the new revenue rules of ASC 606 and accordingly incorporated the same while reporting first-quarter results.Cadence reported non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents per share for the first quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Revenues increased 8.5% year over year to $517.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $506 million.Robust adoption of the company’s digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an ever expanding customer base fueled overall year-over-year growth.

Robust adoption of company’s digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an expanding customer base remains a positive. Significant demand from aerospace and defense sectors is a key catalyst. Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company, going forward. Reduction in long-term debt and improvement in cash balance are tailwinds.To ConcludeThe company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 2.8%.We expect the trend to continue and drive the overall financial performance of this stock.Some other top-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Long-term earnings estimates for NVIDIA, Western Digital and Seagate are currently pegged at 10.25%, 19% and 18.9%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

228,CDNS,"Liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that investors often ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications.

229,CDNS,"Last week, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced that it was buying GitHub, checking the feasibility of an underwater data center and exciting new stuff at the electronic entertainment expo. Here are the details-The Huge GitHub PurchaseMicrosoft’s $7.5 billion GitHub purchase is a very big deal because open source prospects have increased hugely in the last few years. And GitHub is the platform hosting the largest open source community of 20 million members with its storage, collaboration and communication tools.The platform functions through three processes: forking, which allows any user to copy a repository to his own account to develop the idea (GitHub has 57 million repositories); pull request, which is a request to the original owner to accept the change if desired; and merge, which allows the owner to accept the change by the click of a button after also checking the member’s credentials and past work done on the platform.GitHub charges through a subscription model that includes unlimited public repositories for all plans. Private repositories cost $7, $12, $22 and $50 a month for Micro, Small, Medium and Large plans including 5, 10, 20 and 50 private repositories, respectively (for individuals). Teams are charged $25, $50, $100 and $200 for Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans that include 10, 20, 100 and 200 repositories, respectively. Users can add additional storage and bandwidth, each at $5 for a 50 GB pack.Businesses are charged $21 per user per month. GitHub Enterprise (hosted on a company’s own servers, AWS, Azure, or GCP) starts at $2,100 per 10-user seat pack per year, which includes maintenance, upgrades and technical support at no extra cost. And still, GitHub has yet to make a profit, which is why it needs a bigger partner that can provide it with funds and additional resources, while also helping it to market the business and enterprise segments.That’s where Microsoft comes in with its deep pockets, huge sales team and enterprise focus. CEO Satya Nadella was very clear about the rationale for the deal. He said that software was increasingly getting into non technological sectors at an unprecedented rate such that these sectors were hiring 25% more developers than the technology sector.Microsoft wanted to capitalize on this trend. It isn’t hard to understand that these people would need a platform on which to communicate and collaborate. Microsoft could merge some of its tools into the GitHub platform and market them jointly to its huge enterprise customer base.There are some trust issues as some older developers remember Microsoft’s past, when it was the bitterest critic of the open source platform and used its might to ensure that its own paid platform continued to dominate. But as the new GitHub CEO Nat Friedman has said, the company is determined to regain that trust. As developers understand that the success of the acquisition depends on its remaining open source and as independent as it is today, these problems will be automatically resolved.The Second Underwater Data CenterMicrosoft is sinking a data center called Northern Isles into the North Sea off the Scottish coastline in an attempt to lower cooling costs in the second phase of trials as part of what it calls Project Natick. Natick is a research project studying the efficiency of data centers. In the first phase, a smaller data center was put on the sea floor off the California coast for 105 days with the goal of seeing whether it was possible to operate such a submerged data center.In this phase, Microsoft is going to study the logistics and cost of operating such a data center, as well as its impact on the environment, including the effect of heating up the waters and disturbing surrounding wildlife. A data center uses just 2% of the energy it receives with the rest dissipated as heat that because of its nature, can’t be transported or put to other use.The experimental data center is medium sized at 12.2 meters in length and 3.18 meters in diameter, containing 12 racks housing 864 servers. It has a capacity of 27.6 petabytes, which Microsoft says is as much storage space as five million movies and packing as much power as thousands of high-end PCs. Some of the servers will be kept as standby because repairs won’t be possible during the 12 months it is intended to remain underwater.  Microsoft says that once submerged, the data centers can be moved with relative ease to the places where it’s most required and since most people live by the coast line, this will mean faster games and lower latency for all operations, including self-driving cars.Microsoft at E3E3 for Microsoft was a statement that the company remains as determined as ever to make good on the ground it lost with the last game console.First, it announced 52 new video games including 18 exclusives, which is a big deal given that exclusives are what differentiates a gaming console. This year, the exclusives included Halo Infinite, Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Forza Horizon 4 and Battletoads.Second, it announced that some games that had been exclusive to Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) console, such as the Disney-themed adventure Kingdom Hearts 3, Activision’s (ATVI) Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Capcom’s Devil May Cry 5 are now also available on Xbox.Third, indicating its focus on exclusives, Microsoft announced the acquisition of a number of gaming studios, including Seattle-based Undead Labs, Montreal-based Compulsion Game, and UK-based Playground Games and the BAFTA-winning Ninja Theory.

230,CDNS,"If you are still holding on to shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Symantec has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 24.4% of its value in the year-to-date period, substantially underperforming the 17% rally of its industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at factors behind this plunge.Investigation Woes Pulling Share Price DownThe plunge particularly came after the company, during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, reported that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into the concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, Symantec stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, has resulted in a plunge of more than 27% in Symantec’s shares since May 10 to till day.Later, on May 14, this cyber-security provider held another press meet and stated that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.We believe this information is inadequate to gain investors’ confidence. The ongoing investigation may throw light on some serious issues which might severely cost the company in the near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Dismal Outlook Dims Near-Term ProspectsSymantec’s weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 makes investors cautious about its near-term performance. Also, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2019 in the range of 30-32%, which reflects a substantial decline from the fiscal 2018 level of 34.7%. The reduction in margins is mainly due to continued shift of business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity.Downward Estimate RevisionFollowing the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and investigation revelation, the stock has witnessed sharp downward estimate revision. For fiscal 2019, we have seen 14 estimates moving south in the past 60 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward from $1.82 to $1.57.Additionally, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents per share from 41 cents per share, in the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the computer-software industry space are Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report), Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected earnings growth rate for Cadence Design Systems, Aspen Technology and Citrix Systems are 12%, 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

231,CDNS,"Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with a favorable liquidity position for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.Liquid stocks have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

236,CDNS,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) recovered part of last Friday’s losses, yesterday, after the company announced a conference call to discuss the ongoing investigation, post market close, which investors believe, will throw light on its internal probe.It should be noted that the company, during the fourth-quarter 2018 earnings conference call, had announced that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, it stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, resulted in a plunge of more than 33% in Symantec’s shares, last Friday, eroding almost $6 billion of the company’s market cap in a single day.However, the stock recovered 9.6% yesterday, following the company’s conference-call announcement. Though Symantec did not reveal much about the internal probe, its announcement reinstated investors’ confidence, reflected by the stock’s 2% improvement, at the after-hour trading.Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry in the year-to-date period. The industry, to which it belongs to, has gained 12.9%, while Symantec has lost 23.7%. The cyber-security provider noted that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.Nevertheless, investors heaved a sigh of relief when Symantec mentioned that it “does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements” at this time.However, we believe its too early to predict what picture the investigation would paint, going forward. This is expected to throw light on serious issues which might severely cost the company in near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Symantec currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PTC Inc.

238,CDNS,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced that a host of its solutions has been selected by Arbe Robotics for its patented imaging radar meant for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.Arbe Robotics’ imaging radar has a high resolution and offers a “wide 100-degree field of view” even in difficult conditions such as heavy rains, fog or extreme darkness. The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys’ “DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).”The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys’ IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS. Additionally, “safety documentation, including failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) reports” are anticipated to quicken the pace of the chip’s ISO 26262 Certification.Notably, in May, Synopsys unveiled the industry’s first ASIL D Ready embedded vision processor IP for applications in ADAS and autonomous vehicles. It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover’s advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteSafety First for ADASDiscussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies’ autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), the manufacturer of hardware for Uber’s technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys’ IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys’ part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run. These will also aid the company in competing against peers like Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSynopsys currently has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).A better-ranked technology stock is Citrix Systems, Inc.

240,CDNS,"In the high-tech space, hardware manufacturers have enjoyed the lion’s share of the news and commentary recently.  Semiconductor stocks in particular have had a wild ride in 2018, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rising 19% between February 8th and March 12th, only to retrace the rally as it sank 14% by April 25th.Concerns about a global demand slowdown, reduced cryptocurrency mining and tightening margins due to commoditization - especially in DRAM and flash memory - spooked investors.    A number of positive earnings reports alleviated the fears and semiconductor stocks have staged a partial comeback, led by Micron Technologies (MU  -  Free Report), which is up 28% in the past month.With action like that, it’s no wonder hardware has dominated the financial news cycle.Quietly, several major producers of software have posted strong earnings and guidance and had estimates revised upward.  Investors are taking notice as shares of these three strong performers are starting to rise.Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) provides business virtualization solutions to business through three major product lines, XenApp, NetScaler and Citrix Workspace.  Partners with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet  and twelve other large technology companies, Citrix allows users to transform the traditional workspace by providing secure access to applications, desktops and data on any device.In Q1, Citrix delivered earnings of $1.29/share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05/share, its fourth consecutive earning surprise in a row.  The company also raised full year earnings guidance  to a range of $5.20 – $5.30/share.  12 analyst upward revisions followed and the 2018 consensus estimate now stands at $5.27/share.  Citrix is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report) provides design technologies to the producers of high tech equipment, including the semiconductor industry.  While announcing strong Q1 results in which Cadence beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate of $0.38/share by $0.02, CFO John Wall stated “We are pleased with results of all of our key operating metrics including revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow.  On the strength of our first quarter business and continuing momentum, we are raising our outlook for the year.”The company now expects 2018 Revenue in the range of $2.05B - $2.1B and Earnings of $1.57 - $1.65/share.  The shares, which formerly closely tracked the Consumer Software Services market as a whole, are beginning to break out, up 5.6% this year versus an industry average of -3.1%.  Cadence is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Famously founded in the San Francisco apartment of ex-Oracle executive Marc Benioff in 1999, Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) is now the worlds leading provider of “Software as a Service”, allowing businesses of all sizes to build their own applications either on their own architecture or in Salesforce’s cloud environment.Salesforce provides its CRM (customer resource management) software services to over 100,000 customers worldwide.  Salesforce shares are up 24% in 2018.After modest earnings beats in the past 14 quarters, Salesforce is expected to report revenues of $2.94B and earnings of $0.46/share when it releases fiscal Q4 results on May 29th.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year earnings has risen almost 25% over the past 90 days to $2.13/share, earning Salesforce a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

241,CDNS,"Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) delivered third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure rose 10% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 4.4% year over year to $12.463 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.421 billion. Acquisitions contributed 120 basis points (bps) to revenue growth in the quarter.Strength witnessed in company’s Security and Applications segments drove year-over-year growth. Order strength and improving traction of the subscription-based model were other tailwinds.Top-line DetailsProducts (74.7% of total revenues) increased 4.7% to $9.30 billion.Services (25.3%) advanced 3.4% to $3.16 billion. This was driven by growth in software and solutions services.Almost 32% of the revenues were recurring in nature gaining 2% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from subscriptions represent 55% of the company’s software revenues.Recurring software and subscriptions generated $5.6 billion deferred product revenues, which surged 29% from the year-ago quarter.Geographically, Americas, EMEA and APJC reported revenue growth of 2%, 9% and 7% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Total emerging markets grew 7% and the BRICs plus Mexico climbed 12%.In terms of customer segments, enterprise increased 11%, while service provider dropped 4%.

Revenue (TTM) | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteWireless, Switching Witnessed GrowthInfrastructure Platforms (57.5% of third-quarter revenues) comprise Switching, NGN routing, Wireless and Data Center solutions. Revenues inched up 2% from the year-ago quarter to $7.16 billion.The year-over-year increase was primarily due to robust growth across switching, wireless and data center business. Switching revenues increased witnessed strong growth across campus and data center. Adoption of new campus switch, Cat9K was impressive.Further, wireless revenues grew on the back of company’s Wave 2 offerings and Meraki solution. Robust demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution drove data center’s double digit growth.However, continued weakness in service provider which led a slowdown in enterprise routing business remained a headwind during the quarter.Management stated that the subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 5,800 customers, up 2,700 sequentially. Moreover, results benefited from the continuing customer shift to 100 gig architectures. Additionally, rapid adoption of multi-cloud infrastructures was a key catalyst.Cisco’s ACI solution continues to witness traction. The company believes that ACI customers are gaining from increased business agility owing to network automation, simplified management and improved security features of the product. Management remains optimistic on the newly introduced ACI SDN offering.AppDynamics Drive GrowthApplications (10.5% of third-quarter revenues) consist of Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications (“UC”), Conferencing and TelePresence, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Revenues increased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $1.31 billion.In the quarter, Cisco integrated its Cisco Spark with Webex Platform which enhanced Webex Meeting and enabled it to introduce Webex Teams, further strengthening the company’s collaboration portfolio.Collaboration revenues rose primarily driven by growth across AppDynamics, UC infrastructure and TelePresence endpoints.Security Remains StrongSecurity (4.7% of revenues) climbed 11% to $583 million. The results were noticeable as deferred revenues surged 38% from the year-ago quarter.Strong growth can be attributed to solid demand witnessed by web security, unified threat and advanced threat solutions.Cisco’s AI-driven Talos intelligence platform blocks 20 billion threats per day. The company is striving to leverage machine-learning to deploy security platforms to mitigate online risks on a real-time basis.Other ProductsOther Products segment (2% of revenues) contains service provider video, cloud and system management and various emerging technology offerings. Revenues fell 6% to $249 million.A positive development pertaining to the sector is the recent divestiture of a portion of company’s previously acquired NDS video assets. This move is likely to mitigate the sluggishness persistent in this segment.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 40 bps from the year-ago quarter to 63.9%. Management claims that the decrease can be attribute to higher memory pricing. This is anticipated to persist in the near term.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $4.05 billion, up 5.7% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, expanded 40 bps to 32.5%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 80 bps to 31.5%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCisco exited the third quarter with cash & cash equivalents and investments balance of almost $54.43 billion down from $67.97 billion in the prior-year quarter. Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the United States at the end of quarter were $47.5 billion. The company generated $2.42 billion cash flow from operations down from the year-ago figure of $3.3 billion.In the third quarter, Cisco repurchased approximately 140 million shares of common stock for $6.02 billion, translating to an average price of $42.83 per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at 68 cents, translating to year-over-year growth of 11.5%.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 63-64%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29.5% and 30.5% for the quarter.ConclusionWith Webex Meetings, Webex Devices and Webex Teams yielding results, we believe Cisco is well poised to capitalize on the emerging AI-based enterprise applications.The company recently closed the acquisition of Accompany for $270 million. The newly acquired company is set to join Collaboration Technology Group (“CTG”) of Cisco. Accompany’s robust enterprise AI capabilities will strengthen Cisco’s collaboration portfolio.We believe that company’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market holds promise. Security solutions of Cisco are likely to witness traction, going forward. The company’s extended partnerships with the likes of Aon, Allianz and Rackspace are likely to boost security segment growth.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind. Moreover, ongoing transition to subscription-based model will continue to hurt the top line. Arista’s (ANET  -  Free Report) recent intention of manufacturing switches that connect campus networks is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that market.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

242,CDNS,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in SYMC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 13 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.82 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.60.Also, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents a share from 41 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 20% in the past month.Symantec Corporation Price and Consensus Symantec Corporation Price and Consensus | Symantec Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer – Software industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pegasystems Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pegasystems Inc. QuoteConclusionPegasystems faces intense competition from other Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) software providers in the market. In order to survive as well as strengthen its position the company is transitioning to a cloud-based subscription model.However, the increasing expenses accompanying the shift as well as in product launches are limiting growth, considering near term outlook. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange rate keeps the analysts cautious. Furthermore, maintaining fiscal 2018 outlook raises questions given the prospects of CRM.Per a recent report by Gartner, worldwide CRM software revenues in 2017 came in at $39.5 billion, becoming the largest software market in the year. For 2018, CRM software market revenue is projected to grow at 16%, making it the fastest growing software market.We believe in order to capitalize this growth opportunity Pegasystems needs to pull up its socks as soon as possible.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Pegasystems has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the industry are Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report), Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) and SAP (SAP  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

246,CDNS,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company’s continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company’s shares rebound going forward. Notably, Synopsys has rallied 16.1% over the past year, underperforming the 30.4% surge of the industry it belongs to.Additionally, the company’s raised fiscal 2018 guidance is encouraging. The company’s recent acquisitions of Black Duck Software and Kilopass Technology are expected to boost the top line in the long run. Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics are other concerns.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Western Digital have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 19%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

251,CDNS,"Fresh volatility in the tech sector over the past two months has seen investors start to ditch previously-hot stocks with stretched valuations. One example of this trend is Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report), which has sold off significantly after a dramatic rise to all-time highs earlier this year. If this tech volatility sticks around, it could be best to avoid these stocks right now.Cadence Design Systems offers products and tools that help customers to design electronic products. For example, the company’s core electronic design automation software and services enable engineers to develop different types of IC design blocks to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.CDNS has slumped more than 21% since touching a new peak in late January, but the company’s valuation still seems stretched. Meanwhile, the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recent analyst estimates might cause further hesitation.Latest Earnings OutlookCadence is expected to release its latest quarterly financial results in late April. Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect the company to post adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share and total revenues of $505.8 million.These results would actually represent respectable year-over-year improvements of 19% and 6%, respectively. However, analyst sentiment for this period—and future fiscal periods—has been less optimistic recently.When looking at the Most Accurate Estimate, which only considers the most recent analyst estimates, we see that Cadence’s earnings projection is one penny lower for the soon-to-be-reported quarter and three cents lower for the upcoming quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is also a penny lower for the company’s full-year and next-year earnings estimates.Since earnings estimates and analyst sentiment have such a profound effect on a stock’s momentum, this worsening outlook is not a great sign.Key Valuation MetricsAs mentioned, CDNS has slumped more than 21% over the past two months, but the company’s valuation is still stretched. Based on Friday’s close, Cadence was trading at 23.5x forward 12-month earnings, which is a premium compared to the broader technology sector.The stock also has a P/S of 5.4, which means its shares are looking overvalued based on the company’s revenue picture too. Investors love to look at the P/S ratio for these smaller software and tech firms because having a strong customer base is precious in this space, so it is discouraging to see this valuation metric at this level too.The bottom line is that investors have been quick to ditch these companies with stretched valuations in the recent tech selloff, and stocks with sluggish earnings outlooks are likely to be punished even further.Want more market analysis from this author?

252,CDNS,"The technology sector is now in the spotlight as we head into the busiest week of the Q3 earnings cycle.According to the Zacks Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members or 24.7% of the index’s total membership have reported quarterly numbers as of Oct 20. Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally witness back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutshineTechnology is one of the four sectors expected to report impressive earnings growth. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction. Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How GOOGL, MSFT, INTC, CDNS and VRSN are PlacedThe world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, represent almost flat growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker’s competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia’s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment. (Read: Will Competition From Nvidia and AMD Hurt Intel's Earnings?)However, we anticipate the company’s strong growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment’s growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel’s Data Center business will expand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6%. As Intel’s data-center business accounts for nearly half of the company’s operating margin, the benefit of increase in segment’s revenues will trickle down to the bottom line as well.We expect Alphabet’s third-quarter 2017 results to benefit from strength in paid clicks, solid advertising revenues, mobile search ads and increasing momentum in the Other Bets segment. Also, increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will drive top-line growth.We expect paid clicks to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the heightening online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.The company’s advertising revenues will likely be driven by healthy growth in its mobile search ads, YouTube ads and programmatic advertising. Furthermore, given an encouraging performance of the Other Bets segment during the second quarter, we estimate the segment to continue its momentum this quarter as well.In addition to this, the increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top-line growth in the upcoming quarter. (Read: Will Paid Clicks Help Alphabet Beat on Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $21.94 billion for the quarter under review, up 20.1% from third-quarter 2016. Moreover, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.39 per share and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alphabet Inc. QuoteLet’s take a sneak peek at Microsoft which is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Microsoft’s cloud computing service — Azure — has been the major growth driver in recent times. In the last quarter, Azure revenues soared a whopping 94% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. We believe robust adoption of this cloud computing service will continue to drive the company’s top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. According to data from Synergy Research, Azure trailed only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in terms of market share and revenue growth in the cloud infrastructure services market.Also, Microsoft now leads the enterprise SaaS market that gained almost 31% year over year to reach $15 billion in quarterly revenues. The outperformance was attributed to the buyout of LinkedIn that contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the last quarter. Microsoft projects approximately $1.1 billion of revenues from LinkedIn in the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, we note that strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption are other growth drivers for the quarter. (Read: Microsoft's Q1 Earnings to Benefit From Azure Growth)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $23.53 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 15% from the year-earlier quarter. In addition, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3.Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAnother tech company, VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is also set to report its quarterly numbers. We expect this Zacks Rank #3 company to post earnings of 98 cents per share and revenues of $291.78 million, marking year-over-year growth of 5% and 1.5%, respectively.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as international markets. Reportedly, in the last quarter, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Thus, strong gTLD growth, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results, in our view. We believe increasing domain name registration, along with price hikes for domain names, will drive the top line.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and escalating operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds. (Read: VeriSign Q3 Earnings: Is Another Beat in the Cards?)Lastly, Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) is another company scheduled to release earnings numbers. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this Zacks Rank #3 company is likely to report earnings of 34 cents on $482.39 million revenues. Earnings and revenue estimates represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 8.1%, respectively.We believe Cadence’s third-quarter results will be driven by a number of projects won during the period. The company’s Genus Synthesis Solution was used by Toshiba Electronic Devices and Storage Corporation for the tapeout of ASIC designing.

255,CDNS,"Technology sector earnings gain steam in this week of the Q4 reporting cycle. Notably, the technology sector has been witnessing an upside since the last year on the back of innovative ideas and technological advancements.

257,CDNS,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Cadence have returned 69.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry's growth of 34.9%.What's Going in Favor of Cadence?Cadence is benefiting from ongoing adoption of its digital and signoff, custom-analog and IP solutions as well as expanding customer base.Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.Market research firm IDC estimates global IoT spending to grow at a CAGR of 15.6% over 2015-2020 time frame to hit $1.29 trillion in 2020. Moreover, the firm estimates AR/VR spending to accelerate at a CAGR of 198% over the same period to reach $143.3 billion in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for semiconductor chip makers as well as electronics sensor developers. We note that these two industries make the majority of customer base. We believe that the company’s expanding product portfolio will help it to win frequent orders as well as new customers from these emerging markets going ahead.The company has also introduced a broad portfolio of interface and memory design IP solutions for automotive applications using TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Compact process. We note that the expansion of Renesas agreement reflects the company’s growing influence in the autonomous vehicle market. Of late, the company has won orders from well-known companies like MobilEye and Infineon who are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) related technologies. This is a prudent step given the significant growth prospect of the ADAS market, which is estimated to be worth $42.40 billion by 2021, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.We also note that the company is focused on augmenting footprint in the aerospace and defense segment. Apart from having a dedicated team for the sector, Cadence has expanded systems business through partnerships with established sector players like Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and GE Aviation. We believe that these partnerships will help in driving the company’s market position in the long run.Notably, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.9% in the last quarter. Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12%.Risks PersistHowever, intensifying competition, currency volatility, leveraged balance sheet and stretched valuation remain major headwinds.We note that Cadence currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 12.17, which compares unfavorably with what the industry observed to some extent, in the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 11.38 and is closer to the high end of the valuation range. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock at the moment.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCadence carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

263,CDNS,"U.S. small-caps have been continuously lagging their large-cap counterparts this year. Although small-cap stocks have had a disappointing earnings season, large-cap stocks have been gaining on strong earnings, currency effects and higher growth prospects, internationally.

Tax cuts will be highly beneficial to small-caps as they are not subject to different tax regimes owing to their domestic focus and thus end up paying higher taxes (read: 2 Steady Sector ETFs Amid August's Market Crash).The U.S. economy faces high geopolitical risks owing to rising tensions with North Korea.

264,CDNS,"Continuing its earnings streak for the sixth consecutive quarter, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report), yesterday, delivered splendid third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines both came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported adjusted earnings per share (excluding all one-time items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 84 cents, which came in 37.7% higher than the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 61 cents. On a non-GAAP basis (excluding all one-time items), earnings came in at 92 cents per share, up from 76 cents posted in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 69 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management. The company’s third-quarter revenues jumped 13% year over year to $695.4 million and came toward the higher-end of the previously guided range of $685-$700 million (mid-point $692.5 million).Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $690 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys’ products, and strength in IP and hardware products. About 90% of the revenues came from the backlog in the beginning of the quarter and the remaining 10% was contributed by a customer.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys were down as much as 3.3% during yesterday’s after-hour trade, before settling down at 1.4%. This may be due to the fact that the company’s non-GAAP earnings came in toward the lower-end of the previously provided guidance range of 91-94 cents.Nonetheless, Synopsys stock has gained 34.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter in DetailSegment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $603.8 million, up nearly 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.

268,CDNS,"2017 has been the year of the tech stock. Across nearly every industry of the technology sector, shares have soared on the back of increased demand and shifting consumer habits. Interestingly, one of the most in-demand segments of the tech market this year has been enterprise software, largely due to widespread adoption of new technologies by large businesses and corporations.As we head into the New Year, enterprise software companies look poised for another strong run. Cloud computing is continuing to get more affordable, and the advent of artificial intelligence presents new uses for large chunks of data. This could help enterprise tech firms become the hottest stocks in the tech sector throughout 2018.With that said, check out these three enterprise software stocks to buy now:1.       Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report)Cadence is a leading designer of electronic design automation software and produces solutions for semiconductors, computer systems, and consumer electronics, among other things. Cadence shares have been on a strong two-year run, including a 73.5% surge in 2017 alone. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Based on our current consensus estimates, Cadence is expected to finish its current fiscal year with earnings growth of 15.5%. The company’s earnings are projected to swell an additional 7.9% next year. The stock’s P/E of 31.31 is a bit bloated, but it actually comes in lower than the “Computer – Software” industry’s average, so investors could be getting a comparatively decent price for CDNS right now. 2.       Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report)Red Hat is a leading provider of open-source software and enterprise IT solutions, including cloud computing. The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings. Red Hat just surpassed earnings estimates again and remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of the software firm actually slipped in the wake of the company’s earnings and revenue beat, but we think this could be an opportunity to buy on the dip. Subscription revenue for app development and emerging tech, a key growth catalyst for the company, was up 44%. And guidance for the upcoming quarter was higher than analyst expectations. 3.       Splunk Inc. (SPLK  -  Free Report)Splunk provides a software platform, which collects and indexes data and enables users to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time. The stock is up over 64% this year and is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Splunk is an exciting pick for growth investors and currently rocks an “A” grade in the Growth category of our Style Scores system.

Black Duck is a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. The deal was valued at $547 million net of cash acquired.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries.

The addition of Black Duck’s software solutions will detect known security vulnerabilities affecting open source code and also generate alerts for the same. This will improve the effectiveness of Synopsys’ solutions.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteAcquisitions: A Key Growth DriverAcquisitions are central to Synopsys’ growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Intense competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corporation has made the EDA market tougher to penetrate. Synopsys’ acquisitions have helped it to boost revenues.Most recently, Synopsys acquired Forcheck, which offers static code analysis tools in Fortran applications. These tools meet the industry coding standards and compliances. Prior to that, the company had added Cigital, Codiscope and Simpleware to its kitty.The acquisitions have expanded the company’s product suite thereby driving the company’s top line. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter revenues that jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million.Synopsys stock has gained 52.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 35.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Influencing Synopsys’ PerformanceWe believe unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys are likely to drive near-term performance of the company. The company’s recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead.However, a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. Moreover, escalating costs and expenses, which are putting pressure on margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Further, customer concentration risk remains a huge concern for the company. Additionally, a substantial portion of the company’s revenues are generated from outside the United States. This might adversely impact the top line due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and an uncertain macroeconomic environment.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSynopsys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some top-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector are Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

272,CDNS,"The second-quarter reporting cycle has begun and 54 S&P 500 members, representing 16.9% of the index’s total market capitalization, have already reported their results.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings of these companies are up 11.9% on a year-over-year basis (79.6% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue is up 5.5% on a year-over-year basis (72.2% of the companies also beat top-line estimates).Overall second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 7.2% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 4.5%.Technology Earnings ExpectationsTechnology is one of the five sectors projected to report the highest growth in the second quarter. The other four are Energy, Aerospace, Construction and Industrial Products.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software. Earnings for the technology sector are anticipated to be up 10.1%.Let’s take a sneak peek into four technology companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jul 24:Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) is unlikely to beat second-quarter 2017 expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -3.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) to deliver an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, we note that Alphabet beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 5.74%.We believe Alphabet’s strengths in mobile platform, YouTube and cloud will play important roles.

It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 2.8%.We believe opportunities in higher growth areas like automotive, cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and aerospace & defense are a positive for the company.Cadence’s second-quarter guidance was unimpressive. Management noted increased variability in quarter to quarter results due to growing portion of hardware and IP in the business mix. (Read More: Cadence Set to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)Notably, its shares have gained 38.9% on a year-to-date basis in contrast to its industry’s gain of 23.4%.Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS  -  Free Report) is also not expected to beat second-quarter 2017 estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of an Earnings ESP of -24.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.Notably, Scientific Games has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the four preceding quarters with an average negative surprise of 2.9%.Shares have gained a massive 91.8% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s gain of 11.7%.However, Logitech International S.A.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 57 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys fell as much as 3.4%, yesterday.

Also, as a percentage of revenues, the same increased 430 basis points (bps) from the year-earlier quarter to 81.3%.  The increase in total cost and expenses were primarily due to higher costs related with acquisitions, employee compensation and cost of goods sold for hardware sales.Synopsys’ non-GAAP operating income was down 9.9% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $130.6 million. Operating margin also contracted 420 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.1%.

Revenues as well as earnings improved year over year, mainly due to strength in hardware and IP products. Additionally, the company’s first-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company’s recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIAand Intel have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 11.2% and 8.4%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

276,CDNS,"The liquidity of a company often indicates whether its business is going in a profitable direction. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 13.Here are six of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

277,CDNS,"Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29. The company has a decent earnings surprise history having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on two occasions in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company’s sustained focus on introducing new products is expected to continue boosting revenues. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support are likely to drive forthcoming results.Also, Synopsys’ time-based license revenue model under which customers effectively rent the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee is impressive.  Notably, this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, acquisitions are central to the company’s growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies as well as diversify and broaden product portfolio. In fact, the company’s continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.In September, Synopsys had completed the acquisition of QuantumWise. This buyout has not only enhanced the company’s capabilities but has also gained it QuantumWise’s customers. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to boost the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.However, a challenging technology spending environment, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies, and competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corp., remain near-term headwinds.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Synopsys’ has an Earnings ESP of -1.22%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pure Storage, Inc.

Cadence’s extended partnership with a prominent memory chip maker in Asia for LPDDR4, PCI Express Gen4, NAND flash PHYs and Tensilica DSPs, is also a key driver.The newly launched Protium S1 FPGA-based prototyping system is also gaining widespread traction as evident from 17 purchases of the product during the third quarter, including nine repeat orders.Notably, the company delivered an IP portfolio for the automotive design of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) 16nm FinFET Compact (16FFC) technology and also collaborated with it for design innovation of 7nm FinFET Plus for high-performance computing (HPC) systems.We also believe that increasing investments in emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company.Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

279,CDNS,"It has been nearly two weeks that Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Ever since Symantec reported its quarterly numbers on Nov 1, the company’s shares have lost more than 13%.The downtrend stemmed from the company’s dismal second-quarter results wherein its top and bottom line both fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, revenues were in line with the mid-point of the company’s guidance range, while non-GAAP earnings came in at the lower end.In addition to this, the cybersecurity company issued disappointing guidance for the next quarter’s revenues and earnings, as both fell short of the respective consensus estimates. Moreover, the company’s dismal outlook for the full fiscal makes investors worried about its near-term performance.Notably, Symantec has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 17.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 36.1% during the same time frame.Unfavorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing Symantec’s dismal performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend as analysts decreased their estimates. Analysts polled by Zacks are convinced that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock may witness a lackluster performance in the future as well. Over the past 30 days, the Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 moved down by 6 cents and 11 cents, respectively.What’s Bothering Analysts?Analysts covering the stock are cautious about Symantec’s future performance due to the factors highlighted by management during the fiscal second-quarter earnings conference call. The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter.Per Symantec, “Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals.”The company expects the aforementioned factors will continue to impact its near-term results. Therefore, it lowered its revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.Looking aheadApart from the booking mix issue, there is another factor which makes us increasingly cautious about Symantec’s near-term performance. It should be noted that last month the company announced accomplishing the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc. This move is believed to be Symantec’s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.However, we believe that although the sale of the company’s certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet, the loss of high-margin business might hurt Symantec’s near-term profitability.Therefore, we suggest investors to stay away from investing in this stock till we find a better visibility on the company’s growth opportunities.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are Blackbaud, Inc.

QuoteMoreover, corporate leads, social media followers and unique visitors to insperity.com increased more than 30% in the reported quarter.Insperity’s stock has returned 38.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 18.2% rally of the industry.Operating DetailsGross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 17.6%. Gross profit per worksite employee per month increased 7.8% to $250.Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.5% year over year to $43.1 million, which surpassed management’s guidance of $37.5-$39.5 million. EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 16.7% in the quarter to $63.Operating expenses rose 15.9% year over year to $110.2 million due to increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors. Continued investments in the company’s technology infrastructure, security and development also led to the upside.Share Buyback ContinuesInsperity exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $285.9 million compared with $243.8 million as on Jun 30, 2016.To-date, the company has repurchased 349,000 shares at a cost of $27 million and paid $18 million in cash dividends.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Insperity projects adjusted earnings in the range of 91-95 cents per share.

Management claims that its flagship co-employment solution, Insperity Workforce Optimization, has been the most comprehensive business service in the marketplace for many years. Additionally, the launch of Insperity Premier in the third quarter is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Moreover, improved client retention, diversified product portfolio, growth in worksite employees and strength in ancillary products are the other positives. Further, management stated that competitive positioning, gross-profit contribution, and operational excellence will drive future growth.However, an increase in health-care costs does not bode well for the company as it is one of the major components of operating expenses. Furthermore, intensifying competition remains a major concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Insperity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Adobe Systems Inc.
