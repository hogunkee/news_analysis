2,TMO,"Thanks to a Gilead-Kite merger, biotechs had a big week. They've also rallied this year and over the longer haul.XThree of the top four health sector ETFs ranked by year-to-date returns through Aug. 29 were biotech-focused, according to Morningstar Direct. The top performer, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), posted a 36.4% gain, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10.8% advance.The ETF, featured in Monday's ETF Leaders column, broke out past an 82.48 flat-base entry Thursday and remains in buy range. Shares ran up 13% from a June breakout from a flat base to the start of the just-cleared pattern. The fund, launched in January 2006, has $4.15 billion in assets and bears a 0.35% expense ratio.Coming in second is First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech (FBT), with a 31.4% YTD gain.

3,TMO,"Medical-related exchange traded funds have racked up healthy gains this year amid the ongoing quest for longer and healthier lives.One of the outperformers is iShares US Medical Devices (IHI), which gained 20.9% year to date through May 30, well ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% gain for the period. The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. Top holdings in the ETF included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average. The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index, has gathered $120.6 million in assets.Its top 10 holdings included Align Technology (ALGN), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), and accounted for about 21% of the portfolio. XHE is trading at record highs and is extended after two recent bounces off the 50-day line.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), up 14.4% this year, has an average annual gain of 21% for the past five years. The $3.2 billion fund, launched in January 2006, is forming a flat base with a 72.68 buy point. It's 2% below the entry, but still about 20% off of its July 2015 peak.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) are among top names held by XBI. The top 10 holdings make up 27% of assets.RELATED:Are You In The Best Health Care ETF? GOP Moves To Replace ObamaCareBiotech ETF Rides Industry's Recovery

5,TMO,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) finds itself near highs as most of its holdings participate in the hottest segments of the medical sector this year.Most of the 47 stocks in the fund fall into one of two IBD industry groups: medical products or medical systems and equipment. Both have been in the top 25 of 197 IBD groups for many weeks, and both have the best year-to-date performance among 14 groups that make up the medical sector.Medical systems and equipment is up about 20% as a group, while the medical products group has climbed some 15%. Since the market low of June, however, biotechs and generic-drug stocks have made much stronger gains. Still, the medical equipment subset is up 18% in that period and the products group is up 15% -- better than nearly all other health care groups.You won't find any pharmaceutical companies in iShares U.S. Medical Devices, but rather companies that provide the tools to develop drugs and to help patients deal with medical problems. Indeed, the companies' product offerings span from syringes, to heart valves, to robotic surgical systems.The ETF -- which itself is up more than 17% in 2016 -- is trying to break out past the 145.85 buy point of a flat base. If it can hold above the 50-day moving average, there's a better chance of rising past the entry. Shares had their best run of 2016 from February to early August.The ETF's chart closely resembles that of its largest holding, Medtronic (MDT). The stock has been forming a shallow base and is near new highs. Among its many products, Medtronic makes insulin pumps, ear infection treatments, coronary stents and brain-stimulus devices to treat nervous-system disorders.Thermo Fischer Scientific (TMO), the fund's second-largest holding, rallied for most of September and also is nearing new highs. The company, which is in the research equipment and services industry group, makes medical research instruments.On Sept. 19, it completed its $4.2 billion acquisition of FEI, a maker of high-performance microscopes. Acquisitions have been part of the story in the medical devices industry, though not always resulting in stock gains.Danaher (DHR) has been a drag on the portfolio. The stock was basing nicely near highs in August but started tumbling with the Sept. 6 announcement that it is acquiring Cepheid (CPHD), which makes a system for fast genetic testing, for $4 billion.Abbott Laboratories (ABT), with nearly an 8% weighting in the ETF, also hasn't been much of a contributor. Shares remain locked in a 14-month-old consolidation.IShares U.S. Medical Devices has an average annual return of 20.35% over three years and 20.81% over five years.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

6,TMO,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) touched an eight-month high intraday Thursday on reports that it received a buyout offer from rival Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), but Wall Street was skeptical.The website Street Insider cited an unnamed source saying that Thermo Fisher had made an all-stock offer for Illumina worth about $30 billion, which would be about 20% above its current market cap.Cowen analyst Doug Schenkel said that there was ""close to a 0% probability"" that this was actually true. The premium would be too low to appeal to Illumina, he argued, and too expensive for Thermo Fisher.""This would require Thermo Fisher to issue 200 million shares (assuming Thermo Fisher shares continue to not be pressured in spite of these 'reports'),"" Schenkel wrote in a research note. ""These assumptions would render the deal 20% dilutive to Thermo Fisher on a 2018 EPS basis.""Illumina stock opened slightly higher and then jumped 7.5% after the news broke mid-morning, with the shares hitting an eight-month high of 182.67. When the market closed, it was up 1.9% at 172.34. Thermo Fisher stock dipped 0.85% to 153.35.IBD'S TAKE: Illumina was once a top-rated stock, but it has fallen on hard times. Investors who saw the sell signals were able get out in time and keep their money, as we explained last fall in Investor's Corner.Wells Fargo analyst Tim Evans was also dubious.""We think the deal would encounter significant regulatory hurdles, given that Illumina holds a near monopoly in high-throughput sequencing, and Thermo Fisher Scientific is the only current competitor with material scale in desktop sequencing,"" Evans wrote in his note.He added that the overlap between the two businesses could lead to revenue ""dys-synergies,"" suggesting they may have to cut back on overlapping products.
"
7,TMO,"Illumina (ILMN) rose as much as 8% to its highest level since January after a report that Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) made a $30 billion offer for the maker of gene-sequencing equipment.The all-stock offer doesn't include a cash component, StreetInsider.com reported, citing an unnamed person with knowledge of the matter. San Diego-based Illumina rose 4% to 176 at 11:51 a.m. ET. Waltham, Mass.-based Thermo Fisher fell less than 1% to 153.73.In 2012, Illumina rejected acquisition attempts by Roche Holding (RHHBY), including one valued at $6.7 billion. Illumina's annual revenue has more than doubled since 2011, reaching $2.2 billion in 2015.Representatives for Illumina and Thermo Fisher couldn't be reached for comment.

8,TMO,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report. There was no clear explanation for the slide, other than some softness in emerging markets.Other key contributors to iShares U.S. Medical Devices are Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which makes equipment for medical research, and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), which just posted its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade. Becton Dickinson (BDX) had been trending higher, but fell sharply Thursday after it cut its full-year sales forecast, citing currency headwinds.The ETF is extended from a breakout in April and from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in June. But it remains near the 142.47 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern that formed during July. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

9,TMO,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.
"
10,TMO,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) was sliding on the stock market Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it based on negative trends in key markets.Analyst Steve Beuchaw cut his rating to underweight and lowered his price target to 110 from 130 on Illumina stock. He also lowered his valuation of the cancer franchise to $3.8 billion from $4.9 billion, citing reimbursement pressure from Medicare and Medicaid, as well of the rise of immunotherapies for cancer that don't require genetic testing.Beuchaw also described a trend in the academic research channel to outsource genome sequencing to centralized labs, reducing the need for locally installed machines. He added, however, that this wasn't a negative call on the entire genomics space.""We remain positive on share gainers in emerging categories in genomics, notably Natera (NTRA) and NanoString (NSTG) where markets are in their earlier stages of development,"" he wrote in his downgrade note. ""Qiagen (QGEN) is an emerging player in sequencing hardware, and expectations are likely too low for the GeneReader.""Beuchaw added that recovery in the genomics market seemed to be tied to microarrays, which is positive for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Agilent (A).Illumina stock fell to a five-month low of 132.65 in early trading on the stock market today; but closed down 1.5% at 138.67. Despite Beuchaw's positive remarks, the rivals were also sinking: Qiagen stock fell 2.2%, Natera lost 1.1%, Thermo Fisher retreated 1.3%, and Agilent fell 1.9%. But NanoString rose 1.6%.
"
11,TMO,"Life-science instrument giant Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) agreed to buy electron-microscope maker FEI Company (FEIC) for $4.2 billion in cash -- $107.50 a share -- on Friday, sending FEI shares soaring..""In life sciences, there is growing adoption of electron microscopy to study the structure of proteins,"" Thermo Fisher CEO Marc Casper said in a statement. ""The technologies we gain with FEI will complement our mass spectrometry leadership, putting Thermo Fisher in the best position to capitalize on this important trend.""He added that the deal will be immediately accretive to earnings. FEI is a profitable company with an IBD EPS Rank of 69, though revenue growth has been lacking the last couple of years. Casper, however, said Thermo Fisher can expand FEI into the biopharma research market, which Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken describes as ""white hot.""""Ultimately, we view this acquisition as a nice tuck-in, whereby Thermo Fisher is buying into EM (electron microscopy) at a low point in the cycle (at least we hope), likely helping to support Thermo Fisher’s core growth forecast of 4% to 6% in lieu of a slowdown in pharma spend,"" Muken wrote in an email to clients.FEI stock leapt 14.3% to 108.13 on the stock market today, slightly above the offer price. That's a two-year high and an all-time closing high. Thermo Fisher stock climbed 0.6% to 152.13 to a fresh record high.Leerink analyst Dan Leonard noted that Qiagen (QGEN), Bruker (BRKR) and Agilent (A) have all been speculated buyout targets for Thermo Fisher and might trade off on the news.""Bruker perhaps (may suffer) also because FEIC's cryo-EM technology is viewed by investors as a threat to Bruker's nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology, which comprises less than 25% of Bruker's sales,"" he added in his research note.Qiagen, Bruker and Agilent all rose less than 1% Friday.
"
12,TMO,"A busy morning of headlines fueled modest gains for the major averages early Friday, even as FEI Corp. (FEIC), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) made double-digit moves.The Nasdaq added 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial gained 0.2% apiece in the stock market today. Volume was light ahead of the Memorial Day weekend.In deal news, lab-equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) agreed to buy FEI Corp., a maker of high-end electron microscopes, for $4.2 billion in cash. Earlier this year, Thermo Fisher completed its acquisition of Affymetrix for just over $1 billion. Shares of Thermo Fisher edged higher on the news. FEI soared 14%.Early gainers in the Dow included Nike (NKE). Shares rose nearly 1%, but they are nowhere near a proper entry after several weeks of institutional selling. Earlier this week, competitor Under Armour (UA) inked an exclusive 15-year sponsorship deal with UCLA worth an estimated $280 million.On the earnings front, a couple of IBD 50 components made nice moves.Ulta Beauty soared 10% after reporting accelerating earnings and sales growth late Thursday.Veeva Systems, meanwhile, jumped 10% after the software firm delivered its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The stock is extended from a 28.05 buy point.On the downside, former leader Palo Alto Networks plunged 13% on disappointing earnings. Earnings and sales growth decelerated again, prompting negative analyst commentary.In economic news, a revision to Q1 GDP showed growth of 0.8%, slightly below the consensus estimate of 0.9%, but up from the initial reading of a 0.5% rise.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for July delivery lost 1% to $48.88 a barrel.
"
13,TMO,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.
"
14,TMO,"Shares of scientific-instrument maker Agilent Technologies (A) popped to a 15-year high above 45 in early trading Tuesday after the company beat fiscal Q2 estimates and raised guidance late Monday.The 16% earnings growth and 6% top-line growth were the highest since Q1 2012, and a vindication of CEO Michael McMullen's strategy since he attained his position just over a year ago, according to Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken.""We see Mike’s vision of superior top-line growth, an inflection in operating margins and improved free cash flow/deployment as a differentiating factor vs. LST (life-science tools) peers going forward,"" Muken wrote in a research note, raising his price target to 48 from 43 while affirming a buy rating.Agilent's peers include Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Danaher (DHR).Leerink analyst Dan Leonard raised his price target to 51 from 44 while keeping an outperform rating. He noted that in addition to lifting its organic-growth guidance for this year to 4.5%, the company had offered a glimpse into next year.""Management offered an initial view of fiscal 2017, projecting 4.5% organic revenue growth, and reiterated its commitment to target 22% operating margins,"" Leonard wrote. ""Assumptions for growth include continued momentum in biopharma and China, which are expected to sustain throughout the second half of 2016 and full-year 2017, and the C&E (chemical & energy) market bottoming out by year-end.""Agilent stock early Tuesday hit its highest point since January 2001, at 45.34, though in afternoon trading it was up just 2.5%, near 44. The move broke the stock out of a consolidation that had been going for over a year. The stock's Relative Strength and Accumulation/Distribution ratings have both been improving over the last couple of weeks, reaching 82 and B, respectively, both well above average.

16,TMO,"Stocks rose Friday, ending at session highs, as investors shrugged off disappointing economic data and comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggesting higher interest rates were on the way.The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, the S&P 500 added 0.4%, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.3%.

17,TMO,"Gene-analysis firm Affymetrix (AFFX) said Wednesday that it will engage in discussions with Origin Technologies on its bid to woo the company away from Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), and hold a shareholder vote on the matter.Late Tuesday, Origin Technologies, which was formed by former Affymetrix employees specifically to take over Affymetrix, raised its bid for the company to $17 a share, and increased its reverse termination fee to $100 million.Last week, Origin had offered $16.10 a share for Affymetrix, which the company's board rejected over the weekend on the grounds that it was funded solely by debt commitments and wouldn't be enough to cover the ""amounts required to be paid in respect of existing shares, employee equity arrangements, existing convertible notes and credit facility, and anticipated transaction expenses, including a termination fee payable to Thermo Fisher Scientific.""On Wednesday, Affymetrix's leadership reluctantly admitted that the new offer ""could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal,"" and so the company is legally required to engage with Origin and put the matter to a shareholder vote, with will take place on March 31. Later Wednesday, the company said that the board will discuss the proposal with Origin, and requested a draft of the merger agreement, documents on the financing of the deal and plans to obtain all the necessary approvals.The board still advocated that shareholders stick with the Thermo Fisher deal, which was $14 a share, or $1.3 billion in cash.Affymetrix stock rose 5.2% to 15.11 Wednesday, and shares were up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today.

21,TMO,"When the going gets tough, the tough build and monitor their ETF watch lists. When most investors are feeling skittish after a sharp stock market sell-off, the wise focus on the inevitable upside.Smart investors also consider the overall direction of the market when making buy and sell decisions. The IBD market direction recently shifted to correction status again.So it's time for active ETF investors to be cautious. Even several of last year's ETF winners have sunk below their 50-day moving averages, a key support level.But cautious doesn't mean idle. Several sector equity ETFs tracked by IBD are within 10% of their buy points. Buying ETFs and stocks as they break out above buy points in price chart basing formations increases the chances of nailing big gains. Here are three ETFs worth getting to know while waiting for the stock market trend to turn bullish again:SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) holds 42 equal-weighted stocks. A behemoth like Intel (INTC) has roughly the same stake of portfolio assets as smaller but top-notch players such as Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).The ETF has an average daily trading volume of roughly 172,000 shares. Its IBD RS Rating of 82 means its price performance has surpassed most stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.XSD is 7% from a 45.72 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It consolidated after hitting a 52-week high of 46.48 in June, but has rallied significantly from an interim September low.Last year, XSD pegged a 10% gain.Global X Social Media (SOCL) holds 30 stocks including LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook (FB) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).The ETF has an average daily volume of about 87,000 shares. It has an RS Rating of 81.SOCL is 5% off a 20.74 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It rallied off its 50-day line in the first and second quarters of 2015, then fell into a long consolidation.Over the full course of 2015, SOCL jumped 10%.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) targets the niche of medical device manufacturers and distributors. It holds 50 stocks, with the biggest positions in Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO).The ETF trades roughly 88,000 shares a day on average. It has an RS Rating of 79.IHI is 6% from a 127.92 buy point, but sliced through the key 50-day and 200-day support levels amid broad losses on the stock market Monday.In 2015, IHI bagged a 10% gain.

23,TMO,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Tuesday but missed on revenue for the first time in six years, sending shares down 9.5% in after-hours trading.Illumina (ILMN) said income excluding one-time items amounted to 80 cents a share, up 41% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 21% to $539 million, about $3 million short of consensus. That was the third straight quarter of decelerating sales growth.On a constant-currency basis, sales rose 25%, the company said.Illumina affirmed its full-year guidance for 20% sales growth, including a 3% impact from foreign-exchange rates. The firm raised its full-year EPS range by 3 cents to $3.39 to $3.45, but that was still on the low side of analysts' $3.44 consensus estimate.Expectations seemed to be high going in, as the stock hit a new high of 242.37 on Monday. On Tuesday it grew wobbly, however, closing down just shy of 1% in the regular session, at 237.54.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken noted that this is the first time Illumina missed Wall Street's revenue expectations since 2009, and that management has raised its revenue guidance 80% of the time in past Q2 reports. The Street had been widely anticipating a beat-and-raise, Muken wrote in an email to clients Tuesday.""Despite the top-line shortfall, strong operating-margin pull-through allowed for a modest EPS beat and enabled a slight upward tweak to guidance,"" he added.Instrument Sales Down Vs. Q1It was also the first time in more than two years that instrument revenue declined sequentially, Muken pointed out. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Illumina President Francis deSouza said instrument sales overall rose 13% year over year, but shipments of the high-end HiSeq X gene sequencer had fallen compared with last year, when the product had just been rolled out with much fanfare. On the other hand, the lower-end NextSeq and MySeq were continuing to grow nicely, he said. Overall, sequencing revenue grew 28%.CEO Jay Flatley said that another growth area was reproductive health, a field Illumina entered by acquisition a few years ago.""Sales to IVF (in vitro fertilization) laboratories increased 25% in Q2, with approximately 20% of sales coming from VeriSeq PGS,"" said Flatley. ""As a reminder, VeriSeq PGS (is) our sequencing-based, pre-implantation genetic sequencing solution used as laboratories transition from the older arrays.""Total NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) revenue grew more than 50% vs. the second quarter of last year. This result was due in part to a doubling of test send-out samples, as well as an increase in product sales to NIPT providers globally.""Flatley also praised the 35% growth in shipments to oncology customers, a customer base that Illumina has been trying to expand lately.Illumina has launched a special cancer panel and liquid biopsy program to serve this market.But revenue from microarrays, the oldest and lowest-end of Illumina's businesses, shrank 11%.Volume actually grew 29% in that business, Flatley said, but the pricing environment was harsh.Illumina has been facing more competition in that area lately from players such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Roche (RHHBY).

26,TMO,"Genomics firm Illumina (ILMN) dipped Monday on news of a competing high-end gene sequencer, while lower-end rival Bio-Reference Laboratories (BRLI) rose despite missing quarterly expectations.At the European Human Genetics Conference over the weekend, Complete Genomics, a unit of BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute), previewed its Revolocity sequencing system, a ""supersequencer"" designed to deliver as many as 30,000 whole genome sequences per year. This high volume, Leerink analyst Dan Leonard said in a research note Monday, will enable sequencing at a cost of about $1,000 per genome, a landmark that Illumina first hit with its HiSeq X system rolled out last year.Leonard noted that while Illumina has several competitors in small-scale, targeted sequencing, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Qiagen (QGEN) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO), Revolocity will be the first high-throughput rival.""We believe the biggest promised differentiating feature of the Complete Genomics system is the sample-to-answer capability of the workflow,"" Leonard wrote. ""BGI promises to enable users to input genomic DNA, blood or saliva, and walk away; the instrument proposes to automate the sequencing process from sample prep to basic data analysis/variant calls.""Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note, however, that Illumina is a tough competitor.""To Illumina's credit, they have thwarted most if not all challengers efficiently and are certain to have anticipated this launch, given their constant paranoia,"" Muken wrote in a research report Monday. ""Thus for now we view these updates with a skeptical eye, although we do acknowledge that this launch has the potential to modestly impact near-term ordering patterns (manufacturing not yet up to commercial scale, and thus Complete likely hoped to delay purchases via early reveal) and possibly shift a small amount of share (2 customers already announced).""Illumina stock recorded a new high close of 210.21 Friday; but in late-morning trading on the stock market today, it was down a fraction, near 209.Meanwhile, Bio-Reference Labs stock was up more than 7%, even though its fiscal Q2 report was soft. The company's revenue climbed 11% over the year-earlier quarter to $224 million, about $4 million short of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Profit rose 3% to 38 cents a share, missing estimates by 5 cents.Nonetheless, in a statement, Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman highlighted the growth in his firm's sequencing business, which was a key selling point in its $1.47 billion sale to Opko Health (OPK), announced last week. Opko stock was up more than 5% in late-morning trading Monday.""Over 23,000 patients for sequencing tests were referred to us under (Bio-Reference genetics lab) GeneDx requisitions, not including those from other Bio-Reference business units in Women's Health and Oncology,"" Grodman said. ""This is an increase of 54%. This increase could have been higher if there had not been the impact of higher deductible plans, an impact we expect to lessen as we continue through the calendar year.""Opko and Bio-Reference said that they'll hold a conference call to discuss their merger Thursday morning, in lieu of an earnings call Monday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

84,TMO,"Two California-based stocks that spent a long time consolidating could present fresh opportunities to Big Cap 20 investors.LinkedIn (LNKD), which has its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., advanced out of two bases in 2013.The first breakout in January 2013 led to a 73% gain in about four months. The second breakout in July 2012 led to a 27% gain in two months.There was no third-stage base, though for a time a flat base appeared to be forming. Following sound rules sometimes seems like a drag, but LinkedIn punished those who either bought before the base was complete or bought before the breakout.The consolidation fell a week shy of a valid base, and the breakout never came.Instead of a new base, LinkedIn's action proved to be the start of a long consolidation that sank 47% off its September high. The decline was deeper than bulls would prefer. However, LinkedIn has climbed high enough that if it formed a handle now, it likely would be valid.The midpoint of the consolidation is 196.79, and the stock is trading above that price.Up-down volume is at 1.6, far above the 1.0 neutral level. The Accumulation/Distribution level is B, pointing to institutional buying.LinkedIn's fundamentals are improving. In Q2, the company reported a 34% pop in earnings, well above the Street's consensus estimate for a less than 3% gain. Revenue grew 47% vs. views for a 40.5% increase.Annual earnings are expected to rise 16% this year and 47% next year. Both percentages represent upward revisions. Revenue is expected to jump 42% and 33% in the same periods.The concern among bulls is whether LinkedIn can overcome the remaining overhead resistance. This refers to investors who bought high on the left side of the base and may be tempted to exit as the stock approaches break-even.However, the long and deep consolidation may have already scared out many of the weak holders.Apple (AAPL) began working on a base in September 2012 and consolidated for about a year and a half before breaking out.The stock sketched a handle in December 2013 but consolidated further until clearing the 82.26 buy point in April.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is finding support on its first trip to the 10-week moving average line since the breakout. A bounce off the line in strong volume hasn't developed yet but could define a buy range.Earnings growth was 20% in the most recent quarter, topping views for a 15% increase.Another stock showing positive action is Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO).The saucer-with-handle base offers a potential buy point at 127.31.

169,TMO,"The first-quarter earnings season saw a starry start with most of the 87 S&P 500 members beating earnings and maintaining revenue momentum as of Apr 20. However, the number of positive revenue surprises is lagging the preceding year’s numbers but is on par with the sequential figures.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported so far are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of the total, 82.8% beat earnings and 67.8% surpassed revenue estimates. This week, 178 S&P 500 members are lined up to release their quarterly results. We expect to get a clearer picture of what the first-quarter earnings season has in the offing by the end of the week.Medical Sector in a SnapshotMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among many other changes, slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among inventors.The Medical Product space, which is part of the broader Medical sector, has been hogging a lot of limelight on certain favorable developments. Considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong.Further, the Senate’s decision to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax for another couple of years, known as the Medical Device tax, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.Moreover, MedTech companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, growing consolidation and focus on emerging market.Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks scheduled to release results on Apr 25:Per the quantitative Zacks model, stocks with the advantageous combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of beating estimates.

170,TMO,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.89%. Moreover, Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.08%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand. Particularly, the company’s acquisition of FEI has been largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio over the past year. The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study as well as facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly, $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Quote Following the completion of the deal, the company has launched a host of products and expanded its Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform within the scope of material science applications. This should also get reflected in first-quarter 2018 performance.Apart from FEI-related development, another notable unveiling in the company’s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors called the iQ Series. This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. This in turn is likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Waltham MA-based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the period to be reported, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as a robust volume expansion plus productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at $1.138 billion, higher than the year-ago figure of $1.05 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s first-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the first quarter.The company had spent $900 million on research and development in 2017 and the same trend is continuing through 2018. We expect all innovations and product introductions to substantially drive the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also leads to solid results. Recent standout contributors are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain a bullish momentum for 2018.Moreover, growth is estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher facing a foreign exchange headwind on 2018 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition consistently poses challenges to the stock’s value.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Thermo Fisher has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of -1.29%, which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. This is because a company needs positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus this combination does not suggest that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to outpace expectations this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

171,TMO,"On Mar 27, we issued an updated research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). The company boasts strong international operations and has witnessed consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific and emerging markets. However, the company’s earnings have been affected by unfavorable foreign exchange over the last few quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading scientific instrument maker has been outperforming its industry in the past year. The stock has rallied 34.2% compared with 21.9% gain of the industry.Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher has been witnessing solid growth globally on strong expansion.  The company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and other regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the standout contributors were China, India and South Korea.  China led the way with growth in the high teens. The company opened two customer demo centers in the region, reflecting the company’s leading position in the electron microscopy and precision medicine space. The company has also invested significantly in its digital capabilities. In India, the company is currently working on tapping into growth opportunities in biopharma, healthcare and food safety markets.As part of its strategy to effectively deploy capital, Thermo Fisher has undertaken several acquisitions in the recent past. Apart from boosting revenues, these deals have driven the operating margin while also resulting in tax synergies. In this regard, Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of FEI Company has started to boost its analytical instruments portfolio.Also in 2017, the company spent $7.8 billion on acquisitions, adding leading biopharma contract development and manufacturing services through Patheon buyout. Significantly enhancing the company’s value proposition for biopharma customers, Patheon has started to contribute to Thermo Fisher’s laboratory products and services segment.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives a huge portion of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. In the past several years, the company’s earnings were affected by adverse currency movements to a great extent. These apart, competitive headwinds and rising operating costs pose a threat.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

Following its extended alliance with Interpace Diagnostics (IDXG  -  Free Report) announced earlier this week, LabCorp has formed of one more  joint venture — this time with Appalachian Regional Healthcare.This multi-year, comprehensive laboratory collaboration will help LabCorp provide high-quality, high-value and standardized laboratory diagnostics to Appalachian Regional Healthcare’s hospital-based labs.

179,TMO,"On Oct 13, we issued an updated research report on Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report), a leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of price return performance, over the past month, the stock remained in line with the broader industry.We expect this trend to improve on balanced growth across all four operating segments of Henry Schein. We are also encouraged by the company’s efforts to grow internationally. Apart from North America and Europe, it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland. Also, the company continues to ride high within its dental business on majorly accretive strategic mergers and integrations. One colossal merger in this field is Poland-based Dental Cremer in 2016.Henry Schein Animal Health’s revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions. At the beginning of 2017, the company had made a foray in the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew. Around the same time, the company announced its decision to acquire Southern SAS, which in turn might benefit its dental business through controlled and non-controlled pharmaceuticals as well as surgical supplies.Also, Henry Schein might gain from several trends in end markets like customer demographics. The increasing number of lives covered, following healthcare reforms in the United States, is likely to boost the company. Additionally, Henry Schein gains traction in animal health business on the back of tailwinds in North America as well as overseas markets. The burgeoning demand for animal health products in the United States should further drive the company’s growth. On the flip side, escalating costs and expenses continue to be a drag on the company’s margins and the bottom line. A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on Henry Schein’s stock.Key StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

182,TMO,"On Jun 7, we initiated a research report on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company delivering a robust performance overseas, while a tough competitive landscape is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This California-based manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has been outperforming its industry over the past year. The stock has gained 30.7% versus the industry’s 15.3% rise. Bio-Rad kick-started 2018 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues rising year over year in the first quarter. The company has been strongly progressing with its efforts to strengthen its hold in other geographies. In first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad derived around 62% of its net sales globally. The company delivered robust performance, primarily in North America, China and the Asia-Pacific region.Further, constant currency sales at the Life Science segment were particularly strong in North America, China and Europe, while currency-neutral sales at the company’s Clinical Diagnostics segment saw strength in China, Asia Pacific and North America.We are encouraged by the company’s active portfolio expansion for the blood typing market. In January 2018, Bio-Rad announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the IH-Incubator L and IH-Centrifuge L instruments to be used with the complete range of Bio-Rad’s IH-System Gel Reagents for manual blood typing methods.Meanwhile, Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms varying from large multinational corporations to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit its ability to switch to strategies like price increases and other drivers of cost increases.In the Life Science segment, Bio-Rad primarily competes with the likes of Becton Dickinson and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report), among others. Again, some prominent competitors in the Clinical Diagnostics segment are Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and DiaSorin.Further, Bio-Rad is exposed to risks associated with a weaker global economy and lower reimbursement rates.Key PicksA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

183,TMO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Thermo Fisher is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TMO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.67 per share for TMO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TMO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.41% heading into earnings season.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TMO has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Thermo Fisher, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

184,TMO,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jan 31. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.1%. Moreover, Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand. Particularly, the company’s acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio from the last three quarters. The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly, $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 performance.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Quote Apart from FEI-related development, another notable launch in the company’s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors called the iQ Series. This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. This in turn is likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Last but not the least, worth mentioning is the company’s recent completion of taking over the desktop scanning electron microscopy (SEM) solutions provider, Phenom-World. Thermo Fisher plans to integrate the business into its Analytical Instruments segment. Per management, addition of Phenom-World’s desktop SEM platform is projected to leverage its position in electron microscopy space and expand its entry-level plus desktop SEMs offerings for customers working in materials science, industrial manufacturing, life sciences and electronics industries.Overall, the Waltham MA-based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the period to be reported, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as robust volume expansion plus productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at $1.303 billion, higher than the sequentially last quarter’s reported figure of $1.190 billion. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s fourth-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the fourth quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through 2017. We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the fourth quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to solid results. Recent standout contributors are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition consistently imposes challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat this quarter.Zacks ESP: Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of -0.2%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Thermo Fisher’s Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $2.66 reflects a 10.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

For the current year, four estimates moved north compared with one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months.

187,TMO,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) has been in the news of late for the receipt of expanded FDA 510(k) approval for its advanced magnetic and non-invasive limb lengthening technology — PRECICE.Falling under NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO), PRECICE can now be used to treat open and closed fracture fixation, pseudoarthrosis, malunions, nonunions and bone transport. Notably, this product was earlier allowed for use in limb lengthening procedures to elongate the femur and tibia. The approval is expected to considerably drive Nuvasive’s customer base.The PRECICE platform comprises an intramedullary device that on being implanted uses an external remote controller in order to non-invasively compress and distract long bones. Per the company, the key to the PRECICE platform is the magnetic interaction between the external remote control and PRECICE intramedullary nail.Notably, NSO operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of NuVasive since the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies in 2016. NuVasive continues to gain share in its NSO portfolio, which includes MAGnetic External Control (MAGEC) for early-onset scoliosis and PRECICE technology,  both built on the MAGEC technology platform.Through this latest development, NuVasive expects to gain traction in the fast growing limb reconstruction and trauma market. A report from Allied Market Research published by Ortho Spine News on the global extremity reconstruction market substantiates this view. Per the report, the global extremity reconstruction market is expected to reach a value of $3,041 million, at a CAGR of 7.5% between 2016 and 2022.  We believe unhealthy lifestyle resulting in several joint disorders, rapidly ageing population, rising awareness, technological advancement and increased spending in healthcare by government and individuals will continue to drive the limb reconstruction and trauma market. Thus, NuVasive’s latest FDA approval will likely help it to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the niche market.Share Price MovementNuVasive has been trading below the broader industry  over last. The stock has lost 11.9% in comparison to the broader industry’s decline of 0.1%. We believe this latest development will help the company boost investors’ sentiments and reverse the downtrend.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

192,TMO,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 5.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHologic witnessed a lackluster performance at its Diagnostics segment in the last reported quarter on poor Cytology and perinatal sales. Particularly, longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals are playing spoilsport here. With the issue still to factor into the company’s performance, we expect this segment to continue to perform dull in the upcoming quarter.We are also worried about the fact that Hologic’s blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead. We expect this to get reflected through the company’s financial performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Hologic had to face several challenges owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company’s overall performance over the past few quarters. In 2017, foreign exchange headwind is expected to result in reduction of over $20 million.Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to be concerns for Hologic. For quite some time now, the company witnessed several challenges such as restricted capital spending environment, economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and increasing pricing pressure. We expect these problems to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company should get significant synergy benefits in the third quarter from the integration of Cynosure, Inc., a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which Hologic acquired in Mar 2017.  To mention, the U.S. FDA has recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, Sculpture, to treat the back and inner and outer thighs.Coming to product launches, in the third quarter, the company received European CE mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing. Also, the company announced the U.S. FDA approval of itsGenius 3D Mammography exam. These along with several other product launches should also boost the upcoming quarterly results.Overall, for third-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $790–$805 million (as compared to the prior guidance of $675–$685 million). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, within the company’s expectations.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48 cents–50 cents (beyond the high end of the previous 48 cents–46 cents range). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the company’s guidance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Hologic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hologic has a Zacks Rank #4. Note that we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:Dextera Surgical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

193,TMO,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of tools and integrated systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Illumina’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, at an average of 8.56%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the last reported first quarter of 2017, Illumina witnessed robust revenue growth on account of consistent improvement in sequencing consumables and strong demand of microarrays. While management is still emphasizing on its portfolio of sequencing platforms to fortify its market position, we expect the company to maintain top-line growth in the second quarter of 2017.Per management, top-line growth in the first quarter can also be attributed to strong uptake of the NovaSeq platform with more than 135 orders placed in this period.Moreover, with an active HiSeq customer base of roughly 800 customers, the company expects the replacement of older generation instruments by NovaSeq trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteFurther, the company recently launched VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe, a CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing based approach to noninvasive prenatal testing. Notably, outside the U.S., the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing. The Netherlands and Denmark began covering the test in the first quarter and the same is expected shortly in France. The company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well. Also, Illumina has been forging ahead with its NIPT expansion plans in China.We believe these developments will boost the company’s top line in the upcoming quarter.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the introduction of NovaSeq, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents for the company. Also, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, Illumina projects revenue growth of approximately 7%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $642.5 million. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of 65–70 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is stable at 68 cents, within the guided range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Illumina is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Illumina has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

194,TMO,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), a leading player in the medical technology space, is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 after the bell.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $1.48 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Notably, on an average, Stryker beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 2.08% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stryker is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.66% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.52 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stryker currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Stryker’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a beat.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayFor the second quarter of 2017, Stryker expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.48–$1.52. Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5% to 9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.For the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35 to $6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. The tie-up with Indo UK Institute of Health’s Medicity Program is an important factor as well. Notably, this is a 20-year partnership that aims to offer primary joint replacements (orthopedic areas of hip, knee and trauma products) and healthcare services in India at low costs.The company’s estimate revision trend is encouraging. For the current quarter, Stryker saw two upward estimate movements with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.51.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are three companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

195,TMO,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Aug 1.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.4%. The four-quarter average earnings beat is 1.0%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26%–27% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.8% in third-quarter 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7% for fourth-quarter 2017 as compared to 6.8% of the preceding quarter.  Hence, we expect the bottom-line drag to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. Notably, in the last reported quarter, currency impacted ResMed’s combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues by 3%. This is likely to dent results in the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainty is a major obstacle when it comes to the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.On the brighter side, an expanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) market is a huge opportunity for ResMed. In line with this, the company released positive data pertaining to a clinical trial related to its Home Oxygen Therapy - Home Mechanical Ventilation (HOT-HMV). The results demonstrated that COPD patients who received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home with oxygen therapy had a 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death, and stayed out of the hospital more than three times longer, compared to those who received oxygen alone. The company’s current endeavors to gain traction in the COPD market are expected to boost revenues.Further, as a major breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea, ResMed introduced AirTouch F20 full face mask with UltraSoft memory foam, which keeps patients on CPAP therapy comfortable throughout the night. AirTouch F20 is available in the U.S. and Canada now which is expected to drive the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed’s efforts to expand its business internationally are encouraging.The company’s revenue performance across all segments in the reported third quarter of 2017 was impressive. We expect the company to maintain a similar trend in this quarter.ResMed’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, the company saw one estimate move north with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. This has taken the current year estimate from $2.79 to $2.80 over the same period.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for ResMed this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  ResMed has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ResMed has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

196,TMO,"On Jan 9, we issued an updated research report on Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB  -  Free Report). Solid contribution from the Instrument and Consumable revenue platforms have been boosting Pacific Biosciences' growth trajectory. However, cutthroat competition in the niche space has been hampering Pacific Biosciences revenues. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Pacific Biosciences is a leading player in the DNA sequencing market. However, the niche space is highly competitive owing to the presence of established players like Illumina (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). Low-cost sequencing products from Illumina continue to gain traction, which is a headwind for the company. Moreover, Pacific Biosciences is a relatively small company compared with the second generation sequencing technology firms.Moreover, product launches from the likes of 10X, Oxford Nanopore, Dovetail Genomics are expected to intensify competition in the genome assembly market, which will increase pricing pressure on Pacific Biosciences over the long term.Among other major concerns, Pacific Biosciences’ sales in Europe have declined substantially on a year-over-year basis, lagging the company’s target. A number of customers in Europe have been slow in initiating the usage of Sequel systems. As a result, the company’s products witnessed poor adoption in European markets in the recent past.Further, management forecasts 8-10% rise in operating expenses for full-year 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 totaled $29.8 million compared with $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Cash and investments at the end of the third quarter was $84 million compared with $102.6 million at the end of the second quarter.On a positive note, Pacific Biosciences’ flagship platform — the Sequel system — has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. Sequel system is a nucleic acid sequencing platform based on SMRT technology that was developed in partnership with Roche. However, Pacific Bioscience’s agreement with Roche terminated earlier in 2016. The Sequel System has been a persistent contributor to Pacific Bioscience’s top line.Price PerformanceThe price movement of Pacific Biosciences has been unfavorable over the last six months. Notably, the stock has lost almost 21.1% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rally of roughly 8.8%. Further, the current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s return of 9.3%. The ongoing sluggishness in the European markets is the principal cause for the dismal price performance. Further, the company terminated its three-year long agreement with Roche Diagnostics. The collaboration provided a way to generate millions of long, single-molecule barcoded DNA fragments, averaging 10-30 kilobases that originated from much longer fragments of around 100 kilobases.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report). Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

197,TMO,"On Oct 12, we issued an updated research report on Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) — a global healthcare company dedicated toward improving life through the development of products and technologies. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, Abbott has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 11.9% as against the industry's decline of 0.8%.The market is upbeat about the several new initiatives adopted by Abbott. The latest buyout by the company is of Alere on Oct 3. Abbott has also announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States. Moreover, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR) conditional labeling for its Ellipse implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).Apart from FDA approvals and buyouts, we are upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System prospects post the receipt of full or partial reimbursement by the French Health Ministry in May 2017. At this platform, the company announced Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in June 2017. Abbott also announced that the FreeStyle Libre system is now available for reimbursement in the U.K.On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to mar growth. Management is concerned about the economic problems in Venezuela that are expected to remain unresolved for some time. Also, foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott as a considerable portion of its revenues comes from outside the United States.Key StocksA few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

198,TMO,"Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $30.93 on Oct 12, eventually closing a bit lower at $30.71. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $4.88 billion.Comparison with Broader IndustryFor the majority of the last six months, the company’s share price has considerably outperformed the broader industry. The stock has rallied 40.2% over the last six months, outshining the industry’s return of 28.9%. The company has also outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 9.8% over the last six months. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 8.5% as compared to 0.8% of the broader industry and 2.8% of the S&P 500 index.Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect Bruker to gain ground in the coming quarters.  Growth CatalystsThe 52-week high came on the back of several new developments, the most recent being the introduction of the new CE-IVD marked Fungiplex Candida fast diagnostic assay, a multiplex real-time PCR test for the rapid identification of the most common pathogens associated with invasive candidiasis. The company also introduced the CE-IVD marked MICRONAUT-AM (antimycotics) test plate for the automated or manual antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) of yeasts from cultures.Recently, Bruker introduced the timsTOF Pro system for PASEF mass spectrometry at the 16th Annual World Congress of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO). Also, Bruker announced the new D8 DISCOVER Plus X-ray diffraction (XRD) system at the Japan Analytical Scientific Instruments Show (JASIS).Bruker recently completed the buyout of MERLIN Diagnostika GmbH, located in Germany.  MERLIN has specialized skills in products, services and consulting in the fields of antibiotic resistance testing (ART) and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). This acquisition has also played a pivotal role in driving the company’s share price to a new 52-week high.Key StocksA few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

199,TMO,"A few months down the line, the Republicans will complete a full year in power. Unfortunately, since the political power change, the healthcare community hasn’t had many opportunities to rejoice.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. In fact, the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare has been raging for a while now. Per the report, it peaked when it reached the Congress in August. Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.MedTech in the United States: A Blurred PictureNeedless to say, the current crisis  in the U.S. MedTech industry, an integral part of the broader healthcare space, shows no signs of abating. A few months back, companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2.3% MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government. Unquestionably, the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory.Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources. That said, in spite of what the future may hold, we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally.Yes, you read that right. Even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been quite encouraging. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.Emerging Markets Hold Immense PromiseThe uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China, India, Latin America and others.These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity. An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Add to it, rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure, this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s Medtech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographies, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014. According to World Bank data, Guatemala increased spending by 27%, Brazil 31%, Chile 54%, Colombia 58%, Uruguay 95%, Paraguay 115%, Bolivia 138%, and Ecuador 139%. Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U.S. exporters. Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks SensibleIn such a scenario, we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network. No wonder, these stocks, cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States.Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets. It has been doing business in China for nearly 30 years and is expanding further here on the back of the Synthes acquisition. Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson & Johnson Quote Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus Abbott Laboratories price-consensus-chart | Abbott Laboratories Quote At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the last-reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic remains confident about its long-term outlook for emerging markets. The company is focused on developing new public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies.Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus Medtronic PLC price-consensus-chart | Medtronic PLC Quote Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets business registered 14% organic growth in second-quarter 2017, a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013.

The company is currently looking forward to much better performance ahead in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY in China.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus Boston Scientific Corporation price-consensus-chart | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence in emerging markets.

200,TMO,"On Oct 10, we issued an updated research report on Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last three months, this Burlington, NC-based healthcare diagnostics company, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support, has been outperforming the broader industry. The stock has lost 2% as compared with the industry’s 4.4% decline during this period. The market seems to be upbeat about the Diagnostics business, which has delivered promising performance over the recent past in spite of persistent softness within the company’s Covance drug development business.We are also encouraged by the successful closure of the acquisition of Chiltern International Group, a specialty contract research organization.Chiltern is a major partner serving the top 20 biopharma segments, helping the company focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments.  Notably, LabCorp is steadily progressing on its three-pronged strategy to drive growth. First, the company is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market.Second, LabCorp is increasingly deploying its integrated testing capabilities, industry leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers. Moreover, investors are looking forward to the long-standing strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has already demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory.Third, LabCorp’s core diagnostic strategy is based on innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. The company is also focusing on extending its core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting. On the flip side, unfavorable foreign exchange is a threat. Moreover, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape. Meanwhile, apprehensions about a tough reimbursement scenario intensifies concerns for the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

201,TMO,"On Oct 11, we issued an updated research report on New York-based DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) — a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.DENTSPLY recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY was initiated in August 2005.We feel that the deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein’s distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, DENTSPLY announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. The duo’s latest agreement extends for a period of five years which was signed in 2012.This move is also a strategic one as Pacific Dental’s network consists of over 580 centers across 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY’s dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for full-year 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.75.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.Share Price & Estimate Revisions Lack LusterDENTSPLY's estimate revision trend looks unfavorable at the moment. For the third quarter, two analysts moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Notably, the current quarter estimates dropped 1.5% to 67 cents per share over the last 60 days.DENTSPLY’s share price movement has been unfavorable over the last three months. The company shed 11.7%, much higher than the industry’s decline of 4.4%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report).

Recently, Henry Schein Animal Health announced the opening of a new National Distribution Service Center in Columbus' Brookhollow neighborhood, expanding its presence in central Ohio.  At the beginning of 2017, Henry Schein had entered the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew, a privately held distributor of animal health products.

Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategic.Over the past year, Henry Schein has underperformed the broader industry.

203,TMO,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report), a specialty retailer of health and nutrition related products, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.5%. However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average miss stands at 19.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported second-quarter 2017 revenues dropped 4.8% year over year. Apart from lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments, the decline in revenues can be attributed to an overall drop in sales of protein, vitamins, weight management and food and drink categories. In absence of any catalyst to drive growth, we expect a similar trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Moreover, GNC Holdings has a number of competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, supermarket firms and big U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which in turn, might hurt margins. GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. Quote Also, currency headwinds continue to be a growing concern for GNC Holdings. Management also expects the failure to comply with FTC regulations and changing consumer preferences to hamper business.However, on the bright side, the performance of One New GNC is improving gradually. Also, in the last reported quarter, PRO Access members doubled their visits, purchased double the products and spent significantly more in the second quarter. Banking on these factors, we expect the company to continue to gain in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well. Meanwhile, new consumer enrolment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.Earnings Whispers   Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter.

204,TMO,"The future of the U.S. healthcare space is mired in uncertainty with President Trump’s efforts to revoke the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare falling flat. This is despite the fact that the Republicans are going all out to end the policy fiasco. The investment world is equally baffled.Chances of Stability Anytime Soon?The majority of the healthcare space has heaved a sigh of relief with the recent failure of the Graham-Cassidy bill, thanks to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) latest ‘warning report’ that anticipated health coverage loss for millions of Americans due to $1 trillion in reduction in federal spending on Medicaid through 2026.Per the report, there will be considerable decrease in the number of people enrolling in Medicaid in this period for three primary reasons — “the expansion of the program established by the ACA would be repealed starting in 2020, federal reimbursement to states for Medicaid would be capped on a per-en-rollee basis beginning in 2020, and the individual mandate penalty (which induces some people to enroll in Medicaid) would be repealed upon the legislation’s enactment.”Although the President’s latest action plan indicates that the respite from Graham-Cassidy failure is short-lived, one thing is pretty clear from the entire pandemonium. Any effort to bring about a major change in the existing health insurance policy may again turn out to be futile for the Republicans.This is because, in their undying effort to fully repeal and replace Obamacare, the Republicans have never achieved a 60-40 majority. Among the related articles doing the rounds, a report by Kimberly Amadeo published in The Balance states that “Trump wanted Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act of 2010 before September 30, 2017. That's the last day Senate Republicans could pass the bill with just a 51-vote majority. That includes Vice President Mike Pence casting the final vote. But they never got the votes.”While economists are once again dissecting all the facts trying to come out with probable ways in which the ruling party can turn around, it is hard for investors keen on the medical space to settle for an investment strategy that can earn them a concrete pay.Investing Strategy to Bet OnAmid such political conundrum, while pondering on several investment mantras, the majority of investors prefer to bet on stocks, which have ability to brave the situation with their rock-solid fundamentals. However, sometimes thinking out of the box can create wonders. And we find it more logical to ask investors to consider investment options that are not dependent on the political twists and turns.We are talking about momentum investing.

205,TMO,"VWR Corporation  announced opening of a new kitting center in Skalice, Czech Republic on the eve of the company to be taken over by Avantor. Per VWR, this new 35,000 square foot facility is strategically located and will be helpful for the company’s business in the high-prospect EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region.Notably, this new center will particularly help expand Therapak’s (acquired by VWR in 2016) existing footprint in Europe with advanced facility and comprehensive kitting services for regional as well as global customers.Location wise, this new center will assist the company’s VWRCATALYST offering to grow. This apart, proximity of this site to major industrial freight carrier hubs will enhance service levels compared with VWR’s current model. The facility will be fully operational on Oct 2, 2017.Notably, VWRCATALYST Clinical and Biorepository Services lend a complete solution to its global regulated research and product development clients in the pharma, biopharma, manufacturing and clinical trial industries. Earlier in 2017, VWRCATALYST acquired laboratory and medical equipment, plus the ancillary supplier MESM and an international biorepository services organization, EPL Archives.In this regard we note that over the last couple of years, VWR’s EMEA-APAC (Asia Pacific) segment has been experiencing an increase in comparable net sales, backed by several strategic initiatives implemented in recent times. This includes  a series  of  plans  to  significantly  upgrade  its information  technology  infrastructure,  optimize  distribution network  and  modify  marketing schemes.In the recently-reported second quarter, on an organic basis, net sales in EMEA-APAC improved 2.7%. Going forward, management expects the EMEA-APAC segment to continue its run of strong historical progress.However, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. In general, VWR competes with players like Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

207,TMO,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. However, it posted an average beat of 0.03% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAhead of Boston Scientific’s earnings release, we believe, the quarter’s performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, earlier this year, the news surfaced that Boston Scientific is recalling one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe because of device malfunctions.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteThe company also delayed the submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device. While ‘LOTUS remediation work’ is currently on track, this product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This may lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within interventional cardiology, which has high chances to severely weigh on the company’s second-quarter revenue results.This apart, the severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing lately remain a concern. We note that as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind to the tune of $125 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings. Adjusted gross margin for the full year assumes a negative foreign exchange impact of 50 bps.From a positive angle, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a privately-held structural heart company.With the completion of the acquisition back in May, Boston Scientific should have already begun selling these valve systems in Europe and in other geographies outside the U.S.  The company believes that Symetis’ ACURATE group of valve products strongly complements its aortic valve platform.Integrating these technologies will not only diversify Boston Scientific’s structural heart portfolio but also provide cardiac surgeons with multiple TAVI offerings for varying patient pathologies and anatomy. We expect to see contribution from this development in the second-quarter revenue itself.Subsegments namely MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy, while Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market  levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.As stated earlier, the company’s overall second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 30–32 cents per share on revenues of $2.19–$2.22 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 31 cents, while for revenues it is $2.21 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Boston Scientific is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 31 cents.

208,TMO,"McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), one of the largest healthcare service providers, is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $3.39 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04. Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.85 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.79. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.15% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Management expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson expects earnings per share in the range of $11.75 to $12.45 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase mid-single digits year over year. Keeping in mind the last quarter performance and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteFurthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC in the quarter to be reported. In this regard, we note that the acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018.  Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson. Also, a competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of IDEXX’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.19% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Overall, IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteOn the bottom-line front, the company raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per share from the earlier range of $2.85–$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21%--27% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.05, which is within the guided range.We are upbeat about the company’s innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the second-quarter performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the U.S. and internationally, and portfolio expansion.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on second-quarter 2017 results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

211,TMO,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 4, before market opens. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.On an average, AngioDynamics delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.79% in the trailing four quarters. However, a lackluster price performance over the last year and high debt levels continue to hinder the company. AngioDynamics’ shares have returned a mere 0.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Product Portfolio: AngioDynamics’ wide array of products like AngioVac, BioFlo and NanoKnife enhances market opportunities. Notably, the PV business (peripheral vascular sales) has also built a strong momentum. AngioDynamics has been experiencing growth in other product families like Food Management, Thrombus Management, BioFlo products and NanoKnife disposables in the Oncology section.Solero MTA System to Drive Growth: The company rides on the market’s solid response to Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation (MTA) system, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. The platform is intended to be used for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures. Per management, Solero was the primary driver for the whopping 11% year-over-year increase in the oncology surgery sales last quarter.Robust Fundamental Growth Story: Over the last 4 years, the company’s sales witnessed a CAGR of 0.3%, whereas, earnings per share saw a CAGR of 11.3%. The company expects to benefit from the ongoing market transition toward less invasive interventional procedures in the upcoming years.Unfavorable Estimate Revision Trend: The estimate revision trend for the current quarter has been unfavorable for AngioDynamics. In the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues fell 1.4% year over year to $87.80 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined 12.3% to 17 cents per share on a year-over-year basis.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersHowever, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for AngioDynamics in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 17 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Edwards Lifescience Corp.

212,TMO,"CryoLife, Inc. (CRY  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to buy German-based JOTEC AG. JOTEC — a privately-held maker of technologically advanced endovascular stent grafts and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts focused on aortic repair. The company has been recording revenue CAGR of 17% over the last five years.Under the financial terms of the agreement, CryoLife will pay an aggregate of up to $225 million for the deal, with around $168.75 million in cash and $56.25 million in shares of CryoLife’s common stock issued to JOTEC’s shareholders. The buyout is slated to complete later in 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Through this deal, CryoLife aims at expanding the existing portfolio with products focused on aortic surgery, thereby solidifying its footprint in the fast-growing endovascular surgical market.Per management, this deal will help CryoLife diversify its business by gaining access to the $2-billion global market for stent grafts used in endovascular and open repair of aortic diseases. The market is projected to value around $2.5 billion by 2021. Interestingly, CryoLife aims at delivering consistent, high single-digit revenue growth through this deal.The deal is also in line with the company’s strategy to directly sell by eliminating distributors in Europe while creating cross-selling opportunities for the company’s product portfolios. In the last reported quarter, CryoLife began the process of direct selling in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, expanding direct operations in Europe.At the same time, management expects the newly-added products to continue to post double-digit growth outside the United States for at least the next five years. Moreover, the deal is expected to prove accretive to the company’s non-GAAP EPS at a CAGR of not less than 20% over the next five years, while contributing to gross and operating margin.CryoLife expects to gain access to the $1.2-billion U.S. stent graft market, which is projected to value roughly $1.5 billion by 2021 through the newly gained, highly competitive product portfolio and advanced research and development platform. Thus, the company expects this deal to drive growth through 2018 as well.CryoLife also provided a sneak peek into its preliminary third-quarter results. The company has recorded revenues of $44.0 million. This considers a negative impact of around $1 million from hurricanes, delay in receipt of re-certification of Ascending Aortic Prosthesis, reversal of around $1.1 million of recorded revenues on repurchase of some inventory from third-party distributors in order to sell directly.We believe unhealthy lifestyle, favorable demographics, rising expenditure on healthcare by government and technological developments will continue to drive growth in the aortic aneurysm market. This fact is further substantiated by a Research and Markets report published by Nasdaq. Per the report, the global aortic aneurysm market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 6.6% between 2017 and 2023. Thus, this acquisition deal is expected to boost the top line of CryoLife.Share Price PerformanceOver the last six months, CryoLife has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 35.1%, compared with the broader industry’s 14.4% rise.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCryoLife currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report).

213,TMO,"Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), or LabCorp, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 26.Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 1.37% with an average beat of 0.36% for the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play  The last-reported first quarter 2017 dented LabCorp’s overall top line performance, heavily on dull numbers registered in Covance Drug Development business. This was due to sluggish early development and central lab businesses, affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteRight now, although the company is trying to execute its strategy to focus more on higher-value therapeutic areas such as oncology and CNS (central nervous system) disorders, this procedure is tied to complex studies which will take time to generate revenue. We believe, the Covance Drug Development will continue to remain a drag for LabCorp’s overall business.Earlier, the company noted that from a timing perspective, both Covance Drug Development’s revenue and margins will be down on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2017, before showing favorable growth in the second half of 2017.This apart, unfavorable foreign exchange remains a bother. Previously, the company viewed that it expects an impact of approximately 40 basis points of negative currency on 2017 revenues. Covance Drug Development’s net revenue is estimated to feel the impact of approximately 130 basis points of negative currency while the LabCorp Diagnostics segment will be affected approximately 10 basis points of negative currency in 2017. This should be reflected in the numbers of the quarter yet to be reported.We are also highly disappointed with the CMS proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act.On a positive note, we are upbeat about the company’s ongoing cost-reduction initiatives related to project LaunchPad, which currently has over 100 projects at various stages of implementation. Recently, the company has expanded the LaunchPad initiative to now include Covance Drug Development. This initiative will be a three-year program for Covance that consists of two phases. The company has already initiated the first phase to ‘right-size’ Covance Drug Development’s resources, primarily head count and facility footprint.This phase is projected to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $20 million in 2017 and approximately $45 million on an annualized basis thereafter. The pre-tax cost to achieve these savings is estimated to be approximately $30 million in 2017, of which, around $20 million is presumed to be cash expenditures.This should get reflected in the second-quarter results as well.The company’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should also maintain its momentum in 2017. Notably, within immuno-oncology drug development, it doubled the number of study awards from 2015 to 2016 and also performed a number of PD-L1 tests through Diagnostic and Drug Development segments.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #4 which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Note that we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider, as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

214,TMO,"Quest Diagnostics Inc.'s (DGX  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9% and the year-ago number by 1.5%.Adjusted EPS in the reported quarter excluded charges related to restructuring and integration, retirement of debt, gain on disposition of business as well as amortization expenses. The reported EPS came in at $1.15, a 14.2% slip from the year-ago quarter figure.Reported revenues in the third quarter inched up 2.4% year over year to $1.93 billion. The quarter’s number however remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. According to the company, in spite of weather challenges, the year-over-year improvement came on the back of successful execution of its two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Volume (measured by the number of requisitions) increased 1.6% year over year in the third quarter. Also, revenue per requisition increased 1.2%. Diagnostic information services revenues in the quarter rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.85 billion.Cost of services during the reported quarter was $1.19 billion, up 2.9% year over year. Gross margin came in at 38.4%, reflecting a 25 basis points (bps) contraction year over year.Among the operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.4% to $423 million in the reported quarter. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin showed an contraction of 45 bps to 16.5%.Quest Diagnostics exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $350 million, which marked an 11.5% rise from the preceding quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $852 million, compared with $765 million in the year-ago period.In the third quarter, the company repurchased 0.6 million shares for $65 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Quest Diagnostics was left with $1 billion of authorization under the previous share repurchase plan.OutlookConsidering the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, especially on the company's operations in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, as well as recently closed acquisitions, Quest Diagnostics has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company now expects full-year reported revenues of approximately $7.71 billion (annualized growth of approximately 3%) as compared to the earlier stated range of $7.69 billion to $7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6–3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, lower than the company’s projected number.In addition, the upper-end of the company’s earlier-provided 2017 adjusted EPS range has been reduced. Currently Quest Diagnostics expects earnings for the full year to remain in the band of $5.62–$5.67 from earlier forecast of $5.62–$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.63 falls within but near to the lower-end of the projected band.Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected at around $1.2 billion, unchanged from the previous guidance. The current estimates for capital expenditure are pegged at $250–$300 million (unchanged).Our TakeQuest Diagnostics’ third-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues remained in line with the same. On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment. We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are currently looking forward to the company’s recently-announced strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic which includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab.On the flip side, Quest Diagnostics faced major sales disruption due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, where the company has a significant presence. Also hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the earthquake in Mexico affected Quest Diagnostics’ overall performance in the reported quarter. With this the company has to reduce the upper-end of its earlier provided full-year earnings guidance range, which is disappointing.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). It is currently requesting CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act).Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusting for certain net specified items for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to stay within a band of $2.48-$2.50 (earlier guidance was $2.43-$2.53). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.49, at the midpoint of the projected range.The company has also provided its fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance. It expects to report adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 72 cents to 74 cents for the quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents falls at the midpoint of the projected range.Our TakeOne more time, Abbott has successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. However, these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business.The company continues to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which has started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care.In 2017, the company is effectively executing its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Also, emerging market performance remains extremely promising on several new strategic developments.Abbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report).

217,TMO,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.23%. The trailing four-quarter average beat is pegged at 0.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams globally. The company while gaining share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent). continues to build momentum globally.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of earnings release, we believe the quarter’s IC business to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, last February, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.The above product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This might lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.While we believe the downbeat IC business to earn some boost from the company’s recent $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.Accordingly, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $403 million, significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $367 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266 million remains ahead of the year-ago reported tally of $248 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of $85 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings.Overall, Boston Scientific’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29-31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18-$2.21 billion.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which fails to increase the predictive power of ESP.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% with a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and also carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

218,TMO,"Developer of robotic technology and products Mazor Robotics Ltd (MZOR  -  Free Report), recently announced that it expects to report third-quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $17.2 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago quarter. The bullishness comes from strength in Mazor X system sales and increased procedure volumes.Stock PerformanceLately, the price performance of the Israel-based company has been encouraging. In the last three months, the stock has returned 28.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 3.0%. The stock’s current return was higher than the S&P 500’s return of 4.1% over the same time frame.  Despite the bullish price trend, estimate revision for the stock has been quite disappointing. The full year saw two estimates moving south in the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the estimate contracted to a loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 88 cents during the aforementioned period.Factors Behind Mazor X StrengthDuring the third quarter, the company received purchase orders for 19 Mazor X systems in the United States. In addition, Mazor received purchase orders for three Renaissance systems for the Chinese market.Mazor X is a transformative guidance system for simplifying spine surgeries with advanced features and ""sophisticated integrative abilities."" Strong demand for Mazor X systems during the third quarter reached backlog to 17 since its introduction in the second half of 2016. The company is slated to report financial results for the third quarter ended Sep 30, in November.Bottom LineWe are hopeful about the encouraging global spine surgery market. A research report by Markets And Markets suggests that the niche markets are estimated to reach $17.27 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.3%.In fact, the increasing utilization rate of Mazor X is quite compelling for the company. We believe that the commercialization cycle of the Mazor X platform is progressing per plans with a growing customer base.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Mazor has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report).

220,TMO,"On Sep 14, we issued an updated research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report), a leading scientific instrument maker. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, Thermo Fisher has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 9.6%, higher than the broader market’s gain of 1.9% over that time frame. The company continues to see strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy. The raised 2017 guidance is also encouraging.The company’s acquisition activities to drive growth inorganically also raise hopes. We are particularly upbeat about the company’s foray into the into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space through the recent acquisition of Patheon N.V. for $7.2 billion. Moreover, the takeover of FEI Company has started to contribute to Thermo Fisher’s analytical instruments portfolio. A few of the company’s other strategic purchases are Finesse Solutions and Alfa Aesar.Meanwhile, this Waltham, MA-based company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the company’s recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, Thermo Fisher has a strong cash balance that enables it to adopt attractive share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. Management currently estimates unfavorable foreign exchange to have a negative impact on its top line in 2017.The landscape has become intensely competitive, thanks to changing technology and customer demand that require continual research and development.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

221,TMO,"The third-quarter earnings season has commenced on an encouraging note for most sectors, with releases from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) till October 20.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show in the quarter. For Q3, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate during the second-quarter of 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Medical Products Amid Political UncertaintiesHowever, the Medical Product space, within the broader Medical universe, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump’s repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.However, major MedTech players have been pinning their hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though the elimination of this tax is far from being achieved.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space will likely keenly await earnings reports from MedTech bigwigs like Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., (TMO  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Notably, all the companies are expected to release their earnings results on Oct. 25.For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency (cc). Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. We believe the company’s solid sales in the Medical Products segment will be a key driver in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $1,648 million, up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Baxter International Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?).Despite the solid prospects, our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.34%.

Price and Consensus  Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business, which is estimated to account for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2017.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PetMed Express, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PetMed Express, Inc.

We note that the variation in average order value is mainly driven by a shift of sales to higher priced items.Per the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons while fall and winter represent off-seasons.During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 134,000 new customers, up from 131,000 a year ago.

General and administrative expenses were up 7.5% year over year to $6.2 million. Also, advertising expenses rose 3.3% to $4.5 million. This led to a 5.6% increase in adjusted operating expenses (without depreciation expense), which amounted to $10.7 million. Nevertheless, adjusted operating margin in the quarter rose 610 bps to 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.PetMed exited the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.4 million compared with $68.5 million at the end of the first-quarter fiscal 2017.

223,TMO,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.AmerisourceBergen’s track record has been quite impressive, with the company comfortably beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.51%, bringing the four-quarter average to 7.12%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayAmerisourceBergen’s pharmaceutical distribution segment continues to face headwinds in the form of contract renewals and lower generic inflation. The AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”) business is also being hurt by several factors, including accelerating deflation of generic drugs and lower contribution from generic launches.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation will adversely impact bottom line.However, the company renewed its relationship with the largest health systems customer and has been making persistent efforts to address the headwinds in the ABDC segment. This can boost the top line to some extent in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s estimate revision trend is mixed. For the current quarter, AmerisourceBergen saw one upward and downward estimate movement over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.37.Also, the company is apprehensive about its earnings and revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding drug pricing trends. The company currently expects revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.92.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, on par with the lower end of the company’s updated guided range.In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range has been raised to $5.62–$5.72 from the earlier forecast of $5.45–$5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 is below this range.Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected at around $1.2 billion, above the previous guidance of $1.1 billion. The current estimates for capital expenditure are pegged at $250–$300 million (unchanged).Our TakeQuest Diagnostics’ second-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues lagged the same. On a positive note, the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment. Also, the raised guidance for adjusted earnings, revenues and net cash from operating activities buoy optimism about the company’s performance.We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its new two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services.  In addition, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks were major growth drivers. In this regard, we are looking forward to the company’s deal with Walmart. Particularly, the company is positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to bolster growth in 2017. Also, management is upbeat about its latest acquisitions of Med Fusion and ClearPoint to advance in the diagnostics space.However, over the past several quarters, the overall soft industry trends, leading to a low volume environment, acted as a dampener for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Quest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report).

225,TMO,"Medical instruments manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $2.30 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%. In fact, Thermo Fisher’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystThe acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to this Waltham MA-based company’s analytical instruments portfolio from the last two quarters. The acquisition has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteThermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in third-quarter 2017 performance.Overall, the company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the third quarter, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments operating income is pegged at $233 million, in line with the sequentially last quarter’s reported number. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s third-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the third quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through the last couple of quarters in 2017. A major development in this field is that Novartis’ chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy Kymriah, the first FDA-approved cell therapy for Leukemia, utilizes Thermo Fisher’s CTS Dynabeads Technology.We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also likely to be seen in applied markets such as, environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is currently betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to impose challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher has the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of +0.37%.

226,TMO,"On Oct 16, we issued an updated research report on Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report). This NJ-based company is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company.Over the last six months, Phibro has been trading above the broader  industry. Currently, the stock has gained 35.9% compared with 10.9% of the broader industry.Animal Health was a key contributor, delivering positive growth over the last few quarters. According to Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as improving nutrition to improve health. We believe a diverse portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.  Outside the United States, Phibro has extended its reach to Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. Currently, the company is expanding its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the turmoil in the economies of Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain its performance.On the flip side, Phibro operates in highly competitive industries. With respect to its major products, it faces threat from a substantial number of global and regional players. Furthermore, withdrawal of approval for Mecadox (carbadox) by the FDA is a concern. Additionally, Phibro conducts operations globally, which entails transactions in a variety of currencies. As a result, currency fluctuation is a major issue for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhibro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). Abbott, IDEXX Laboratories and Thermo Fisher carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Abbott has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.7%. The stock rallied roughly 32.7% over the last year.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. The stock gained 40.9% last year.Thermo Fisher has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 11.7%.

227,TMO,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 13.7%, reaching the four-quarter average to 17.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe are encouraged by the company’s guidance for the second quarter of 2017 and full-year 2017. For the second quarter, Baxter estimates sales growth of about 2% at constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 55 cents to 57 cents versus the year-ago figure of 46 cents. Also, for full-year 2017, the company projects earnings in the band of $2.20 to $2.28 per share (from continuing operations, before special items), up from full-year 2016 earnings of $1.95. Of late, Baxter has accelerated its pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations that enhance its product portfolio, thereby opening up significant long-term opportunities. Also, several recent FDA approvals are likely to boost growth in the yet-to-be-reported second quarter of 2017.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteThe company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter saw two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the second quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact the top line by low single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Baxter International is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 51 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Baxter International carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

228,TMO,"The second-quarter earnings season commenced last week and the S&P 500 index had a good start with respect to earnings and revenue growth. Per the latest Earnings Preview, till Jul 21 2017, 97 S&P 500 members (28.1% of the total market cap) have reported their quarterly numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues.This week, 183 S&P 500 members are lined up to report their quarterly results. This time around, we are bullish about the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.What’s in Store for the Medical Space?While overall growth is steadily accelerating from the few preceding quarters’ performances, the investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen to struggle a lot during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.Whether President Donald Trump finally amends its earlier proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) or totally repeals and replaces Obamacare, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about the space.This lack of visibility befuddles the bullish trend the Medical sector (one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors) was maintaining over the past few quarters. Accordingly, for the second quarter, expected earnings growth rate stands at 0.00%, a break-even level on 3.8% revenue growth projection. This compares unfavorably with the first-quarter 2017’s reported earnings growth rate of 5.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of four major Medical - Instruments companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 26.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): This leading cardiovascular product maker is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 26. Edwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve (TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.Edwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are on par at 88 cents. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.(Read More: Edwards Lifesciences Q2 Earnings: A Surprise in Store?)Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteThermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.

The company has already spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too.Thermo Fisher is expected to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +0.44%.That is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.27, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at $2.26.

229,TMO,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 26.87%. It is worth noting that Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.89%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 74 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Align Technology’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.37% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, thereby ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in Feb 2017. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter.In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the Invisalign platform, Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March. Post-collaboration, Align’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteNotably, to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, design and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company had announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to likely continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for second-quarter 2017, the company projects earnings per share of 71−74 cents on revenues of $340–$345 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 221,000 to 224,000, up 25–27% from a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansionOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

231,TMO,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. The stock has rallied 25.2% over the last six months, ahead of the S&P 500’s 8.8% gain and the broader industry’s 12.9% rise.Moreover, this Massachusetts-based medical instruments manufacturer has a market cap of $77.01 billion. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is favorable at 14.3% compared with 9.4% of the industry.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the last 60 days, seven analysts revised their estimates upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased around 1.1% to $9.33 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.The company has been steadily adding capacities and enhancing existing ones through acquisitions. In this regard, the acquisition of FEI, which has already started generating synergies and contributing largely to the company’s analytical instruments portfolio, has in turn boosted market optimism surrounding the stock. Moreover, we are looking forward to the company’s latest Patheon buyout through which Thermo Fisher forayed into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space.Moreover, the company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the company’s recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors. Moreover, we believe the company’s strong cash balance will enable it to carry on with the strategy of inorganic expansion.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. Management currently estimates unfavorable foreign exchange to have a negative impact on its top line in 2017.Also, a tough competitive landscape continues to pose challenges for the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The suit seeks a ban on the use of Agilent’s proprietary technologies and compensation for its losses.The company’s senior vice president and general counsel Michael Tang stated, “Agilent is determined to protect our IP, and will take all appropriate legal actions against any infringements worldwide.”We observe that Agilent shares have rallied 37.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.6%.IP and its Protection MatterIntellectual property (IP) rights and their protection (by law) encourage a company toward better production and commitment to additional resources and enhances consumer confidence against counterfeits. These hold the key to the survival of multibillion dollar firms and give them ways to legally fight competition.This is all the more important for Agilent as it faces fierce competition from the likes of Veeco Instruments (VECO  -  Free Report), Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report).Agilent Technologies, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Agilent Technologies, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteBut the Truth is BitterAt the end of the day, employees do like to switch jobs because it’s more profitable and allows them liberties that aren’t available for sticking around at a big corporate house like Agilent.In the process, IP also changes hand (illegally). There have been instances of employees leaving companies, forming new ones and getting sued over intellectual property infringement in the past and it may happen in the future too.So, while Agilent could win this battle, the war will go on.Agilent has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

233,TMO,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report) has recently obtained the required antitrust clearance related to the earlier-announced purchase of all outstanding ordinary shares of Patheon N.V. . On Aug 7, 2017, competition authorities in Brazil approved of this transaction and initiated a 15-day comment period, which expired on Aug 22, 2017. Additionally, the European Commission sanctioned the takeover on Aug 23.Notably, in May, Thermo Fisher (CN) Luxembourg S.à r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary of the leading scientific instrument maker agreed to acquire Netherlands-based Patheon. The latter is a global provider of high-quality drug solutions to pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors. On completion of the deal, Patheon will become a part of Thermo Fisher’s Laboratory Products and Services segment.Total transaction value was fixed at around $7.2 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.0 billion of net debt. The acquisition is expected to wrap up by the end of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Basically, Patheon offers comprehensive and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies satisfy complex developments and manufacturing needs. It is a leader in the high-growth, $40 billion Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) market. The company with extensive network in North America and Europe had generated revenues of approximately $1.9 billion in 2016.Notably, Thermo Fisher has been doing well for quite some time. For the last three months, the company has been trading above the industry. The stock has inched up 2% as against the industry’s 0.2% decline during the period.Per the latest reported second-quarter 2017, revenues from the Laboratory Products and Services Segment grew 4% year over year. This segment serves laboratory customers with equipment and consumables improving productivity and a range of BioPharma outsourcing services. It also includes the company’s research and safety market customer channels.Thermo Fisher considers Patheon’s purchase as a strategic fit to expand biopharma services in Europe. Per management, the combined entity should significantly strengthen the acquirer’s unique value proposition for pharmaceutical and biotech customers by adding highly complementary services.The consolidation is also expected to prove accretive to Thermo Fisher’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full year post the merger’s completion. Management also expects to realize total synergies of approximately $120 million by the third year following the closure of the deal, which consists of roughly $90 million of cost synergies and $30 million of adjusted operating income benefit from revenue-related synergies.Per a recent MarketsandMarkets report, the global laboratory equipment services market is projected to reach worth $11.51 billion by 2021 from $6.50 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 10.0% during the forecast period. Growth in this market is primarily led by an increasing research in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with the urgent need for timely and effective diagnosis of diseases. We expect Thermo Fisher to cash in on this opportunity in order to gain traction in a potentially strong new market.Zacks Rank & Key PicksThermo Fisher currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

237,TMO,"athenahealth Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company posted earnings of 10 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.On an average, athenahealth beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 12.66% over the last four quarters.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWe believe a strong product portfolio and expanding physician base will continue to drive athenahealth’s top line. Applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne and athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems are fortifying its market position.However, on the flip side, lack of enterprise-sized deals, winding up of government funded stimulus and increasing competition in the Healthcare IT market are major dampeners. For fiscal 2017, the company expects revenues in the band of $1,210–$1,250 million. Adjusted operating income is projected in the range of $120–$140 million. Annual bookings are expected at around $350–$400 million.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether athenahealth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is seven cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 16.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.63%. Also, the company delivered an average beat of 14.44% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Intuitive Surgical prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a key catalyst. Earlier, da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. For the second quarter, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the U.S. The company anticipates full-year 2017 procedure growth within 12% to 14%. Full-year 2017 gross profit margin is expected in the upper end of the range of 69% to 71% of net revenue.Moreover, rising procedural volumes outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, fortifies the company’s market position. In fact, the integrated Table Motion product line has gained significant traction within a short span of time and is likely to boost the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, increased spending on product development and higher investments in expanding the company’s footprint in international markets are prudent moves to drive long-term growth in our view.We note that Intuitive Surgical outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments sub-industry in the last one year.

While earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues remained in line with the same. We are disappointed by the company’s declining sales performance within several of its core segments. The trimemd 2017 guidance also added to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead. Nevertheless, improved gross and operating margin performance was encouraging.We look forward to the expected synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering.

Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29–31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18–$2.21 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 31 cents while for revenues, it is $2.19 billion.Our TakeEven amid challenging economic conditions, a competitive environment and severe currency headwinds, Boston Scientific posted a better-than-expected second quarter, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues, ahead of the mark. While foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recent recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. Also the unimpressive defibrillator performance within the company’s core CRM segment continues to remain a drag for the overall growth.Nevertheless, Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets, which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the second quarter. We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products, both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company’s recent acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, in a bid to fortify its structural heart business in Europe. This apart, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems. It also received CE Mark for the Vercise Gevia Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System and the first MR-conditional directional DBS system for treatment of movement disorder symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, dystonia and essential tremor.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some other better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

241,TMO,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. However, it reported an average beat of 0.36% for two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. Revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link in the last reported quarter. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $411 million reflects an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Moreover, though at the initial phase of integration, the LDR Holdings acquisition is expected to contribute approximately 30 basis points to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the LDR acquisition provides on the back of integrated spine sales force in the United States.Also, continued solid uptake of SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine & CMF revenues of $188 million indicates a rise of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s third-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the company’s flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. In this regard, in September, the company announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System. This is the latest addition to its portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, in June, Zimmer Biomet announced the release of its X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn which affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other parts of the emerging market, especially the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $379 million indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, Zimmer Biomet expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.815-$1.845 billion, reflecting a negative impact from foreign exchange of 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion.However, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been adversely denting Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has also been dealing with pricing pressure issue. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.6% in the second-quarter. Thus, in absence of any favorable changes in this line, the company may continue to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for the second half of 2017, management continues to expect the adverse impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending in critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from Warsaw North Campus facility to persist.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Zimmer Biomet does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zimmer Biomet is -0.38%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 reflects a 2.2% decline on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Thermo Fisheris seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TMO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.25 per share for TMO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TMO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.19% heading into earnings season.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TMO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Thermo Fisher, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

243,TMO,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% as the Most Accurate estimate is 91 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 90 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #3 and +1.23% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayHenry Schein’s second-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas. We expect a similar trend in the third quarter as well.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations to witness at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues of $3.049 billion reflects an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Beginning Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to some extent.Notably, during the second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighborhood. This has helped the company operate as a complete solution provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margins over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $7.17-$7.30, reflecting 8-10% growth from the 2016 EPS figure of $6.61.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

244,TMO,"Penumbra, Inc. (PEN  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 11. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CatalystsOver the past few quarters, Penumbra showcased strong top-line performance on consistent growth in its neuro and peripheral vascular arms. The company is presently focusing on driving innovation, product development and geographic expansion. This is expected to help Penumbra maintain the bullish growth trend in the to-be-reported quarter.It is to be noted that neuro growth was mainly driven by sales of the Penumbra system for ischemic stroke. The company witnessed increased sequential growth on higher procedural volumes. However, the company expects to see seasonality in the neuro business in the third quarter.Also, peripheral vascular growth was driven by the Indigo family and peripheral thrombectomy along with the Coil portfolio in peripheral embolization.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for neuro revenues of $54 million reflects an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago-quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for peripheral vascular revenues of $24.6 million shows a rise of 25.2% from the year-earlier quarter.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. Quote Overall, fiscal third-quarter total revenues are projected at $79 million, up 17.9% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Penumbra’s third-quarter results:Penumbra has been delivering strong performance in both domestic and international markets on the back of solid contributions from its neuro business. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.In second-quarter 2017, gross margin deteriorated and operating expenses increased. According to the company, increased compensation expenses related to growth in headcount and higher clinical trial expenses resulted in operating loss in the quarter. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the third quarter.Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 29.2% in the second quarter. With the company remaining focused on product launches, we expect expenses to remain high in the third quarter.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Overall, the company expects revenues to decline sequentially in the third quarter owing to seasonality in summer. The company expects to report revenues in the band of $312-$317 million.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Penumbra has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

245,TMO,"We expect IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, at an average of 9.3%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The growth in CAG Diagnostics was led by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.We are upbeat about the 300% year-over-year rise in the uptake of SNAP Pro units in North America last quarter. Management expects the solid performance to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $426 million reflects an increase of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXX’s third-quarter results:IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX expects its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) business to witness flat-to-modest growth in the second half of 2017. The segment has been seeing continued strength in China. Also, expansion of the recurring pregnancy testing franchise buoys optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the LPD business of $30.3 million for the third quarter reflects an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal market of emerging nations. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the company’s third-quarter performance.Encouraged by these factors, IDEXX expects 2017 revenue in the range of $1,945-$1,965 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 10% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter total revenues are projected at $494 million, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarterManagement also estimates its 2017 EPS guidance to the band of $3.12-$3.22 per share, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents EPS growth of 28-32% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.17 reflects an increase of 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, management is upbeat about the 12% rise in the sales force in the U.S. market and some other areas in the third quarter.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern for the company is its high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward portfolio development and geographic expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on third-quarter 2017 results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is 0.00%.

246,TMO,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.44%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 16.71%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% as the Most Accurate estimate is 85 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Price and EPS Surprise   Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s strategic initiatives like international expansion, ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. Also, we are upbeat about the international teen case growing 40.5% year over year in the last reported quarter, reflecting growing demand. In the quarter, the company reached a new benchmark of 1 million teen patients who had adopted the Invisalign treatment.Management anticipates consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In a bid to grow in this region, the company opened new Invisalign Treatment Planning Facility in China.We are upbeat about management’s expectations of continued strong performance in international markets in the to-be-reported quarter. Invisalign volumes are likely to grow sequentially, reflecting continued strong growth in APAC. However, summer holidays in EMEA may partially mar the performance.Notably, to expand its Invisalign brand, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment.Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners.  In this context, Align Technology recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report). Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. This latest development should boost the iTero scanner customer base starting from the third quarter itself.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for the third quarter of 2017, the company projects EPS of 78-81 cents on revenues of $355-$360 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 231,000 to 234,000, up 27-29% over the same period a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration through geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

In fact, Thermo Fisher's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?  Our proven model shows that Thermo Fisher is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.44%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Thermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  The combination of Thermo Fisher’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat this time around. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings? The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the first quarter.The company has already spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too. Some recently introduced noteworthy products include its new iCAP triple-quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms); cloud-based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the laboratories (within laboratory products); CarrierScan Assay, a microarray-based solution detecting over 6,000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases (within Genetic Sciences).It also introduced new targeted assays for cancer research that run on Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing instruments; new tests for autoimmune disease and drugs of abuse; and new Clariom Pico assays for more effective biomarker discovery. Notably last month, the US FDA had granted a premarket approval for the company’s Oncomine Dx Target Test. We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum throughout the rest of 2017.Growth is likely to be seen in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. This apart, the company is currently betting on some key-focus areas with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicine from mass spectrometry to targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. The acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to the company’s analytical instruments portfolio from last quarter. It is also the highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal closure, with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in second-quarter 2017 performance.However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind to the tune of $250 million on 2017 revenues (an impact of 1.5%) and 17 cents on adjusted EPS (around 2%). Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on Thermo Fisher’s stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to pose a threat to the stock’s value.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Dextera Surgical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

249,TMO,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate remarkably by 11.63%. Also, the company posted an average beat of 4.67% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s sneak a peek how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAbbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, delivering encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including the sale of Abbott’s developed market businesses along with the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. However, the absence of any substantial advancement in this division in the recent past has compelled the company to maintain low expectations at high single-digit growth in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteOn a positive note, with a strong market position in several geographies, including China, Latin America and several markets in Southeast Asia, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.Abbott initiated the implementation of its operational model within the EPD space in the first quarter, as planned. Per the model, the company will focus on selling its highly diversified line of products in core therapeutic areas to treat local health conditions. This in turn will allow the company to widen its customer base by creating unique relationship with physicians, retailers and pharmacies. Also, Abbott plans to strengthen its developmental capabilities by expanding its EPD innovation center in India.There have been a slew of developments within medical device as well. The market is upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System prospects post the receipt of full or partial reimbursement by the French Health Ministry in May 2017.At this platform, the company also announced Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in Jun 2017.Notably, all these developments are expected to drive the company’s traction in the Diabetes Care segment, which saw sales growth of 20.2% in the last reported quarter on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.This apart, the market is bullish on Abbott’s Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor after it received CE Mark in May 2017.  Post-approval, the product has seen strong consumer acceptance with implants taking place in 10 countries across Europe. In May 2017, the company announced CE Mark for its Tacticath Contact Force Ablation Catheter which is another key positive.Continuing with its trend of extensive research and new product developmet, the company, launched two science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries – Ensure Surgery Immunonutrition Shake and EnsurePre- Surgery Clear Nutrition Drink – in Apr 2017.We are also bullish about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical on Jan 4. The comprehensive combined portfolio is quite promising..Notably, Abbott projects annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 59 cents to 61 cents. Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in low to mid-single digits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Abbott is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP for Abbott is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

252,TMO,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, this San Diego, CA-based company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 17.4% in this period, higher than the broader industry’s 7.9% gain.Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered promising top-line performances primarily banking on strong product launches. The latest in the list includes the launch of VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe. Also overall strong uptake in NovaSeq is encouraging. Moreover, the rate of NIPT adoption is rising outside the United States.  We are also upbeat about Illumina’s partnership with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent company Verogen, Inc. The independent company is expected to boost Illumina’s next-generation sequencing (NGS) business in the forensic genomics market.

The stock has improved 7% compared with the broader industry's 4.7% gain during the period.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the company’s acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify the European structural heart business. We are also encouraged by the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic as well as overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the company’s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments. The company particularly plans to launch products into high-growth adjacent markets with a strong potential to reap an incremental $13 billion in market opportunity by 2020.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWhile adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the company’s top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points.Also, a dull defibrillator sale within its core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of a challenging economy and a competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.However, given the company’s bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on.

254,TMO,"As a major setback to the company’s investors, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)  recently foresees a significant impact of Hurricane Maria on second-quarter fiscal 2018 sales. Having acquired a category 5 status, Hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, thus hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Adding to the woes, the company has a level of manufacturing setup for all its four business groups — viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (''CVG''), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (''MITG''), Restorative Therapies Group (''RTG'') and Diabetes Group — in Puerto Rico. While the facilities are gradually getting operative since Oct 2, the sites are only partially active at present on power supply from back-up generators.With considerable repairing done, the company expects the normal manufacturing process to get fully restored in the coming weeks.Financial ImpactsMedtronic has provided a statement on the company’s financial health badly hurt by  Maria and further affecting the overall business. Notably, in line with business continuity protocols, the company is utilizing the existing inventory levels and increasing manufacturing processes in locations outside Puerto Rico for multiple products.Medtronic projects both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted net earnings to show the impact to the extent of $250 million. More specifically, the MITG and the RTG groups are expected to be worst hit. Notably, this quarter will close on Oct 27, 2017.Significantly, the company forecasts some non-recurring expenses, directly related to recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which will be excluded from adjusted earnings. However, expenses related to the effects outside Puerto Rico will be considered operating expenses.Incidentally, Medtronic is lacks enough visibility about the impact of Maria, post the second quarter. However, forecasting a strong new product demand, particularly in the CVG and Diabetes Group, the company continues to expect mid-single digit revenue growth (on a comparable, constant currency basis) in the second half of fiscal 2018.Despite the Maria-related impact, the company reaffirmed the fiscal second quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidances.Among the company’s many supports toward disaster management, the Medtronic Foundation has directed $1 million for disaster relief to date and is matching employee contributions to authorized agencies.Price Performance Over the last three months, Medtronic has been observed to underperform the broader industry.  The stock has declined 8.5% versus the broader industry’s  4.7% gain during this period. Sad but true, this gloomy scenario is likely to continue per the company’s latest financial prediction due to Maria.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V.

258,TMO,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.Last quarter, this renowned healthcare products and service distributor delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.0%. Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHenry Schein’s first-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas markets. We expect a similar trend in the second quarter as well.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteNotably, during the to-be-reported second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighbourhood. This has enabled the company to be a complete solutions provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. In this regard, we note that management expects at least mid-single digit growth in North America’s dental equipment market in the second quarter. The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is thus busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s year-over-year deterioration in gross and operating margin over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Meanwhile, per management, solid sales in the second quarter are likely to be partially offset by the timing of Good Friday this year. Notably, this international holiday has fallen in the second quarter this year as compared to last year’s timing which was in the first quarter.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to our woes. Also, advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. adds to the competitiveness in the market.Overall, the company’s reaffirmed its 2017 EPS guidance, reflecting growth of 16–18% from the year-ago period.For the second quarter of 2017, there has been no change in estimate revision over the last 30 days. The same has been observed in the magnitude of estimate revision, with earnings estimates remaining at $1.73 over the same time frame.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Henry Schein this quarter.

260,TMO,"While rising yields have somewhat dulled the appeal for dividend investing, stocks that consistently pay higher dividends are still in vogue.    Dividend Growth in FocusStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 25 stocks that fit the bill:Owens Corning Inc. (OC  -  Free Report): This Ohio-based company is a world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. The stock delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.17% in the past four quarters.

261,TMO,"Denver, CO-based DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), a leading provider of dialysis services to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 79 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents. Over the last four quarters, the company witnessed an average earnings beat of 2.04%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Factors at PlayDavita’s Kidney Care business is expected to perform well in the quarter under review due to its continuous investments in capital-efficient technologies. Steady overseas expansion through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting DaVita’s growth. We believe that DaVita’s constant efforts to upgrade its quality of services, global expansion and active acquisitions are key positives.Operating cash flow is expected to remain strong in the quarter due to improved performance of the Kidney Care business and the capitated care business. Overall management projected DaVita’s operating income for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.6–$1.8 billion. Of this, the company expects operating income of $1.5–$1.6 billion for Kidney Care business. Operating cash flow projection for fiscal 2017 is expected at $1.8–$2.0 billion.On the flipside, escalating expenses are a concern. Management expects significant decrease in operational income, especially in the pharmacy business, for fiscal 2017. DaVita expects a hike in its dialysis and related lab services in the quarter, indicating probabilities of an increase in its general and administrative expenses. The company’s plans to improve its information technology infrastructure and support certain regulatory compliance and legal matters are likely to drive expenses in the quarter.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Coming to estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings has been stable at 90 cents per share over the last two months.DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

262,TMO,"On Sep 14, the U.S. market’s broadest benchmark homed in on the crucial 2,500 mark during a relatively quiet session of trading. This was the second successive record close for the S&P 500, a feat matched by the two other primary gauges of market performance. Of course, underneath the cautious optimism, wariness about a near-term pullback continued to linger. However, analysts at independent broker LPL Financial believe that after a five-month streak of wins, the S&P 500 is on track to mop up further profits this month. Further, the index has nearly always gained in the one-year period immediately following this winning streak. This makes it imperative to pick up S&P 500 stocks, which have mopped up strong gains during this period.Third Strongest Bull Run for S&P 500The S&P 500 gained 0.1% on Sep 13, ending at 2,498.37, only marginally short of the 2,500 mark. Since March 2009, the index has gained a stunning 269%, eclipsing the 266% increase recorded during the Bull Run extending from 1949 to 1956. This increase makes the current Bull Run the third strongest ever recorded. These insights were revealed by data from Bloomberg and the S&P 500 Dow Jones Indices.Although the extent of these increases could raise selloff fears among investors, such alarm is unwarranted. But this is because this stretch of gains loses its luster when considering annualized returns. This measure comes in at only 17%, the fourth poorest when considering 13 such periods. The reason for such a dismal showing is not difficult to discover, of course. At eight and a half years, this is the second longest Bull Run of all time.Five-Month Stretch of Gains to Power Future IncreasesBut for March, when it lost 0.04%, the S&P 500 has now gained for five straight months in a row. In fact, the index has now gained for nine months out of the last 10. Taking total returns into account, which includes the impact of dividends, the index has increased every single month since October 2016.Even as a large swathe of investors worry about pricey valuations, this long streak of gains should serve to ease their fears. Analysts at LPL Financial have stated that such five month stretches of gains are usually followed by year over year increases nearly 96% of the time. The average increase recorded over this period stands at 13.2%. The S&P 500 had gained for five successive months during the period stretching from March to July last year. Between July 2016 and 2017, the index gained 13.7%.Considering a shorter time frame, the S&P 500 also increases over the month following such a winning streak, opines LPL Financial. Per the company’s data such gains have occurred 20 out of 25 times in the past. During the month immediately after a five-month winning stretch, the index has increased by an average level of 1.3%. Incidentally, the S&P 500 has already gained 1.1% till now this month.       Our ChoicesWith the S&P 500 lingering near the 2,500 mark, market naysayers are already raising the specter of a pullback. However, long term trends show that a five month winning streak is usually followed by strong year-over-year gains.Further, such a stretch of increases usually leads to gains in the month immediately following such a period. Picking S&P 500 stocks which have notched up strong gains during this period makes for a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is a premier jet aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest defense contractors in the United States.Boeing has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

264,TMO,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 89 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, adjusted earnings declined 18.3% on a year-over-year basis.Factors at PlayWe are particularly upbeat about Varian’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in second-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 92 cents–96 cents and revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.Further, strengthening its foothold in the oncology business, the company launched its FDA approved product Halcyon in May. Also, in June, the company signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam.We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteThis apart, Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which shows that it is aware of the opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 94 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Thermo Fisher's initial tender offer for Patheon expires after closing of the deal at $35.00 per share in cash.Patheon generated approximately $1.9 billion revenues in fiscal 2016.

In genetic analysis, Affymetrix’s technologies should perfectly complement Thermo Fisher’s products in targeted clinical and applied markets.We also take into consideration the other strategic purchases by Thermo Fisher like that of Finesse Solutions, Alfa Aesar, Advanced Scientifics, One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls.Over the past three months, Thermo Fisher has been trading above the broader industry.
