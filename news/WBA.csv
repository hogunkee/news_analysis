3,WBA,"Just when health care investors thought it was safe to dive back into retail pharmacy stocks, Amazon.com (AMZN) delivered a jolt on Thursday by buying PillPack, an online pharmacy that delivers prescriptions presorted by the dose. The move sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbling. Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) also retreated, along with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX).In April, Walmart (WMT) had reportedly been close to a deal to buy PillPack, nudging aside Amazon. Meanwhile, Amazon's feared shake-up of health care no longer looked quite so scary as the company shelved plans to deliver medical supplies.Now there will again be a focus on just how big of a threat Amazon represents to the prescription retail industry. Already, CVS has moved to same-day delivery in major markets and next-day delivery. CVS Health and Walgreens, which was just added to the Dow Jones, are both developing new drugstore models to deliver a broader array of medical services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

4,WBA,"The Nasdaq composite led the upside in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and wiping away the prior day's 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good. It means that a strong shakeout of weak holders has occurred.The Nasdaq got as high as 7794, good for a new all-time high.

Shares are now up nearly 8%.Homebuilder, coal, diversified operations, fertilizer and soap stocks, however, fell 0.6% or more and weighed on the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost nearly 1.2% on Tuesday, traded virtually flat. The popular 30-stock average is trying to cling to its key 50-day moving average.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is replacing General Electric (GE) in the Dow Jones industrials, is nowhere near a potential breakout to new highs. The stock jumped more than 5% to 67.74 in heavy trade but is more than 19% below 52-week highs. Walgreens also trades beneath its downward-sloping 200-day moving average, a sign of underperformance.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the next-generation payment provider sports a strong Composite Rating of 97 on a scale of 1 to 99. This means that in terms of fundamentals, stock price strength and depth of fund sponsorship, PayPal is superior to 97% of all companies in IBD's database.Walgreens, in contrast, holds a lowly 38 Composite. Shares also trade more than 30% below an August 2015 all-time high of 97.30. Watch to see if Walgreens' ratings improve over time.One thing going for the Deerfield, Ill., company: steady profit gains.Earnings per share have risen 7%, 4%, 13%, 22%, 16% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.

The Nasdaq Composite traded down less than 0.1%.The S&P 500 edged up 0.1%, as earnings-driven gains from McCormick (MKC) and Accenture (ACN) countered the heavy losses from Walgreens, CVS, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and McKesson (MCK).The Commerce Department revised its first-quarter GDP estimates lower, to 2% growth. That was below consensus projections for growth to hold steady at 2.2%. The GDP Price Index, a key inflation gauge, rose to 2.2%. That was well above expectations, also for a no-change reading at 1.9%. The consumer spending estimate was unchanged at 1% growth, in line with expectations.The upshot: growth was slower than expected during the quarter, while inflation rose faster than forecast.  That complicates the pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has signaled that two more interest rate hikes are likely before the end of the year, but is already wrestling with its impact on the finance and stock markets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

9,WBA,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half.

Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%.

Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though.

10,WBA,"In just four months, Amazon (AMZN) has gone from being the biggest threat to health care industry profits to an underdog.XBack in January, when Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) unveiled their new partnership to tame medical costs, the news bulldozed health care stocks.Barely four months later, the trio of companies have found a CEO to lead their venture and plan an announcement within weeks, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Thursday.Yet the emerging reality looks a lot less scary than the original idea to health care investors, if Thursday's market action is any indication.For example, UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer slid more than 4% on that original Jan. 30 announcement, while Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled about 5%.But both stocks were higher on Thursday, with Walgreens gaining 0.7% and UnitedHealth edging up 0.1%, close to its all-time high hit the day before the big Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEven though Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Buffet and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted at the time, ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" and said they were in their early planning stages, investors panicked.The only plausible explanation for such an overreaction was that Amazon had reportedly been gearing up for months to take on the retail drug industry, while challenging drug distributors and kicking the middleman — pharmacy benefit managers — to the curb.Yet four months later, Amazon's health care ambitions look a whole lot less earth-shattering and unlikely to diminish health care industry profitability for years to come.In April, CNBC reported that Amazon had dropped plans to become a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs due to the cost and complexity. Investors seemed to interpret that retreat as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business.Bezos is clearly comfortable in the underdog role and can't be counted out. But a whole host of big industry players and technology companies have a huge head start.

It hit an all-time high on an intraday basis. The Nasdaq 100 rose by the same amount, helped by strength in 21st Century Fox (FOX).

Disney shares lost early gains to trade fractionally lower at 106.03.The S&P 500 edged higher by 0.4%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged was mostly flat.

Shares of Walgreens jumped nearly 5%.In stock market results today, Starbucks (SBUX) took a hit, falling 8.5%, after the company forecast sluggish sales and announced plans to close more than 100 stores.Inside the IBD 50, biotech Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) outperformed, rising 3% to 57.05. It's working on a flat base with a 59.15 entry.RV makers outperformed thanks to a decent earnings report from Winnebago Industries (WGO) late Tuesday. Winnebago gapped up bullishly above the 200-day moving average. Shares were up more than 10%, but at 21% off its high Winnebago could face overhead supply as it tries to work its way higher.

12,WBA,"General Electric (GE) reached a deal to lop off another chunk of its sprawling business on its last day as a component of the Dow Jones industrial average.XThe industrial conglomerate will sell its industrial gas engines unit for $3.25 billion to private equity firm Advent International, which reportedly edged out Cummins (CMI) to land the attractive business worth more than $1 billion in annual revenue.The distributed power unit, whose sale GE announced Monday, makes Jenbacher and Waukesha engines. The heavy-duty gas turbines generate power and heat for industrial facilities, often located in harsh and remote environments.GE CEO John Flannery last year revealed plans to shed $20 billion in assets and slash billions in costs. Last month, he took the biggest step so far in his turnaround plan for the troubled conglomerate, merging GE's century-old railroad business with Wabtec (WAB) in a complex deal worth $11 billion.The industrial gas engines unit, which posted sales of $1.32 billion in 2017, attracted the interest of various buyout firms besides Cummins, according to reports. Cummins makes engines and generators.Shares lost 2.3% at 12.75 on the stock market today, as the Dow Jones industrial average sold off amid an escalating Trump trade war. Wabtech fell 2% and Cummins lost 1.3%, hitting a 52-week low. GE's former Dow peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, on Monday.GE was booted from the Dow Jones industrial average last week and is poised to be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on Tuesday.S&P Dow Jones Indices, which helps determine which stocks are in the Dow Jones industrial average, explained last week why it made the switch.Meanwhile, GE's stock has collapsed by more than 50% in the last year and a half.The distributed-power transaction affects roughly 3,000 employees in Austria, Canada and the U.S.It's part of GE's core power unit, which produces a third of the world's electricity but has been battered by a downturn in demand for power-plant equipment.RBC Capital Markets said the deal should not involve any significant dis-synergies, since distributed power operates mostly as a stand-alone business within GE Power.""In terms of the stock reaction, we do not believe that this $3.25 billion deal is a major needle-mover, as it represents just the latest small asset sale from GE's ongoing portfolio streamlining initiative,"" said RBC analyst Deane Dray. ""But the announcement checks the box on another divestiture/simplification action.""The gas-engines transaction is set to close by the fourth quarter, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

15,WBA,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

The Nasdaq was just below recent highs and the S&P 500 was eyeing the 2,800 mark.(For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Currencies were central to Wednesday's early action across global markets, after the People's Central Bank of China hoisted its reference rate above the high end of economist expectations. The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide.

London's FTSE defended a 1% gain in afternoon trade. Miner Glencore and home grocery delivery leader Ocado topped the FTSE 100.

Both pullbacks could be positive for investors looking for entry points into these China-based tech IPOs.21st Century Fox vaulted 6.6% higher after Disney agreed to raise its bid for company assets to 38 per share, up from 28. That lifted the total value of 50% cash/50% stock deal to $71.8 billion. Fox agreed to the deal, which would give Fox shareholders 19% of Disney ownership following the transaction.  Fox shares ended Tuesday 15% above a flat base buy point at 38.66. Disney shares were up 0.7% in early action. The stock is mired in a 13-month consolidation.Comcast (CMSA), who's earlier bid was topped by Disney's new offer, rose 0.7% in early trade.Winnebago hitched up an 10% opening gain, after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter.

Oracle dropped 4.1% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results.Netflix powered up 1.4% at the start of trade.

That would place it in a profit-taking zone.Facebook opened 1.6% higher.

Annual wage growth came in at 2.7%, less than expected.The U.S led in ratcheting up tariffs early Friday across an increased range of goods imported from China. But four to six weeks of previous declines across global stock, commodities and currency markets had largely priced in the impact of the China tariffs, launched by the U.S. at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The tariffs aim to twist China's arm as the U.S. attempts to restructure its trade relationship with the country.  President Donald Trump told reporters late Thursday that the U.S. would begin with tariffs on $34 billion in China-made goods imported to the U.S. tariffs on another $16 billion in goods were set to launch in two weeks, he said, with potential for as much as $500 billion more.

33,WBA,"Welcome to the Dow Jones industrial average. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest stock on the blue-chip index, is the worst Dow Jones stock in the first half of 2018.General Electric (GE), which tanked 22% through June 30, is no longer a Dow Jones stock. That leaves Walgreens stock leading Dow laggards, followed by 3M (MMM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Caterpillar (CAT) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Each booked a double-digit loss through June. The Dow Jones index overall fell 1.8% over the same period, lagging a 1.7% advance for the S&P 500 index and an 8.8% gain for the Nasdaq composite.On a brighter note, the best-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2018 so far boast impressive gains.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe retail pharmacist took the Dow Jones seat that the embattled GE vacated Tuesday, but faces deep problems of its own.""Walgreens has struggled to cope with a rapidly changing pharmaceutical market with pressured reimbursement, massive consolidation, and increasing competition for prescription volume,"" according to Morningstar.Walgreens Boots Alliance faces increasing and direct competition from grocery chains and retailers. On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) agreed to buy PillPack, making a decisive, long-rumored move into the pharmacy space.Walgreens, which reportedly sought the online pharmacy for itself, tumbled on the news, along with other drug stores and other pharmacy-related stocks.Walgreens stock peaked in January, then sank after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) struck a healthcare partnership. The move potentially threatens Walgreens, which also manages prescription-drug plans and provides health care to store customers.But the pharmacy chain now counts on roughly 10,000 stores — after acquiring thousands of Rite-Aid (RAD) locations — to return to earnings growth.Shares of Walgreens dived 17.4% in the first six months of 2018.Industrial conglomerate 3M must reckon with a continued shift away from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, analysts say.That macroeconomic trend coincided with a severe downturn in its key power market. The company may now sell its gas-turbines unit, after earlier shedding rail, wind and health assets.3M stock sank April 24 after the company lowered its 2018 earnings guidance. It has yet to recover, sitting 26% below a January high of 259.77.Talk of trade wars and steel tariffs also contributed to the decline. Roughly 60% of 3M's revenue comes from abroad.But the company, well regarded for its R&D expertise, continues to scout for growth. It capitalized on automakers' quest to build profitable electric cars by announcing in June that it will invest in a battery factory.Shares tumbled 16.4% in the first half of this year.A household name, P&G's tepid top-line growth has come amid massive shifts in the consumer goods sector.Consumers increasingly choose niche, alternative brands over well-known names, while groceries and supermarkets have shifted from branded products toward more upscale, private labels. The Amazon-Whole Foods deal is set to further disrupt grocery aisles.This multinational also faces intense competition from local companies in emerging markets.However, P&G scored a victory in a recent proxy fight with Trian Fund Management. The Nelson Peltz fund wanted this Dow giant to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy products.P&G shares dropped 15% in the first half of 2018.Caterpillar's woes just grew beyond volatile commodity prices, an uncertain outlook for global infrastructure and construction spending — and loose-lipped execs.It's among companies that face potentially higher negative impact from a Trump trade war that is expanding in scope and reach, research firm CFRA said last week.Caterpillar, a top construction and equipment maker, operates around the globe. China's crackdown on emissions is a potential headwind, but there are other risks.""As urbanization slows or Chinese central planners decide to de-emphasize construction, Caterpillar's resources business could suffer,"" analysts at Morningstar say. But they add restructuring efforts are starting to pay off and heavy equipment demand is starting to recover.Caterpillar stock tanked 6% April 24 after its CFO described Q1 operating margins as a ""high watermark"" for the year. The company later tried to walk back those remarks, but the damage was done.Caterpillar stock lost 13.9% in the first half of this year, with losses accelerating in the last few weeks.The investment banking giant saw trading activity roar back to life in the first quarter, helped by market volatility. But Goldman Sachs stock skidded in March after reports of CEO Lloyd Blankfein's looming departure. Losses accelerated in April after management shared plans to put share buybacks on hold.Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve let most U.S. banking giants announce big stock buybacks and dividend hikes after passing the second round of stress tests. But Goldman and investment bank peer Morgan Stanley (MS) will have to keep shareholder payouts around current levels due to a capital shortfall.Bank stocks, in general, have suffered recently from a flattening yield curve and ebbing consumer confidence. Their 2017 rally, fueled by tax overhaul and rising rates, seems a distant memory now.In May, Goldman Sachs analysts said Amazon (AMZN) has an ""opportunity to expand in financial services,"" but is unlikely to launch a standalone bank.This Dow Jones stock sank 13.4%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Futures Rise With These 2 Tech Titans In Buy ZoneStock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What Can You Expect?If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average And What Does It Measure?

35,WBA,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

36,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue Wednesday as drugstore rivals CVS Health (CVS) and Rite Aid (RAD) are in the midst of big mergers as part of a wave of health care consolidations. Walgreens also raised full-year guidance.Walgreens earned $1.73 a share, up 27% vs. a year earlier. Revenue grew 12.1% to $33.02 billion. Analysts had expected the drugstore chain to earn $1.55 on sales of $31.993 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.

CVS Health is the No. 2 drugstore operator but also a leading pharmacy benefit manager.Walgreens reportedly had been trying to take over drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC), but talks have stalled for now. Walgreens already owns 26% of AmerisourceBergen.Meanwhile, prescriptions have grown for Walgreens in the U.S., and the company in December said it would take a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China, an investment intended to expand its international reach.Consolidation has swept across the health care industry in recent years, spurred partly by the Affordable Care Act, as well as by the Amazon (AMZN) pact with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to lower health care costs for employees.Cigna (CI) recently agreed to buy pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).The threat of Amazon's entry also has helped spur more pressure to gain size and scope.Along with CVS, Walgreens also faces competition from big retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Cigna Will Buy Express Scripts For $67 Billion In Latest Sweeping Health Care DealStocks With Rising Relative Price Strength: HumanaDrug Distributors Sink On Pricing, Opioid Lawsuit Concerns

38,WBA,"Amazon (AMZN) has shelved plans to become a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs due to the cost and complexity, CNBC reported.The news lit a fire under shares of beaten-down drug retailers and distributors. CVS Health (CVS) shot up 4.2% and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) jumped 3.8% on the stock market today. Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

39,WBA,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

40,WBA,"The stock market is in a correction, but a pocket of retail industry strength can be found in apparel and youth-focused retail companies Lululemon (LULU), Five Below (FIVE), Urban Outfitters (URBN), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) – as tech stocks like Amazon (AMZN) seem to have fallen out of favor.With the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite still well off their highs, it's not the time to be aggressively buying stocks. Instead, add high-quality stocks that are holding above their 50-day lines and have strong relative strength lines to your watch list. Many retail stocks have been making a comeback and could potentially warrant consideration for your portfolio when market conditions improve.Lululemon earns a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Five Below has a 97. American Eagle Outfitters has a 91, and Urban Outfitters and Abercrombie & Fitch have Composite Ratings of 90. The Composite Rating scores a stock on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance vs. the S&P 500.Lululemon hit a new all-time high Monday morning, but then reversed down 2.1% to 87.27. Shares had surged after a post-earnings gap-up on Wednesday. Given the stock market sell-off, the relative strength line still set new high ground, which is bullish. The RS measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. The higher the line, the greater the stock's outperformance.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Lululemon's e-commerce sales accelerated 42% in the most recent quarter.Teen discount retailer Five Below, whose stock has risen along with the fidget-spinner craze, also has a relative strength line that's hitting new high ground. Shares shot up 3.6% to 73.34 on Thursday, finally closing above a 71.69 buy point. The stock nearly topped its all-time high of 73.55 reached in early January.Five Below hit a record 73.86 early Monday, but reversed to 1.5%.Urban Outfitters remains within buy range from a flat base with a 36.20 buy point, which the retailer first cleared on Feb. 15. Urban Outfitters has been hovering in and out of the buy zone, but found support along the way. The RS line is not at a new high, but it's not too far off of one.Urban Outfitters fell 0.1% to 36.91 on Monday.American Eagle Outfitters is just extended from the 5% buy zone from a double-bottom buy point of 18.92. Shares suffered a big decline in heavy volume amid earnings earlier in March, but quickly rebounded after finding support at the 50-day line. American Eagle closed down 0.9% on Monday, but the RS line set a new high.And Abercrombie & Fitch has a relative strength line that's continuing higher. Shares have been on a nice run, sparked by an earnings-fueled pop in November. Since then, Abercrombie & Fitch has had several pullbacks to the 50-day line, finding support at that technical level each time. Abercrombie lost 1.8% on Monday, outperformaing the market.Up until the latter part of 2017, the overall retail industry was struggling to find its footing amid Amazon's continued dominance. But the renewed strength in select retail names highlights the importance of keeping an eye on sector rotation, especially as many tech stocks have now fallen out of favor.Other retailers and apparel makers are faring well outside of the names listed above. But it's important to note that weakness still remains in the retail industry, with notable laggards being Walmart (WMT) and Walgreens (WBA).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Play Retail Stocks Amid Disruption From AmazonHere's What Investors Should Do In A Market CorrectionAdobe's Top Retail Predictions For 2018

41,WBA,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), seeking to curb opioid abuse, will offer its pharmacy customers a product that disposes of unwanted or expired prescription drugs.X Customers filling a new Class II opioid prescription at any of Wal-Mart's 4,700 U.S. pharmacies will now receive a packet of DisposeRx, a powder that — when mixed into a pill bottle with warm water — creates a safe, biodegradable gel, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Those with refillable opioid prescriptions will get a free sachet every six months, and customers can request a free packet at any time.The move comes as the U.S. grapples with the scourge of opioid addiction, an affliction that often begins when chronic-pain sufferers fill a prescription at a retail pharmacy chain like Wal-Mart, CVS Health (CVS) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). More than two out of three people misusing prescription opioids get them from family and friends, according to federal data. Opioid overdose deaths rose 28% in 2016, to 42,000 men, women and children.Wal-Mart touted the DisposeRx offering as the ""first of its kind"" because it allows patients to dispose of unwanted or expired pills at home. CVS and Walgreens currently offer medication-disposal kiosks at hundreds of locations, a service that Wal-Mart doesn't provide. Wal-Mart does sells a drug-deactivation product called Deterra, which is made by Verde Technologies.""The best part is that patients don't have to take the drugs back to a location,"" Marybeth Hays, Wal-Mart's head of consumables and health and wellness in the U.S., said in an interview. ""It can all happen at home.""The DisposeRx product has been in use for about six months in hospitals and other locations, according to John Holaday, the company's co-founder and chief executive officer. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said the retailer doesn't have any ownership stake in the Southern Pines, North Carolina-based startup.

43,WBA,"Cigna (CI) just made a bid to join an elite group of health care industry titans with its $67 billion deal to buy drug-benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).X Yet the takeover, which includes $15 billion in assumed debt, comes as something of a shock because Express Scripts and pharmacy benefit managers, in general, have been under fire and unloved on Wall Street. To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share. At Wednesday's close that was equal to 96.03, a 31% premium for Express Scripts.Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal was skeptical. Shares of Cigna closed down 11% at 172.00 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Express Scripts jumped 8.6% to 79.72. Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry. Amazon has flirted with entering the retail drug business and just launched a venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) aimed at lowering health care costs. Washington has amped up the rhetoric on the lack of transparency in drug pricing, and PBMs are seen as a prime suspect. To top it off, Express Scripts had a falling out with Anthem (ANTM), its biggest customer, which accused it of not passing along drug manufacturers' rebates.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

44,WBA,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowExpress Scripts has a purchasing alliance with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), so its merger with Cigna could create the same kind of scale as CVS Health-Aetna. Walgreens recently mulled buying the 76% of drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) that it doesn't already own, according to reports.CVS acquired pharmacy benefit manager Caremark in 2006. UnitedHealth acquired Catamaran, another PBM, in 2015.UnitedHealth this week announced that its OptumRx PBM would directly provide drug rebates to some 7 million insured members through employer plans, an apparent response to pressure on the industry from customers and politicians.Industry players have increasingly seen the stand-alone PBM model, meaning a pharmacy benefit manager that is not owned directly by a major insurer, as being under threat. Anthem is setting up its own in-house PBM while temporarily contracting with CVS.Some analysts had speculated in recent months that Amazon might bid for Express Scripts to ease its entry into the highly regulated and complex prescription industry. Yet the Cigna deal suggests that Amazon wasn't interested — at least not at anything close to the price that Cigna was willing to pay.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveCVS: 'We're Going To Deliver' What Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Seek To DoAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

45,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) beat first-quarter forecasts Thursday morning, and CVS Health (CVS) gave some post-Aetna (AET) merger and post-tax cut guidance, a day after Rite Aid (RAD) matched forecasts for the bottom line.X Estimates: Profit growth of 15.5% to $1.27 a share on 6% sales gains to $30.33 billion.Results: EPS of $1.28 on revenue of $30.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 8.9% to $22.5 billion, as same-store sales grew 4.7%. International retail pharmacy sales grew 4.1% to $3.1 billion as comp decreased 0.7%. Pharmaceutical wholesale sales climbed 5.6% to $5.7 billion as comps increased 4.5%.Outlook: Full-year EPS of $5.45-$5.70 vs. a prior view of $5.40-$5.70, with the new midpoint just above consensus views for $5.54.""I am pleased that we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter, led by continued prescription volume and market share growth in Retail Pharmacy USA,"" said CEO Stefano Pessina in a statement.Stock: Shares tumbled 5.2% to 71.60 on the stock market today. The stock slid over 12% in 2017, and only recently retook support at its 50-day line in late November. Walgreens hasn't come up for air above its 200-day since September.On Thursday, CVS said Q4 EPS would come in at the low end of its $1.88-$1.92 forecast, but said the tax cuts would lower its rate to 27%, boosting cash flow by about $1.2 billion. It also sees 2018 revenue growth of 0.75%-2.5%, while adjusted consolidated operating profit growth will be reduced by about 125 basis points.""With the financial flexibility that tax reform provides, the company anticipates making strategic investments in future areas of growth in its business,"" CVS said in a statement.CVS Health rallied 2.65% to 75.14. CVS Health, which also is a major pharmacy benefits manager, agreed late last year to buy insurance giant Aetna (AET).Estimates: Swing to a loss of 2 cents per share vs. year-ago per-share earnings of 2 cents. Total revenue is seen sliding over 4% to $7.74 billion.Results: Per-share loss of 2 cents from continuing operations on revenue from continuing operations of $5.35 billion, down 5.6% from $5.67 billion a year ago. Retail pharmacy revenue fell 3% to $4 billion, and pharmacy services revenue dropped 12% to $1.4 billion due to less participation in Medicare Part D regions and a decline in commercial business.Same store sales from continuing operations for the quarter decreased 2.5 %, a with 3.5% drop in pharmacy sales and a 0.5% dip in front-end sales.Stock: Shares sank 1.4% to 2.08 on Thursday. Shares have lost over 75% of their value in 2017, amid a drawn-out, failed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance that resulted in Walgreens acquiring slightly fewer than 2,000 Rite Aid stores.""To date, we have transferred 357 stores and have received approximately $715 million in proceeds, which we have used to pay down debt,"" Chairman and CEO John Standley said in a statement.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This $300 Billion Amazon Rumor Just Won't DieIs Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?Retail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

50,WBA,"The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average undercut their 50-day moving averages but on Friday those two indexes and the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly. Walmart (WMT) sold off as earnings, guidance and online sales were weaker than expected. Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal. Walmart stock crashed 10% on Tuesday.Amazon, for its part, reportedly plans to roll out six more cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores after recently opening its first Go store in Seattle to the general public.Federal Reserve policymakers still backed gradual interest rate hikes in 2018 at their Jan. 30-31 meeting. But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time. The 10-year Treasury yield, already up sharply this year, rose to fresh four-year highs, pushing stocks lower Wednesday. Meanwhile, existing-home sales posted their biggest annual drop in 3 years, while applications for loan to buy a home tumbled again.Streaming video platform Roku (ROKU) earned an adjusted 6 cents a share on sales of $188.3 million in Q4, vs. expectations for a loss of 11 cents a share on sales of $183 million. But for the current quarter, Roku expects revenue of $125 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance, vs. Wall Street expectations for $130 million. Roku said its active user base rose 44% year over year to 19.3 million in the fourth quarter. Roku stock plunged on weak guidance.Home Depot (HD) reported adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $1.69 as sales climbed 7.5% to $23.88 billion. Home Depot expects recent tax cuts will fuel continued growth in the housing sector even as mortgage rates climb. Home Depot expects EPS to jump 28% to $9.31 this year. It's projected to buy back $4 billion in shares. Shares rose fractionally for the week.Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) cut its offer to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) to $79 a share in cash and stock from $82 after Qualcomm raised its bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Broadcom said Qualcomm's revised NXP offer amounted to a transfer of value to NXP shareholders. If Qualcomm's purchase of NXP doesn't go through, Broadcom will pay $82 a share. Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD). The combined company, which will be public will have a value of $24 billion, including debt. The deal comes after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave up on an effort last year to buy all of Rite Aid due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores. Merger activity is heading up in the sector as pharmacies look to keep market share in the face of growing competition from Amazon (AMZN).The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.6 million barrels vs. the week prior vs. analyst expectations for a 1.9 million barrel increase, while production was steady at 10.27 million barrels per day. U.S. shale firms Parsley Energy (PE), Continental Resources (CLR), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Concho Resources (CXO) see higher production this year as oil prices rebound.Planet Fitness (PLNT) saw EPS climb 20% to 24 cents a share as revenue grew 16% to $134 million. The fitness-chain operator, whose affordable offerings have resonated with casual and first-time gym users, expects full-year sales to increase by roughly 20% and adjusted EPS to grow by about 40%. Planet Fitness also added $80 million to its stock buyback program. Shares rallied 12% on Friday.The two halves of the former Hewlett-Packard reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings. HP Enterprise (HPE), the server, networking equipment and data center gear maker also gave upbeat Q2 guidance, hiked its dividend 50% and boosted its stock buyback program. Printer-and-PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) also guided higher for Q2 and the full year. HPE and HP Inc. shares jumped Friday.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) came up short on sales, but its stock appeared to be propped up by a report saying that Burger King-parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) was thinking about making a bid.

The news comes on the heels of the proposed merger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) announced late last year.Inside the IBD 50, Weibo (WB) was the star of the day, soaring 9.7% on strong earnings. It was a muscular move, but Weibo recently flashed a sell signal from a handle entry at 122.31 as well as an alternate entry at 123.10. Note that its latest breakout was from a later-stage base. The company operates a social-media platform in China.Sina (SINA), which spun off Weibo in 2014 but remains a majority shareholder, jumped 6%, also on solid earnings.Elsewhere, after a failed breakout over a 52.97 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD 50 name HealthEquity (HQY) is still in buy range from a new handle entry at 52.53.

In another blow to Express Scripts that month, health insurer Anthem (ATHM) said it will tie up with CVS on pharmacy benefit management in 2020, after its current contract with Express Scripts ends.Express Scripts stock has since recovered amid speculation that Amazon may be hunting for a pharmacy benefits manager to gain a foothold in the $300 billion business.On Nov. 30, Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said he would be open to a deal at the right price, though he wasn't actively looking for one, telling Bloomberg that, ""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have.""He added that a partnership with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement is also possible.But CVS, which is a major pharmacy benefits manager in its own right, said earlier this month that it will buy health insurer Aetna for $69 billion, with the deal coming as it braces for Amazon to enter the retail prescription business.Some analysts also say the deal would give the combined company an edge over rivals, with stronger negotiating leverage vs. drug manufacturers.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) said they'd give employees $1,000 each following the tax cuts. Southwest also said it would invest in modernizing its Boeing (BA) fleet.Winning high rollers reportedly weighed on December casino revenue, which came in light at 14.6% growth vs. Bloomberg views for 20% gains.

61,WBA,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms
"
62,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

Can the space climb higher still this year? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the group and strong performers within it.Express Scripts also has four Blue Cross Blue Shield contracts up for bid in 2019, worth about $8.5 billion in drug spending, he estimated.Adding to that pressure, web giant Amazon is rumored to be considering an entrance into the online prescription drug sales market with a decision expected before Thanksgiving.

Walgreens climbed 0.1% to 82.60.Months of negotiations with regulators followed the initial 2015 merger announcement, and Walgreens in late June nixed buyout talks, agreeing instead to acquire half of Rite Aid's locations for about $5.2 billion, plus a $325 million termination fee.Fred's (FRED), which was set to acquire 865 Rite Aid stores and will get a termination fee as a result of the abandoned merger, sank 4.6% to 7.06.RELATED:Amid FTC Pushback On Rite Aid Buyout, Walgreens Splits The DifferenceStock Market Hat Trick: Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 All Take New HighsQ3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

69,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has been cleared by the government to buy 1,932 Rite Aid (RAD) stores and other property for $4.375 billion in cash, following months of attempts to ease regulators' antitrust concerns over a deal between the two drugstore giants.The deal announced Tuesday replaces the one announced in June, when Walgreens had already settled for buying 2,186 Rite Aid's stores — roughly half of what it originally intended — and other assets for around $5.18 billion following resistance from the Federal Trade Commission.Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 1.7% in the stock market today, while Rite Aid sank 12.1%.The announcement came a day after Bloomberg reported that Walgreens was set to amend its agreement to buy more than 2,000 Rite Aid locations.Walgreens said it would start buying the stores, located largely in the Northeast and Southern U.S., in October and finish next spring. The deal also includes three distribution centers and other inventory.After the purchases are completed, the stores will eventually be converted to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens said it doesn't expect the deal to have much effect on adjusted earnings per share during the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.That agreement followed months of attempts to appease regulators, who were concerned a tie-up between the two companies would create a company that would be too big to be friendly to competition, even with offers to sell many stores and other assets to Fred's (FRED). Walgreens first announced its plans to buy Rite Aid in 2015.RELATED:Walgreens To Revise Rite Aid Deal To Quell Antitrust Worries: ReportAmid FTC Pushback On Rite Aid Buyout, Walgreens Splits The DifferenceSign Of The Times: Kohl's Will Start Accepting Amazon ReturnsRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

70,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) on Thursday said it would limit some opioid prescriptions to seven days and cap daily dosage based on an opioid's strength, part of the pharmacy giant's efforts to deal with a nationwide opioid crisis.X""Prescription and nonprescription opioid misuse is now considered among the most urgent health crises in our country,"" the company said in a statement. ""The opioid epidemic touches all of the communities we serve, and as a pharmacy innovation company, we are in a unique position to make a difference.""The company also said that it would add in-store disposal units in 750 pharmacies to allow consumers to get rid of leftover medication they don't want. Those additions would follow the company's donation of more than 800 medication disposal units to police departments nationwide in recent years. The company also said it would strengthen a variety of counseling and awareness efforts.CVS currently offers opioid prescriptions that last at least 20 days to many patients with acute pain that the company covers, CVS' chief medical officer told the Wall Street Journal.Painkillers remain a multibillion-dollar industry for pharmaceutical companies. As a recent IBD article noted, the FDA has approved some ""abuse-deterrent"" opioids, which can be more difficult to crush and snort. But the extra tests required for such drugs can be costly, while cheaper generic alternatives are available and addicts can still find ways to abuse the drugs regardless.Biotechs like Cara Therapeutics (CARA) are among those trying to develop products that aren't as addictive.Meanwhile, the cannabis industry has increasingly tried to market itself as an alternative to opioid painkillers. GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) has developed a seizure-fighting drug based on cannabidiol, or CBD, a component of the marijuana plant that is used as a relaxant.Shares of CVS fell 1.4% to 79.56 in the stock market today, a day after falling 2.9% on a report that Amazon.com (AMZN) may be getting into the pharmacy benefit-management market. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is acquiring nearly 2,000 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, lost 0.8%. Cara Therapeutics dipped 0.2%. GW Pharmaceuticals slipped 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As the cannabis industry booms, CBD, a non-psychoactive part of marijuana, could lead the way in mainstream adoption of the plant. Companies like GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) remain ways into the industry. For more on CBD products, read this story.The announcement Thursday from CVS comes as addiction to oxycodone, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs become entrenched in communities and the broader economy.Heroin use more than doubled between 2002 and last year, while deaths linked to the drug jumped more than six times over that period, government data show. Opioid use by men alone could have helped drive some 20% of the drop in their participation in the national labor force, a Princeton University economist recently estimated, according to a Bloomberg story this monthRELATED:Is Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?Marijuana Investing Goes Wall Street: More Ties, Less Tie-Dye

72,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) said they have complied with a Federal Trade Commission request for information about their planned merger, an announcement that gives the FTC 60 days to approve or halt the potential tie-up.The announcement, made on Monday, comes after a series of roadblocks to the deal, which would combine the second and third largest drugstore chains and create a more formidable rival to CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has proposed selling Rite Aid locations to the struggling pharmacy chain Fred's (FRED) in attempt to assuage concerns the deal would harm competition.A plan to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's didn't convince the government; the offer was raised to as many as 1,200. Sources told Bloomberg that the FTC has worried about Fred's ability to still compete if Walgreens actually buys Rite Aid.Walgreens originally planned to pay $9 a share for Rite, but cut that to $6.50-$7 earlier this year, with the specific price based on how many Rite Aid stores were sold to win FTC approval.Walgreens was up 0.2% to 85.98 on the stock market today. Rite Aid edged up 2 cents to 4.07. Fred's climbed 4.6% to 15.64. CVS climbed 5 cents to 81.10.RELATED:Rite Aid Finally Gets Some Good News As Walgreens Deal In Doubt

73,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) shares retreated Tuesday after the drug store and pharmacy benefit management giant topped first-quarter earnings estimates but reported pharmacy sales and Q2 guidance that failed to lived up to some forecasts.Estimates: A 7% profit drop to $1.10 a share, while revenue rising 2% to $44.2 billion.Results: CVS earned $1.17 a share adjusted, with revenue up to $44.51 billion. Pharmacy same-store sales slid 4.7%, more than some estimates. CVS lost some key pharmacy contracts over the past year.Outlook: CVS sees Q2 EPS of $1.29-$1.33 a share, with the midpoint below some estimates.Stock: Shares fell 3.6% to 79 in the stock market today, still below their key 200-day moving average after breaching support at the level last August. The stock is finding to hold above its 50-day line after retaking that key level on April 20.Why It Matters: CVS' pharmacy benefits manager unit (PBM) is seen potentially gaining from Express Scripts' (ESRX) expected loss of Anthem as a customer, though Anthem (ANTM) gave mixed signals about that.The Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) multibillion-dollar merger struggle continues to drag on.

74,WBA,"XDrugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that topped views, while its takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) remains in doubt.Estimates: Wall Street expected a 2-cent per-share loss, down from a profit of 6 cents a share a year ago. Revenue was seen as roughly flat, at $8.265 billion.Results: Rite Aid reported break-even results on an adjusted basis, with revenue up 3.3% to $8.5 billion. Same-store sales slid 3%.Stock: Shares climbed 6.4% to 3.97 on the stock market today after hitting a 3-1/2-year low on Monday. Walgreens Boots Alliance rose nearly 2%, moving above its 50-day line.Fred's (FRED) climbed 4.6%, after naming new board members late Monday. CVS Health (CVS) rose 2.65%, due to CVS' pharmacy benefits manager side possibly benefiting from Express Scripts (ESRX) likely to lose Anthem (ANTM) as a key customer.IBD'S TAKE: Deutsche Bank believes that Rite Aid's stock could dive more than 50% if Rite Aid's merger with Walgreens doesn't go through.Walgreens originally agreed to pay $9 per share for Rite Aid in 2015 in a deal worth $9.4 billion at the time. It came amid a wave of health-industry moves to consolidate and keep expenses in check as the Affordable Care Act brought insurance to more people.When the agreement was struck, Bloomberg noted that Walgreens would modernize Rite Aid's stores and gear them more toward beauty and wellness, while Walgreens would gain access to the drug-benefit management market for employers and insurers where CVS Health competes.To pass antitrust muster, Walgreens planned to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's but that still wasn't enough to ease regulators' concerns that that tie-up could hurt competition.So earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest, as the Federal Trade Commission reportedly considered blocking the deal.The potential number of Rite Aid stores that could be sold has since been bumped up to as many as 1,200. But regulators' doubts have grown about Fred's ability to absorb that many stores.Early this month, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he was ""still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion. But there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected.""Last week, Bloomberg, citing a report from the trade publication Capitol Forum, said that the Federal Trade Commission was considering suing to block Walgreens' attempt to buy the company.An merger expiration extension suggests Walgreens will keep fighting to win over the FTC, perhaps after President Trump gets new commissioners to fill empty seats.RELATED:Walgreens CEO On Rite Aid: 'I Am Still Positive On This Deal'New Walgreens Report Sends Rite Aid Stock Plunging Again

76,WBA,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average.

88,WBA,"Rite Aid (RAD) reports fiscal fourth-quarter results early Tuesday, as its potential $7 billion merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) faces fresh doubts.Analysts expect a 2-cent per-share loss, swinging from the profit of 6 cents a share the drugstore chain saw a year ago. Revenue is expected to be essentially flat at $8.265 billion.Shares of Rite Aid fell 1.8% to 3.73 the stock market today, continuing to stray further from the original deal price. Earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover price from $9 a share to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest. Rival CVS Health (CVS) edged up 1% to 80.05.Rite Aid stock has seen an avalanche of selling as the merger deal with Walgreens, first agreed to in 2015, hit hurdle after hurdle. The subject seems likely to come up when Rite Aid reports.Early this month, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he was ""still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion. But there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected.""IBD'S TAKE: Deutsche Bank believes that Rite Aid's stock could dive more than 50% if Rite Aid's merger with Walgreens doesn't go through. Last week, Bloomberg, citing a report from the trade publication Capitol Forum, said that the Federal Trade Commission was considering suing to block Walgreens' attempt to buy the company.Shares of Rite Aid sank on the news, as did those of discounter Fred's (FRED), which is set to buy up to 1,200 Rite Aid stores. That divestiture, intended to appease regulators worried that the size of the combined company would harm competition, could roughly triple Fred's store count.Walgreens' initial plans to sell 865 stores to Fred's weren't enough for the FTC. Walgreens and Rite Aid in January also cut the per-share price of the deal, whose deadline has been pushed back as the companies work with regulators.Meanwhile, Rite Aid also faces competition as its industry consolidates, Zacks noted.Shares of Walgreens rose 0.3%; Fred's climbed 4.1%.RELATED:Rite Aid Rises As Trump Names Acting FTC Chief

89,WBA,"Analyst actions on Friday included price target hikes for Nike (NKE), Micron Technology (MU) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), an upgrade for Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and a downgrade for Rite Aid (RAD).XDeutsche Bank raised its price target for Nike to 69 from 63, keeping a buy rating, after the Dow Jones industrial average component topped fiscal Q4 earnings and sales estimates. Analyst Paul Trussell said that Nike's long-term prospects look good after a challenging year, endorsing its ""Consumer Direct Offense"" strategy, which includes the pilot plan announced on Thursday to sell an assortment of footwear, apparel and accessories via Amazon (AMZN).Goldman Sachs previously estimated that selling footwear directly through Amazon could add up to $500 million in revenue for Nike.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy still saw reasons for concern, including an apparent acceleration of market share gains by Adidas (ADDYY). She kept a 50 target and neutral rating.Shares of Nike jumped 11% to 59 on the stock market today, rising as high as 59.71 intraday, a 10-month high and briefly topping a 59.10 buy point.Stifel raised its price target on the memory-chip maker to 60 from 47 keeping a buy rating, after Micron beat fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday, while guiding higher for the current quarter.Analyst Kevin Cassidy says fundamentals for the memory market have transformed, with diverse end markets and rational capacity growth driving profit gains. He boosted his EPS estimate by $1.42 to $6.00 for 2018 vs. a consensus of $5.25.Other research firms also hiked their price targets, though to a lesser degree. Deutsche Bank lifted its target to 37 from 35, with a buy rating. JPMorgan raised its target to 40 from 38, with an overweight rating.Shares of Micron rose overnight, but closed down 5.1% to 29.86, back below a 29.97 buy point and just above the 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investments.Needham upgraded Walgreens to buy from hold, giving it a 94 target after the drugstore chain scrapped its plan to buy Rite Aid amid antitrust scrutiny.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were mildly lower, down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.XAmong the Dow industrials, financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) led the pack, advancing about 2% each after they got the OK from the Federal Reserve to boost dividends and buybacks. JP Morgan broke out above a choppy 89.23 double-bottom entry Wednesday.On the downside, Microsoft (MSFT) declined 1.2% after Wednesday's bullish reversal off the 50-day line.

Both are trading just above their 50-day moving average lines.Among companies reporting earnings, Constellation Brands (STZ) jumped about 7% after reporting strong Q1 earnings, but weak quarterly sales. After a brief pullback to the 50-day line a few weeks ago, the stock is about 18% above a 165.98 cup-with-handle entry. Acuity Brands (AYI) surged about 12% after its Q3 earnings and sales figures beat the Street's forecasts.After the bell, apparel maker Nike (NKE) will report its fiscal-Q4 earnings. Analysts expect the Dow component to earn 50 cents per share on revenues amounting to $8.63 billion. The stock has been in a long-term downtrend as it sits under its 50- and 200-day lines.Meanwhile, Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA) put an end to its merger agreement with Rite Aid (RAD).

91,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) ended months of back and forth with regulators over its buyout of Rite Aid (RAD) by scrapping the deal Thursday and instead announcing a new one for just half of Rite Aid's stores.XWalgreens will pay $5.18 billion for 2,186 stores plus a $325 million termination fee to Rite Aid, which pulled out of a separate deal with Fred's (FRED), the pharmacy chain that would've received 865 Rite Aid's stores under the prior deal with Walgreens. Fred's will get a $25 million termination fee.Under the new deal, which is expected to close within six months, Walgreens sees the Rite Aid stores adding to adjusted earnings in the first year and creating $400 million in synergiesMeanwhile, Walgreens reported fiscal Q3 results that topped views. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 beat consensus forecasts by 2 cents, and sales of $30.1 billion topped estimates of $29.68 billion.The company raised the low end of its 2017 EPS outlook and now sees $4.98-$5.08, up from a prior view of $4.90-$5.08. Wall Street sees $5.00.Rite Aid also reported quarterly results, swinging to an adjusted Q1 loss of 5 cents a share, as revenue fell 4.9% to $7.8 billion. Same-store sales dropped 3.9%, with pharmacy sales down 5% and front-end sales down 1.5%.Walgreens shares closed up 1.7% at 78.37 in the stock market today after hitting 81.55 in the morning. Rite Aid sank 26.5% to 2.89, hitting their worst levels in nearly four years. Fred's collapsed 23% to 9.51. CVS Health (CVS) retreated 1.2%.The new deal follows nearly two years of will-they, won't-they drama surrounding the initial merger agreement, which was first announced in October 2015.More recently, Rite Aid shares vaulted 30% on Monday on a report that the Federal Trade Commission was ""more likely than not"" to approve the merger. But earlier this month, Rite Aid stock crashed on reports the FTC was preparing ""advice"" to block the merger with Walgreens.The FTC had until July 7 to approve or deny the merger. The combination would've fuse together the second and third largest drugstore chains to create a massive rival to CVS Health.Zacks, in a research note this month, said that Rite Aid has focused more on making over its wellness stores, which feature things like vision and diabetic diagnostic centers, and growing its clinical and pharmacy offerings.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens also face growing competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), which have broadened their pharmacy businesses, Zacks said.RELATED:Rite Aid Stock Just Had Its Best Gain In 20 Months As Walgreens Deadline NearsAre These Amazon's Next Five Targets?

93,WBA,"Stocks kept a lustrous shine with an hour to go in Monday's bullish advance. IBD-style breakouts showed oomph, adding to the argument that it's still a good market for growth investors.The current outlook, as seen in the IBD Big Picture, has remained ""Uptrend under pressure"" for months due to a high distribution day count. Watch to see if that outlook changes after Monday's market close.The Nasdaq composite gained 1.2%, bolstered by gains in the chip, computer, data storage, telecom gear and software industries. But the NYSE composite slightly outperformed, up almost 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both rallied around 1.1%.Volume was running nearly 9% higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday and a tad lower on the NYSE. Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly stock and index options.Within the S&P 500, banks and select names in the consumer goods, industrial and automotive sectors led the way as at least 18 names rallied 3% or more. They included Star Wars toy supplier Hasbro (HAS) (up 6% to 101.70 on a 42% jump in first-quarter earnings per share), SunTrust Banks (STI), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Delphi Automotive (DLPH) and shirt maker PVH Corp. (PVH).Delphi and PVH both retook their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, respectively, a sign that institutions are gaining more confidence in consumer-oriented industries. Hasbro is showing excellent action since it displayed an earnings-inspired breakaway gap on Feb. 6, clearing an 88.06 early entry in the process.Hasbro spent just 10 days below the 50-day line prior to Monday's buying rush, and volume spiked nearly five times its 50-day average of 1.13 billion shares. The move back above the 50-day line serves as a chance to add shares to a winning position in the stock.Hasbro's Composite Rating of 81 is hampered in part by a decent but not great EPS Rating of 89. Yet after Monday's quarterly results, watch to see if the toymaker's ratings go up at IBD Stock Checkup. Plus, the stock's RS line powered into new high ground, a good sign.Also on the upside, recent breakouts by lithium metal miner Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM) of Chile, Fortinet (FTNT) and Macom Technologies (MTSI) showed gusto. SQM jumped nearly 2.5% to 36.50, holding above a recent flat-base breakout at 34.94.SQM is expected to grow full-year profit 34% to $1.42 a share on a 5% lift in revenue to $2.04 billion.Fortinet, which joined IBD Leaderboard several weeks ago, added to Friday's solid gain, rising 1% to 39.93. The security software play and midcap name is now almost 4% past a 38.43 proper buy point. Don't chase stocks that are already more than 5% past the proper entry.Fortinet gets strong ratings from IBD, including a 90 Composite Rating and an 84 RS. Macom, which gapped up at the open and rose 3.7% to 53.66, boasts even stronger proprietary ratings (98 Composite, 88 RS, 95 EPS) as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The stock is rapidly rising past a 52.32 entry on a five-month cup with handle.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Fortinet's first-quarter earnings up just 7% to 16 cents a share, a significant decline from gains of 88%, 27%, 29% and 67% in the prior four quarters. The difficult year-over-year comp is one factor. However, keep in mind that the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm smashed Wall Street consensus views in three of the past four quarters. In those three periods, the average beat was 32%.Macom's base features a less than 20% decline from the cup's high to low, well within the normal range for excellent versions of this tried-and-true bullish stock chart pattern. The cup with handle allows investors to time their buys at the point where a stock is best poised to break out and run to new highs. When a stock is at new highs, every investor is happy, except the short sellers.On the downside, Rite Aid (RAD) continued to slump badly, down 2% to 3.72. News reports continue to focus on the rising chance that pharmacy chain rival Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA) will not be able to merge. Rite Aid, which sports a terrible EPS Rating of 11, is expected to post an 83% plunge in 2017 earnings to 4 cents a share. The stock had broken out of a deep, low-priced cup with handle at 2.15 in the week ended April 12, 2013, but now shares look poised to fall further as it struggles to rise back above the steeply falling 10-week moving average.RELATED:The Case For Gold: Can It Become A Solid Long-Term Play Again?Earnings News: Will Rite Aid Post Another Quarterly New Loss?

94,WBA,"If the Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal doesn't happen, Rite Aid shares could slide 53% to about 2.25 a share, while Walgreens' stock could take an up-to-14% beating to 73-79 a share, said Deutsche Bank, according to a note acquired by The Fly.Rite Aid shares tumbled 4.9% to 4.48 in the stock market today, hitting their lowest level since October 2014.Shares of Rite Aid rallied last week on reports that its acquirer could offer to shed more stores in a bid to get the Federal Trade Commission's approval, but that is in the wake of a sharp downturn as uncertainty continues to dog the merger. The stock has slid over 44% in 2017.Earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover price from $9 a share to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest.Bloomberg reported on Friday that Walgreens was close to hammering out a new agreement, one that would likely include the sale of more than the previously agreed-upon 865 Rite Aid stores to smaller drugstore chain Fred's (FRED).Walgreens shares fell 1.7% to 83.21, undercutting the 50-day moving average. Fred's tumbled 6.3% to 13.74, its lowest close of the year.Rival CVS Health (CVS) dipped 0.3%.RELATED:Rite Aid Rallies As Walgreens Reportedly Mulls New FTC StrategyRite Aid Continues Nose-Dive As Walgreens Takeover Doubts Grow

95,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could soon make a new offer to try to win Federal Trade Commission approval for its takeover of Rite Aid (RAD).The drugstore giant is close to a deal to sell more Rite Aid stores and assets to Fred's (FRED), Bloomberg reported, citing sources.Walgreens Boots Alliance would likely divest more Rite Aid stores than the 865 locations that it and Fred agreed to late last year, Bloomberg said. Distribution centers and some key personnel could also shift from Rite Aid to Fred's. Regulators reportedly have been worried that Fred's wouldn't be a viable competitor under the original deal.IBD'S TAKE: Brick-and-mortar stores are struggling generally. But Sector Leaders highlights this top-rated chain carving out a beautiful retail niche.Rite Aid shares, which nearly hit its lowest intraday mark since October 2014, rallied to climb 3% to 4.87. Rite Aid is still down 19% so far this month and 41% in 2017.Walgreens originally agreed to pay $9 a share for Rite Aid back in October 2014. But after the deal terms expired earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its offer to $6.50-$7 a share, depending on how many Rite Aid stores have to be sold. So a revised store-divestment deal may help boost the odds of an FTC OK, but also limit the upside for investors.Fred's rose 3.6% to 15.31. Walgreens dipped 0.25% to 85.40 as the stock continues to consolidate over the past three months despite all the regulatory uncertainty.Investors have seen numerous reports citing unnamed sources claiming various developments: The FTC will OK the deal, the FTC will reject the merger, Walgreens will try to force the FTC to make a decision quickly. But the merger is still in limbo.RELATED:Rite Aid Continues Nose-Dive As Walgreens Takeover Doubts Grow

96,WBA,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege.

It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday. Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea, rose 1.5% and remained in buy range from a 152.68 flat-base entry. Lockheed Martin (LMT) lifted 1.2% to just above a 270 buy point. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9% and Boeing (BA) 0.8%. Boeing makes joint direct-attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons.Constellation Brands (STZ) reported that Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $1.48 a share as revenue rose 5.5% to $1.63 billion.

97,WBA,"Rite Aid (RAD) stock kept plunging Wednesday as investors worry that the Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) takeover won't ever close.Shares of Rite Aid sank 7.2% to 4.65 on the stock market today, falling to their worst levels since October 2014. That follows a 4.2% slide on Wednesday. Rite Aid is down 22.5% so far this month.Walgreens Boots Alliance is mulling a move to force the Federal Trade Commission to finally rule on its proposed Rite Aid takeover, the New York Post reported Tuesday.Walgreens could declare that it has ""certified compliance"" with its application, meaning that it has given all the key information needed for regulators to make a decision.That would force the FTC to rule within 30 days on the merger, first announced in late 2015. There are just two commissioners currently on the five-person FTC: Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, and Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat. Walgreens may believe that it's unlikely for the duo to jointly oppose the merger.Walgreens shares fell 1% to 85.16 on Wednesday. Walgreens is in a cup-with-handle base with a potential 88.10 buy point.But Rite Aid stock slid 4.2% to 5.01, the lowest since October 2014 and extending a sharp recent sell-off.Meanwhile smaller rival Fred's (FRED), which has agreed to buy 865 Rite Aid stores for some $950 million to try to ease antitrust concerns, lost 2.5% on Wednesday after skidding 3.6% on Tuesday. The Rite Aid deal is contingent on the Walgreens takeover getting the go-ahead. Also, regulators reportedly have concerns over whether Fred's can successfully absorb that many locations.Walgreens agreed to buy Rite Aid for $9 a share in October 2015. In January, after the merger deal expired, Walgreens cut the price to $6.50-$7 a share depending on how many Rite Aid stores must be sold.RELATED:Rite Aid Tanks As Walgreens Slashes Takeover Price

101,WBA,"XShares of Rite-Aid (RAD) surged 12% on Monday, clocking their biggest jump since October 2015, when the drugstore chain's now-troubled merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was first announced.The reasons for the gains were unclear. They come amid questions over whether that merger will go through, and speculation over whether Amazon (AMZN) might jump into the pharmacy business and, potentially, try to acquire Rite Aid if the deal collapses.The speculation follows Amazon's announcement that it had agreed to buy Whole Foods (WFM), a deal that could redraw the retail landscape. Shares of Walgreens and CVS Health (CVS) retreated on the Amazon-Whole Foods announcement Friday. Both Walgreens and CVS sell a lot of groceries, and there's speculation that Amazon could eventually enter the pharmacy business in some fashion. Rite Aid edged higher on Friday.According to a StreetInsider post, among the factors that may have been driving Rite Aid shares higher Monday were Amazon's possible interest in the No. 3 U.S. drugstore operator, the fact that the FTC has yet to block the Walgreens takeover, and the possibility that Walgreens would fight the FTC if it did oppose the merger.The FTC has until July 7 to approve or block the merger.Rite Aid rose 12% to 3.36 in the stock market today, after hitting 3.49 intraday. Rite Aid is well below Walgreens' revised $6.50-$7-a-share deal price.Walgreens climbed 1.8% to 79.81 while CVS advanced 1.4%. Amazon climbed 0.8%, but well off intraday highs. Whole Foods rose 1.3% to 43.22, moving further above Amazon's $42-a-share deal price.Fred's (FRED), which has a deal to buy a large number of Rite Aid stores and other assets to try to win FTC approval for the merger, fell 2.1%.RELATED:Whole Foods Stock Signals Another Bidder Is Coming, But Who?Amazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, Eateries

102,WBA,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

103,WBA,"After missing Friday's merger deadline, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) are extending their agreement end date to July 31, slashing the takeover price and changing other terms in a bid to get regulatory approval.Walgreens will now pay a minimum of $6.50 per share and a maximum of $7 a share, according to a joint press release, depending on how many Rite Aid stores are to be divested in order to pass regulatory muster. The original deal was worth $9 per share.Under the new terms, Walgreens will sell up to 1,200 Rite Aid stores and certain other assets, if needed, marking a 200 store increase from the original agreement. The drugstore giant will acquire Rite Aid for $7 a share if 1,000 or fewer stores must be sold; it will pay $6.50 a share if it winds up having to divest 1,200 stores. (The price will undergo a pro rata adjustment if that store count falls somewhere in the middle.)It's still unclear if the Federal Trade Commission will approve the merger.Shares of Rite Aid plunged 17.5% to 5.72 in the stock market today. Walgreens shares fell 2 cents to 81.48. CVS Health (CVS) shares climbed 1.2%.Last week, reports surfaced that private-equity firm Cerberus might be open to buying the 865 stores that Rite Aid had initially planned to sell to smaller peer Fred's (FRED) to get the regulatory OK.Fred's shares rose 1.3% to 14.29, off session highs for 15.22.

105,WBA,"The adoption of credit-card chip technology by U.S. retailers is having an unintended consequence: Criminals are moving from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet.The use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialing call centers surged 40% last year, according to a report from Javelin Strategy & Research released Wednesday. That's forcing merchants to spend billions on online fraud protection in an effort to detect when a crook is using someone else's card number.""We are seeing more sophisticated type of fraud moving into the online environment,"" said Erika Dietrich, global director of payments risk management at fraud fighter ACI Worldwide (ACIW).By the end of last year, almost 1.81 million U.S. merchants had switched to accepting European-style chip cards, more than double the number the year before, according to Visa (V) Issued by banks, cards containing the so-called EMV technology are much harder to counterfeit, which cuts down on in-person fraud at stores.With worldwide e-commerce surging and more stolen data available on the black market, retailers are ramping up spending on online security. E-commerce merchants and financial institutions will spend $9.2 billion annually in fraud-detection solutions by 2020, up 30% from current levels, according to Juniper Research.As recently as October, the fraud-protection company Radial Inc. used to get one to two inquiries from new large customers a month. That number has since climbed to more than 12 a month, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer. Radial's more than 100 clients include Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), StubHub and Ralph Lauren (RL).Fueling the surge in interest are an increasing number of data breaches at companies ranging from Target (TGT) to Wendy's (WEN), which potentially exposed private financial information from millions of customers to identity thieves. U.S. government agencies and companies suffered a record 1,093 data breaches last year, up 40% from 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.""There's a great deal of investment not only from StubHub peers, but also from the vendors,"" said Joseph Asaro, head of operations for North America at StubHub, a unit of eBay (EBAY). ""The vendors would not be investing so heavily if there's not great profit in it.""To bolster its arsenal, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce in December to help merchants and banks authenticate e-commerce transactions. New vendors are also entering the fray: This year, Tender Armor LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based startup, will offer its fraud-fighting technology to debit-card customers of InComm Holdings, which issues prepaid cards. Tender Armor texts or e-mails customers a daily code that replaces the one on the back of their cards for purchases.""Because the code is dynamic and only known to the consumer, the fraudsters can't use it,"" Madeline Aufseeser, Tender Armor's chief executive, said in an interview. ""This simple solution deputizes the consumers and puts the control back in their hands.""Meanwhile, payment processor Cayan, which serves mid- to small-sized businesses, plans to integrate security software from Kount. That company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help merchants pinpoint fraudulent sales. For each transaction, Kount's engine analyzes hundreds of relevant variables and activity across the globe in real time to predict risk of fraud.Existing fraud-fighting companies' business is blooming. Easy Solutions says sales of its product that helps banks and retailers monitor transactions grew 128 last year, up from a 75% gain in 2015. Radial, which promises to shoulder its clients' fraud costs, saw its sales rise 15% last year.Radial's software can use about 800 rules to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Suspicious transactions are flagged and sent to several dozen human analysts around the world who can verify addresses, or even call the customers to weed out fraud.""They do detective work at some point,"" said the company's Weitz. ""We guarantee to our customers that they pay zero fraud.""Online sales worldwide are projected to rise to $27.7 trillion in 2020, up from $22 trillion last year, according to researcher eMarketer. North America, the second-largest e-commerce market in the world behind Asia, is expected to see double-digit growth through 2020, eMarketer said. Expansion into new categories such as grocery, and increasing sales through mobile devices are helping to boost sales, the company said.More shopping online means more opportunities for crooks, who are now using sophisticated attack tools such as bots. The software programs can run through online checkout pages and place orders using stolen data automatically — without a human being needing to be involved.""Right now the environment is more challenging than it's ever been,"" said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin, a consulting firm focused on the financial industry. ""And things will get worse before they get better.""

106,WBA,"Shares of Rite Aid (RAD) crashed on reports that the Federal Trade Commission was preparing ""advice"" to block the drugstore chain's merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).The news was reported by Bloomberg, citing Capital Forum.Shares of Rite Aid sank 15% to 3 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels since August 2013. Walgreens dipped 0.6%. Rival CVS Health (CVS) edged up 1.6%, retaking its 50-day line.The report follows growing doubts from the government about the deal, which would combine the second and third largest drugstore chains, and its potential to harm competition.Walgreens had initially agreed to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to pharmacy chain Fred's (FRED), then upped its offer to 1,200 stores, after regulators didn't think the original number was enough. The company this year also cut its takeover price.Last month, Rite Aid and Walgreens said they had complied with the FTC's request for information about the potential merger, initiating a 60-day countdown for the agency to give the deal a thumbs up or thumbs down.Shares of Fred closed off 0.5% at 11.28 after falling intraday to a 2017 low of 10.60.RELATED:Rite Aid Finally Gets Some Good News As Walgreens Deal In Doubt

Consumer spending rose at a 1.1% rate, revised up from 0.6%. Economists expect growth near 3% in the just-ending second quarter, resulting in a steady but unimpressive 2.2% rate for the first half of the year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, the PCE price index, rose just 1.4% from a year ago in May, down from the 2.1% annual gain in February. Core PCE inflation, stripping out food and energy, slipped to 1.4% from 1.8% in February, undercutting the case for near-term rate hikes.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi put investors on notice that his days of bond buying to boost the economy and elevate asset prices are winding down. Stock prices took a tumble, particularly technology stocks, after Draghi's Tuesday speech that economists interpreted as a signal that the ECB will begin to taper off its bond purchases by the start of 2018. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer both talked about fairly rich equity prices as the U.S. central bank gears up to begin slowly unwinding its financial crisis asset purchases later this year. The takeaway: Less supportive central banks will be a headwind for stocks, but not a hurricane, as long as policymakers don't move too fast.RELATED:Draghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market SupportThe Federal Reserve OK'd JPMorgan, Citigroup and all other large U.S. banks to move forward with their dividend and buyback increases after the central bank released results from part two of its annual stress tests.

109,WBA,"Rite Aid (RAD) erased steep intraday losses to turn slightly positive Friday on a report that private-equity firm Cerberus could step in as a white knight to help save the $9.4 billion takeover deal by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Cerberus is open to buying the 865 stores that Rite Aid planned to sell to smaller rival Fred's (FRED) to allay antitrust concerns, the New York Post reported. Cerberus had bid for those stores last year via its Albertsons grocery store chain, the Post said, but Walgreens and Rite Aid feared that the Federal Trade Commission would not like a private equity buyer. But one reason why the FTC reportedly has been reluctant to approve the deal is over concerns that Fred's would not be viable competitor.The Post also cited sources that the FTC is not inclined to block the deal.The reports comes as the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal officially expires today. Most analysts have expected Walgreens and Rite Aid to extend the $9-a-share merger deal. The drugstore giants already extended their original expiration date from Oct. 27 to Jan. 27.Rite Aid rose 2.2% to 6.93 on the stock market today. The stock fell nearly 8% intraday to 6.26, the lowest since the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal was announced in October 2015.Walgreens shares climbed 0.3% to 81.50.Fred's, which could be left in the cold if it loses the Rite Aid store deal, sank 2.35% to 14.11, closing just above its 50-day line.

111,WBA,"Rite Aid (RAD) shares rose in late trading as President Trump named Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican on the Federal Trade Commission, as acting FTC chairwoman, as investors worry whether the regulator will approve the Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) takeover of its smaller drug store rival.Ohlhausen serves with two Democrats, outgoing Chairwoman Edith Ramirez who exits in February and Democrat Terrell McSweeny. But the FTC has two vacancies —  soon to be three — giving Trump an opportunity to create a GOP majority on the FTC that likely would be more favorable to merger deals such as Walgreens-Rite Aid than during the Obama administration.That will take some weeks or months however, while the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal expires on Friday, Jan. 27. The drug store giants previously extended their deal expiration from Oct. 27 to give regulators more time. Walgreens CEO was mum Tuesday on whether another extension was in the works, but the New York Post reported that the companies will do so, citing sources.Rite Aid shares rose 2.2% to 7.05 in late trading. Rite Aid fell 5 cents to 6.90 on the stock market today, down 20% over the past four sessions. Evercore ISI has said that Rite Aid stock might be worth 3.50 if the deal doesn't go through.Walgreens, which has fallen more modestly in recent days, rose 1% to 82.03, retaking its 200-day line. It was little changed late.Walgreens originally agreed to buy Rite Aid for $9 a share back in October 2015. Late last year, Rite Aid agreed to sell 865 stores to smaller rival Fred's (FRED) to try to satisfy antitrust regulators.The FTC was widely expected to OK the merger deal before Obama left office on Jan. 20, but reportedly is concerned that the sale of stores to Fred's would not be sufficient.Fred's shares closed down 2% to 14.84 on Wednesday, down 19% over four sessions. Shares were little changed late.
"
112,WBA,"Just a day ahead of its merger deadline, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is said to be still working on its deal with Rite Aid (RAD).Walgreens chief Stefano Pessina said at the annual shareholders meeting that the drugstore giant is ""actively engaged in dialogue with the FTC."" He also reportedly said that Walgreens is still ""actively in discussions"" with Rite Aid to make the deal work.The Federal Trade Commission was apparently not convinced that Walgreens' plan to sell Rite Aid 865 stores to Fred's (FRED) is enough to for the deal pass antitrust muster, according to a Bloomberg report last week that cites people familiar with the matter.President Trump late Wednesday named Maureen Ohlhausen as acting FTC chairwoman, to replace current FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez when she steps down on Feb. 10. After that, there will be two empty seats on the five-person commission. A GOP-led FTC may be more amenable to a merger.But the positive news didn't actively excite investors.Walgreens edged down 0.9% to 81.27 in the stock market today. Rite Aid rose as high as 7.23 intraday, but closed down 1.7% to 6.78. CVS Health (CVS) dipped 0.2%. Fred's sank 2.6%.Assuming the deal hasn't received regulatory OK by Friday, many analysts expect the companies to extend the merger deadline again.Walgreens and Rite Aid had in October already extended the end date of their merger agreement from Oct. 27, 2016 to Jan. 27 of this year. Walgreens' $9-per-share-in-cash deal to acquire Rite Aid was first announced in October 2015.RELATED:Rite Aid Rises As Trump Names Acting FTC ChiefWalgreens Falls, Rite Aid Dives As FTC Reportedly Opposes Merger Offer

114,WBA,"X Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly mulling an entry into the pharmacy market, but the e-commerce giant may be less of a threat to established players than Wall Street fears, according to one equity analyst.Amazon's strength amid ongoing retail carnage is linked to innovations, such as its Prime Now home delivery service, that have made shopping either cheaper or more convenient for consumers.However, Amazon is unlikely to garner generic discounts greater than what CVS or Walgreens already offer, and Americans already enjoy mail-order drug delivery through the major pharmacy benefit managers, Mizuho Securities' Ann Hynes said in a note Wednesday.""Amazon certainly has the financial means to make the investment,"" Hynes wrote. ""The question we have is whether or not the investment would garner enough return on invested capital that Amazon typically enjoys and, for that matter, expects.""She added that Amazon would face a daunting task expanding its delivery service stateside to include drug sales. The retail pharmacy industry ""is significantly more regulated in the U.S. than in foreign markets, and we anticipate this would be a significant barrier to entry,"" she said.""We would be buyers of CVS and WBA on today's weakness,"" Hynes wrote.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, gave up 3.4% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. CVS Health (CVS) lost 3.2%, and Rite Aid (RAD) shed 2.9%. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) dipped 0.2%, and drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) fell 2.8%. Amazon slid 1.7% amid a broad market retreat as President Trump's string of crises weigh on investors.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's pharmacy ambitions, like its consumer electronics initiative, show the company continues to innovate. The Leaderboard stock is extended well above an 843.94 buy point.The rise of high-deductible plans, with consumers assuming more of their own health care costs, is seen as a catalyst for the online retail giant's pharmacy ambitions.Amazon has reportedly hired a general manager with the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market in view, but its entry into the business has not been finalized.""I think Amazon would introduce a lot of transparency to what drugs really cost,"" Stephen Buck — co-founder of GoodRx, a service for cost-conscious prescription-drug consumers — told CNBC, which first reported the news.Buck estimated Amazon could get $25 billion to $50 billion of the roughly $300 billion spent on prescription drugs in the U.S. a year.Amazon's Japanese site has expanded the Prime Now service to include drug sales. That could be a prelude to a similar U.S. move, because the retailer often tests new initiatives in foreign markets before rolling them out domestically, CNBC said.Amazon has toyed with the idea of an online retail pharmacy business before. It backed Drugstore.com's bid nearly two decades ago to take on brick-and-mortal rivals. That deal soon fizzled. Walgreens snapped up Drugstore.com in 2011 and eventually shut it down.RELATED:Here's One More Thing Amazon May Be Killing

115,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) CEO Stefano Pessina said he still backs a Rite Aid (RAD) takeover, but said it's up to the two drugstore giants' boards to decide whether to extend the deal past Friday's deadline.Walgreens and Rite Aid had planned to close their $9.4 billion, or $9-a-share, merger by Jan. 27. The Federal Trade Commission hasn't given its approval, following reports late last week that the FTC wasn't satisfied with Rite Aid's plan to sell 865 stores to smaller rival Fred's (FRED). Walgreens said it has not received any official notice from the FTC.President Trump will have a chance to name several commissioners to the FTC's five-member board, perhaps shaping the agency toward a merger-friendly deal. But that's an unknown, and would take weeks or months to transform the FTC into a GOP-led body.Pessina told Bloomberg in a Tuesday meeting that ""is a matter for the boards"" and that he ""cannot anticipate"" what they'll do.The drugstores did previously extend that deadline from Oct. 27 as they worked for FTC approval.IBD'S TAKE: Investors waiting for Trump to settle Walgreens-Rite Aid could look to how his administration is already moving other sectors. Cement, materials and building products firms resumed their advance Tuesday amid fresh talk of big infrastructure spending. Eagle Materials, Vulcan and Martin Marietta are among those in buy range or near buy points.Walgreens would likely have to pay a $325 million breakup fee if the deal collapses, though it could be as much as $650 million under certain conditions.Walgreens stock fell 0.4% to 81.23 on the stock market today, for a three-day drop of 2.7%.Rite Aid rose 0.7% to 6.95 after sinking intraday to 6.72. Rite Aid is still down 19% over the past three sessions. Evercore ISI said last week that Rite Aid shares could fall to 3.50 if there's no deal.Fred's, which would more than double its stores with the Rite Aid deal, advanced 0.9%. Fred's is off 6.3% in the last three sessions. Fred's spiked 81% on Dec. 20 on news of the Rite Aid deal but has given up more than half of that gain since then.RELATED:Walgreens Falls, Rite Aid Dives As FTC Reportedly Opposes Merger Offer

116,WBA,"Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) has expanded its grocery delivery business to fresh produce and set up online ordering through its voice-activated home speaker system, taking on Amazon.com (AMZN) on two new fronts.Google Express, the delivery business, will offer fresh produce initially in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Google Express has partnered for fresh produce with Costco (COST), Whole Foods (WFM), and other retailers. Google Express will compete with Amazon Fresh, FreshDirect, Safeway and Instacart. While Amazon Prime Now also has retail partners, Amazon Fresh has its own warehouses.Google Express annual membership costs $95. Amazon in October changed its fee structure. Amazon Fresh costs $14.99 monthly for Amazon Prime members, and a Prime membership costs $99 a year.Google has also added shopping support to its Google Home internet-connected speaker system, which competes with Amazon's Echo smart-speaker system. Products, however, will only be available from Google Express partners, which include retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY).Amazon has sold more than 8.2 million Echo home speakers, says Consumer Intelligence Research. Google-parent Alphabet launched its artificial-intelligence-supported home speaker system last fall, but it hasn't disclosed shipments. Both Amazon's Echo and Google Home are voice-activated.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and Fabrinet are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. ""Measuring up to Amazon in this category is going to be tough because Amazon has one system through which millions of products are available globally, whereas Google will have to sign up lots of retailers in every locality where it aims to have this service available,"" said Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, in a report.""However, when it comes to almost all of the other features, Google Assistant is capable of offering a vastly superior user performance than Amazon Alexa,"" he wrote. ""This is because the AI that powers Google Assistant is top of the class, while Alexa's is second rate at best.""Edison Investment estimates that Alphabet has sold 500,000 Google Home devices. Google Home sells for $139, about $50 less than the Echo.Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 847.27 on Friday, ending the day at 845.07, up 0.11%. It's in a buy zone from a breakout Wednesday at 843.94.Alphabet stock, which hit its high of 867 on Jan. 27, rose 0.52% Friday to 846.55. Like Amazon, it too is in a buy zone from its breakout last month at 839.10, as the FANG stocks in general have been doing well of late.Amazon and Alphabet are racing to add more features to the internet-connected home devices. Both Amazon and Google reportedly are working on technology that could turn their voice-activated home speaker systems into phones. It's not clear if telecom regulations would get in the way of Amazon's Echo or Google Home adding such features.Observers also speculate that Amazon's plans for paid search on its popular Echo devices could pose a threat to Google's core advertising business. At an advertising industry meeting on Jan. 19, a top Amazon executive signaled plans for paid search.Google was asked about voice-based search on its Q4 earnings call on Jan. 26. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said: ""We expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and, you know, trying to drive that ecosystem that way.""RELATED:Amazon Expected To Introduce Line Of Private-Label Intimate Apparel

The stock tumbled through its 50-day and 200-day lines.Fred's sank 3.5% to 15.59. Fred's shot up 81% to 20.19 on Dec. 20, when the Rite Aid store deal was announced, but has pulled back substantially since then.CVS Health (CVS) lost 2%.Rite Aid shares had shot up last week on a New York Post report that regulators were expected to OK the deal before President Obama left office.Rite Aid could fall to 3.50 or less if the Walgreens deal falls through, Evercore ISI said.But some analysts speculate that the GOP-led FTC under the Trump administration will be more favorable toward a Walgreens-Rite Aid deal. President Trump will have three seats to fill on the five-person board once FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez steps down on Feb. 10.The Walgreens-Rite Aid has a Jan. 27 expiration date.

That action will more than double Fred's footprint.Walgreens Boots Alliance climbed 2.1% to close at 84.43 on the stock market today after rising intraday to 85.26. Rite Aid jumped 3.4% to 8.60. Fred's initially rose but reversed to trade down 5% to 16.93.Kroger (KR) at one point had been in the running to buy some Rite Aid locations, but reportedly had wanted to close many of those sites and make them in-grocery locations. The FTC wanted stand-alone stores. Kroger shares dipped 0.4% to close at 33.07.IBD'S TAKE: Telecom companies could make a flurry of takeover deals during the Trump administration. In 2017, telecom M&A scenarios trump earnings outlooks.Separately, Walgreens and FedEx (FDX) announced a deal to offer FedEx pickup and drop-off at Walgreens locations. The service will begin at a few stores in the spring, but the plan is to expand to nearly 8,000 locations by the fall of 2018. The deal would expand FedEx delivery options and give e-commerce shoppers a reason to come into Walgreens.FedEx shares fell 0.4% to 189.24.

132,WBA,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

Walgreens first said that it would buy Rite Aid in October last year and has faced regulatory concerns since.The sale would more than double the size of Fred's, which currently operates 647 locations, and make the company the third largest U.S. drugstore chain, Fred's said in a release. Fred's said it expects the deal to close during the first half of next year if it is approved.Fred's shares spiked 81% higher on the announcement, but retreated 4.8% on Thursday.However, Fred's popped more than 6% in late trading to 20.61 after activist fund Alden Global Capital disclosed that it bought a further 5.533 million shares from Dec. 20-22, for a total stake of 9.275 million shares, or a 24.8%. RELATED:Walgreens Signals FTC OK For Rite Aid Deal Near; Stock Breaks Out

136,WBA,"Rite Aid (RAD) on Tuesday agreed to sell 865 stores to Fred's (FRED) for $950 million in cash to help ease antitrust concerns ahead of its merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).The sale could mean the pharmacies are closer to getting their $17.2 billion merger OK'd by the Federal Trade Commission. In October Walgreens extended the merger deadline to 2017 to gain regulatory approval.But it also means that Fred's would more than double its footprint and expand its geographical reach with the acquisition.Fred's shares jumped 81% to 20.19 in the stock market today.Rite Aid shares rose 5.4% to 8.61, hitting their highest level since October 2015, when the Walgreens deal was first announced.

Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

143,WBA,"Art instructor and mother of three Amy Frankson has cut back on her trips to Pavilions supermarket from three times a week to maybe three times a month. For the most part, her groceries — including perishables like eggs and milk — are now dropped off at her doorstep in green totes marked ""AmazonFresh.""Her household used to rack up about $300 in weekly supermarket receipts from Pavilions, a Safeway chain. Now Frankson's family spends about $200 a week on groceries, and buys an estimated 85% from the Amazon's fresh-grocery home-delivery service. There's also the convenience factor.""If I order it in the morning, it could be there by dinner time,"" she said from her home in Newport Beach, Calif.Shoppers like Frankson have Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and others scrambling to get ahead of Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce giant has swallowed up segment after segment of the retail business and spit out bookstores, electronics retailers and clothing chains along the way. Now Amazon hungers to pile groceries onto its plate.And millennials, who are finally starting to form their own households, could accelerate Amazon's push into refrigerators around the world.In fact, even as Amazon rolls out new shows on its streaming video service and new gadgets with artificial intelligence, some analysts believe everyday groceries could deliver the biggest boost to its revenue.Amazon shares have pulled back a bit after hitting new highs earlier this month but were up 0.1% at 744.86 Friday. The stock is up 10% so far for 2016, compared with the S&P 500's 6% year-to-date gain.Wal-Mart rose 3 cents to 73.55 on Friday, and Kroger edged up 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's earnings report next week could propel the stock even higher. Here is how investors could have approached Amazon's earlier run-up and why the lowest stock price isn't always the best.For now, Amazon controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen. Kroger's 9% market share puts it at a distant second, and Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.But when it comes to online grocery sales, Amazon is already No. 1, bagging a 22% share in 2015 vs. Wal-Mart's 13%.First tested in Seattle almost a decade ago, AmazonFresh has quietly popped up since then in about a dozen cities along the coasts. They include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and New York.A new offensive has brought Fresh back into public focus. The service recently launched in Boston and across the pond in London.An Amazon spokesperson said the company does not comment on its product roadmap.""We're branching out as fast as we can while being careful not to sacrifice the quality and convenience our customers expect from AmazonFresh,"" says Amazon's help page.To shop on AmazonFresh, customers have to sign up for Prime Fresh, a higher-tier Prime membership that costs $299 annually. At $200 more than a regular Prime subscription, the service isn't exactly cheap, but Frankson said it ""definitely pays for itself.""Gen Xers like Frankson and her husband, Brian Mackerer, both 42, are contributing to growing online-grocery penetration. According to a recent Cowen analysis, 16% of surveyed 35- to 44-year-olds used such a service in February. As for millennials, the firm found that 21% of 25- to 34-year-olds had bought groceries online, with 28% pegged as ""likely future buyers.""""Particularly with a younger generation, there's no desire to drive to a store and push a cart down an aisle and load heavy items and stand in line at checkout and then throw stuff in your trunk or in bags on the bus or whatever and take it home, when there are other more convenient options,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD.Fellow tech titan Alphabet, meanwhile, has taken a different route with its Google Express service, positioning itself as a courier between residents and nearby stores like Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), rather than a direct competitor.Google Express memberships cost $95 a year or $10 a month; nonmembers are charged $4.99 per delivery. It's available in a sprinkling of cities across the country. Cold grocery delivery is only featured in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Perhaps mercifully for legacy players with established supplier relationships and infrastructure, the complex fulfillment strategy associated with fresh food is slowing down Amazon's grocery takeover.Handling produce and perishables is a whole different animal at an Amazon fulfillment center. There are temperature checks, quality requirements and inspections, according to an MIT report cited in Cowen's analysis. Plus, just like at the supermarket, bags have to be packed with extra care to ensure that berries are not smashed and eggs aren't cracked.Why bother with a low-margin business that has difficult logistics?Because people go grocery shopping about four to five times a month, and the added operating income dollars outweigh the unattractive margins, say Blackledge and Chen. Plus, it lures shoppers into Amazon's Prime ecosystem.""For (Amazon), we think the purchase frequency fits well with the Prime value proposition and the incremental operating-income (dollars) offset the low-margin profile,"" they wrote, adding that Amazon will benefit from scale and logistics expertise, among other things.That should translate to billions more dollars at the top line. The Cowen analysts estimate the U.S. food and drink market is Amazon's ""biggest category for upside impact to revenue and/or"" gross merchandise volume. They see the company's grocery volume shooting up to $23.2 billion five years from now from an estimated $8.7 billion this year.Of the additional spending that goes to online food and beverage sales in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021, Blackledge and Chen think Amazon alone will capture 38% -- and that's a conservative forecast.Longtime food suppliers to grocery stores are expected to hop on board the Amazon train as shopping habits shift, margins be damned.""At this point, a lot of suppliers realize Amazon is absolutely a must — a channel they have to be on, even if it comes at the expense of their margins,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The amount of velocity and product sales you're going to get through Amazon, you absolutely have to be a partner in some way.""When it comes to online grocery shopping, traditional grocery bigwigs are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks, including partnerships with last-mile delivery services like Instacart or features such as in-store pickup.""It's very clear that all of those players are looking for a solution,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton. But which solution works best is still a mystery.Target (TGT) has been testing online grocery delivery in Minneapolis. Kroger shoppers can use ClickList to order online and pick up in a store, or Vitacost.com to order health foods and vitamins for home delivery. Wal-Mart offers curbside delivery pickup in dozens of markets, and has plans to expand.Of the major players, market leader Wal-Mart ""appears to be the farthest along with future-proofing, in our view, with online grocery pickup up in 20 markets now and adding an additional 22 this year,"" according to the Cowen report. It noted that Wal-Mart sees online grocery pickup as a ""key growth strategy"" for its U.S. stores and online business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.At a Deutsche Bank consumer conference in mid-June, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs sounded bullish on the company's online grocery prospects, while noting that its shoppers may in fact prefer in-store pickup over home delivery.""(Customers) like — while they're out — being able to come pick up their groceries,"" he said. ""So it's an area that will evolve a lot. We think we have a good competitive position where we're at, and I think it'll be a big part of our future.""Costco, on the other hand, doesn't care for the ""order online, pick up in store"" model. Instacart and Google Express enable home delivery of certain perishables and other items, but Costco mostly wants customers to pay its warehouses a visit.""We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during the company's Q2 earnings call in March. ""Maybe that would change if we were having minus-3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.""Whole Foods Market (WFM) has taken its relationship with Instacart up a notch. The specialty grocer announced in March that it would roll out in several new markets over the next year, in addition to the 17 metro areas that it already serves.But for Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and the like, AmazonFresh isn't the only worry.Meal-kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver pre-measured ingredients along with a recipe, are a ""fast-growing market"" and an ""incremental headwind"" to the specialty grocery space, according to Naughton. He said 25% of people who say they shop primarily at specialty grocery stores have tried home-delivery meal kits.Indeed, Frankson said Blue Apron is ""eroding"" what is left of her family's need for Pavilions. She has also tried snack subscription box Graze, but said she was ""not crazy about all the snacks and they just piled up.""Amazon has its nose in that, too. Tyson Foods (TSN) will debut a meal-kit delivery service, Tyson Taste Makers, in partnership with AmazonFresh later this year.But for some people — and some foods — the in-store experience will continue to be essential.A Nielsen global study found that 61% of poll respondents think going to a supermarket is ""enjoyable and engaging,"" and 57% believe the act of grocery shopping is ""a fun day out for the family.""Plus, people get picky about their produce.""There's still an element of consumers wanting to touch and feel what they're buying,"" said Hottovy. ""I think that's still the biggest hurdle for them in becoming a major disruptive player.""Frankson, however, is ""very happy"" with AmazonFresh's produce.""They don't give me dodgy-looking avocados,"" she said.

144,WBA,"Yahoo (YHOO) said certain information involving ""at least 500 million user accounts"" was stolen in late 2014 by what it said was likely a ""state-sponsored actor.""That followed reports that Yahoo could soon reveal a major data breach involving some 200 million Yahoo accounts.Yahoo said in a statement: ""The account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The ongoing investigation suggests that stolen information did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data, or bank account information; payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system that the investigation has found to be affected.""Yahoo said it's working with law enforcement, stressing that it had no evidence that the hackers are still in its system.Yahoo urged users to change security questions and to update their passwords if they haven't done so since 2014.It's unclear if the data breach disclosure will have significantly major regulatory and legal implications for the $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo's core business to Verizon Communications (VZ). Verizon said it was notified in the last two days.A hacker had claimed over the summer to be selling credentials for some 200 million Yahoo accounts. If press accounts are true, Yahoo users would be asked to change passwords, but it's not clear what other steps Yahoo would have to take.Yahoo rose 1 cent to 44.15 on the stock market today.Yahoo's $42 billion market cap is largely due to its holdings in Alibaba (BABA) and Yahoo Japan. Alibaba shares rose 3.2% to 109.38, hitting its best levels since the end of 2014, fueled by a price target hike from Stifel Nicolaus.Meanwhile, homebuilder Lennar (LEN) said it will buy smaller rival WCI Communities (WCIC) for $643 million, or $23.50 in cash and stock.Lennar rose 0.35% to 43.60. WCI Communities shot up 38% to 23.67 -- slightly higher than Lennar's offer price.On Tuesday, Lennar topped earnings views Tuesday but orders and margins were weak. Shares hit their lowest in more than six months intraday Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Lennar stock on Wednesday fell to its worst levels since March 1. It's ranked 17th in the Building-Residential/Commercial group, which is rated 189 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks. But a handful of housing stocks are acting well. See who the real leaders are at IBD Stock Checkup.AutoZone (AZO) earned $14.30 a share in its fiscal Q4, up from $12.75 a year earlier and 5 cents above Wall Street views.

AutoZone did announce a $750 million buyback.AutoZone fell 0.4% to 746.23.Rite Aid (RAD) earned 3 cents a share excluding various items, in line with views. Sales climbed nearly 5% to $8.03 billion, but analysts expected $8.17 billion. Same-store sales fell 2.5%, as new generic drugs hit pharmacy sales. Rite Aid, the No. 3 drug chain, is being acquired by No. 1 Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). Walgreens and Rite Aid are still working with regulators on approval.Rite Aid rose 0.25% to 8.12 as Walgreens climbed 2.2% to 82.38.RELATED:Walgreens Signals FTC OK For Rite Aid Deal Near; Stock Breaks OutYahoo Stock Rises On Alibaba Stake; Is Tax-Efficient Deal Doable?

146,WBA,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) stock popped Wednesday after it got its second Wall Street upgrade this week.Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger lifted his rating to overweight from equal weight, saying that management's plans to renegotiate its debt covenants and sell its non-core assets should offset the company's risks. Risinger admitted that those risks are many, but he said they're already priced into the stock.""Although Valeant stock has been highly controversial, the company sells compelling products which are in demand, including key franchises such as Bausch & Lomb and dermatology,"" Risinger wrote.Risinger actually forecasts the second half of the year at the low end of management's guidance, which Valeant affirmed in its earnings report last week. But he sees potential upside in the launch of psoriasis drug brodalumab, which was endorsed by an FDA advisory panel last month as it awaits approval, and in improving sales from Valeant's gastrointestinal drugs and Walgreens (WBA) partnership.On the downside, there are those investigations Valeant is under for its past activities, and the fact that the new management will have to execute well to meet its numbers, he wrote.Morgan Stanley's move follows Mizuho's upgrade to neutral on Monday, as a Valeant bear admitted that the debt negotiations in particular looked likely to torpedo her short thesis.Valeant stock shot up 12.8% to 30 on the stock market today, a two-month high.IBD'S TAKE: Down 89% from its high, Valeant is cheap now, but in IBD's research the great stocks often aren't ""bargains.""

147,WBA,"Amazon.com (AMZN) isn't attending the annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., but its presence was arguably felt in one way or another Tuesday morning.With holiday retail figures out — some tremendously disappointing to investors, others less so — and Amazon crowned the clear winner of Christmas by Slice Intelligence, the conference presents an opportunity to reflect on a modern shopping landscape pockmarked by growing online sales and subdued mall traffic.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) management said it was ""relatively happy"" with its real estate portfolio, calling it ""pretty healthy"" and noting that it doesn't feel particularly hurt by Macy's (M) recent announcement to close dozens of locations, despite having stores in those same areas.But an outperforming digital channel could prompt store closures anyway.""We're looking at things like digital penetration to brick-and-mortar sales within that region,"" said one executive at the conference. ""You know, if a store's in a C-mall location, for instance, and although we're still making money (but) we're seeing digital having a much higher penetration — you know, we might decide to close that store. ""He then said that the company ""will definitely see a decrease in our U.S.-based real estate portfolio over the ongoing years, particularly as traffic gets more challenged in some of the C(-mall) locations.""American Eagle shares were up 1.7% at 15.22 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.15%.Separately, Lululemon (LULU) CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC following his presentation that the upscale yogawear maker is being targeted in its approach.""When you think about traffic, we're not going after every bit of traffic; we're really focused on getting highly qualified traffic,"" said Potdevin on CNBC. ""If you'd been in our stores during the holiday season, they were really, really busy. And our conversion was outstanding, both in-store and online.""What about Amazon moving in on the apparel space with activewear of its own?""When you have more competitors, you have a bigger market, and it's an opportunity,"" said Potdevin in response. ""I'd rather have more competitors than no competitors. . . It really validates the strength of the market.""Lululemon shares rallied 3% to 70.26 as they work on a cup-with-handle base with a 72.80 buy point.And then there's beauty, which has thus far been a market that's shown relative immunity to Amazon's appetite for brick-and-mortar retailers' business.For e.l.f. beauty (ELF) — which began as an e-commerce business — part of that advantage comes in the form of speed-to-market. It takes the low-cost makeup company as little as 20 weeks to bring a product to market, while larger, slower-moving players can take up to two years to launch product, according to e.l.f. executives at the conference.""We've been able to grow regardless of economic cycle,"" said e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin.E.l.f. is carried in retailers like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS). With only a handful of stand-alone stores, it is expanding its reach via in-store partnerships with existing retail heavyweights.""We see Ulta (ULTA) and Walgreens (WBA) as natural partners and expect a possible announcement in the next 60-90 days,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink following the presentation.""The company's trend identification, development speed, and commitment to newness are both averaging up the gross margin and driving working capital utility, but are also setting the brand apart at retail from a merchandising, messaging, and engagement perspective.""Shares of e.l.f. were down 1.6% at 28.60, near the low of a flat base with a 32.64 entry.
"
148,WBA,"Mylan (MYL) made a fortune, and stirred controversy, while getting EpiPen allergy shots stocked in schools across America.Now the drugmaker wants to sell EpiPens to restaurants, sports venues and potentially even Boy Scout troops — by setting up its own pharmacy to cut out middlemen and by lobbying for new laws that could expand sales of its biggest product.The plan, obtained by Bloomberg News through public records requests, would bypass small-town pharmacists and chains like CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) and let Mylan sell the drug directly to public places. The company is looking to revitalize EpiPen sales that began slumping last summer, when Congress questioned Mylan over EpiPen's sixfold price increase since 2007.""It's extremely smart,"" said Mark Baum, founder and chief executive of San Diego-based Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY), which supplies drugs directly to patients. ""There's no rationale for other middlemen getting in the way. That's just driving up the cost to customers.""Sales of EpiPens fell in the third quarter as the $600 price tag sparked a furor that included questioning of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch by a congressional committee. Since mid-August, shares have fallen about 20%. Last month, Mylan said it would cut fewer than 10% of its employees.Mylan declined requests for interviews with executives, but Bresch has made no secret of its strategy to push for state laws to allow so-called entity prescriptions — drugs sold to places rather than people.""We are continuing to open up new markets, new access with public entity legislation that would allow restaurants and hotels and really anywhere you are congregating, there should be access to an EpiPen,"" Bresch said at a September 2015 conference.In October, Mylan said it reached a $465 million settlement with the U.S. government over accusations that it overcharged the Medicaid program by classifying the EpiPen as generic, instead of a brand-name drug, in order to pay lower discounts.Mylan's new business plan could revolutionize an industry whose layers of middlemen, critics say, cost customers money. The country's more than 600,000 eating and drinking establishments, plus thousands more sports venues, amusement parks and movie theaters, could be a gold mine for Mylan.More than 15 million Americans have food allergies, and a severe reaction sends a patient to the emergency room about every three minutes, according to Food Allergy Research & Education.In 2015, EpiPens brought in $912 million with an operating profit of $498 million, Mylan said in a regulatory filing. If half of America's restaurants bought an EpiPen two-pack each year at a full price of $608, Mylan would generate about $180 million more in annual sales. Last month, the company began selling an authorized generic two-pack for $300.EpiPens, which deliver shots of epinephrine that can stop severe reactions to bee stings and food such as peanuts and shellfish, have been provided free to 67,000 U.S. schools, Mylan said. Schools can also buy additional EpiPens at a discount.Laws in 48 states allow schools to stock and administer epinephrine injectors. Mylan spent about $4 million in 2012 and 2013 to help get federal legislation passed to encourage states to stock the devices in schools, according to lobbying disclosure forms filed with the U.S. House of Representatives.Now the company is trying to replicate that campaign. Since 2013, Mylan has funneled thousands in campaign contributions to state lawmakers, according to campaign finance disclosures and documents posted on Mylan's website.Already, at least 30 states permit entity prescriptions beyond schools. Before Mylan's involvement, no states had enacted such legislation, the company website says.Ohio State Representative Christina Hagan, who sponsored a bill there, received a $1,000 donation from Mylan last year. Hagan said working as a waitress taught her the gravity of food allergies.The Republican said she was unaware of Mylan's campaign contribution. The bill was unanimously approved.Frank Minear, owner of Frank's Family Restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, said he plans to buy an EpiPen because he has shellfish and items containing peanuts on the menu.While most severe allergic reactions happen at home, 6% occur at restaurants, according to a 2014 study.""I look forward to being one of the first restaurants in Stark County to supply the EpiPen in case it's needed,"" Minear said. ""It's a lifesaving thing.""Mylan said its pharmacy, Mylan Health Management, would be used to distribute EpiPens only to entities and not to individuals, according to the company's pharmacy license applications obtained by Bloomberg News. Mylan first disclosed the existence of the unit in a securities filing last year, without providing any details, and Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, reported on it in October. The pharmacy was created for ""future opportunities"" and isn't operating, Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email.Prescriptions to restaurants and other entities would likely be cash purchases, so Mylan wouldn't have to pay rebates to drug-benefit managers, like it does for prescriptions covered by insurance.And with its own pharmacy, Mylan could keep the entity prescriptions from migrating to cheaper generic competitors that might emerge in the future. Its website describes a new ""Mylan On Location"" program to help businesses ""offer immediate care in emergency situations.""Mylan might save $40 to $55 in pharmacy and distributor fees on each $600 EpiPen prescription, according to Michael Rea, CEO of Overland Park, Kansas-based Rx Savings Solutions.By cutting out middlemen, Mylan ""can offer an EpiPen for $200 or $250, give the market a $350 discount, and make the exact same profit,"" Rea said.Mylan's approach could backfire, said George Sillup, chairman of pharmaceutical and health care marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Someone without proper training ""could inflict some harm or injury,"" he said.Training requirements vary by state. The American Red Cross offers a 30-minute online course for $20.Pharmacist Brad Arthur, who owns two drugstores in Buffalo, N.Y., and is a past president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said he would applaud the program despite its threat to his livelihood.""It's this kind of disruption in the pharmaceutical pricing model that we're ripe for,"" Arthur said.

149,WBA,"Prospects for the $17 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) acquisition of Rite Aid (RAD) may have improved as Walgreens holds talks with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal.Walgreens is already auctioning off stores in areas with high volumes of Walgreens and Rite Aid stores, according to a report from the New York Post.Walgreens shares fell 1.5% to 82.51 at the close on the stock market today. Rite Aid shares gained 2.4% to 7.19. Rite Aid had hit a post-deal announcement low on Tuesday.The talks could be a sign that the FTC is looking more favorably on the deal, which has been in doubt as federal regulators have stopped some major mergers recently, including the Staples (SPLS)- Office Depot (ODP) deal.Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) also scrapped its purchase of Baker Hughes (BHI) over regulatory concerns.If the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger is approved, the new company would top CVS Health (CVS) as the largest drugstore chain in the U.S. CVS dipped 0.4% intraday.Walgreens announced in October that it would buy Rite Aid for $9 per share.

152,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) is doubling down on its name by offering more health-conscious food and drinks to its CVS Pharmacy stores as consumers continue to gravitate toward natural and organic foods.After starting out with a 500-store pilot program last year, the company plans to add 100 more stores per week to the rollout until 2,900 stores nationwide are stocked with healthful foods by the end of the year.Customers can expect about a quarter of the impulse buy area by the checkout counters to carry Kind bars, Larabars and Vega One bars instead of candy and chocolate. Paleo-, raw- and vegan-friendly foods like grass-fed bison bars and seaweed will be featured in separate displays in coming months.Popular brands being added to the mix at CVS include Amy's Kitchen, Annie's Homegrown, Chobani, Vita CoCo, Bai, Krave Jerky, Rhythm Superfoods and That's It bars, said the company. It also will have new offerings from its house brand that is free of artificial ingredients, Gold Emblem Abound.The move is part of a strategy toward offering healthier products. CVS stopped selling tobacco products in 2014. Also that year, it changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.CVS shares ticked down 2 cents to 93.21 by the closing bell on the stock market today. Peers Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) moved little, with Rite Aid unchanged at 7.74 and Walgreens up 0.3% to 83.20.The move comes as shoppers clamor for better-for-you fare, and as online players like Amazon (AMZN) pressure traditional retailers.Amazon's continued push into the consumables and food and beverage market are seen as two out of three ""key drivers"" of its core business, according to a Cowen analysis from March, with apparel being the third driver. Amazon is also expanding its private-label brand.Amazon ticked up 0.3% at the close to 715.82.RELATED:Amazon Looks Primed To Disrupt Wal-Mart, Target, CVS, Walgreens.

153,WBA,"Embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) shares shot up Tuesday after it affirmed its full-year guidance, even though it missed Q2 estimates.The guidance, which calls for revenue of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion and EBITDA of $4.8 billion to $4.95 billion, was important not just as a signal of the company's financial health, but also because if Valeant lowered its EBITDA guidance any further it would be in danger of violating its debt covenants.The company, however, missed Q2 expectations, with sales shrinking 11%. It blamed a slow recovery in its dermatology products, which took the biggest hit from the shutdown of Valeant's specialty-pharmacy partner Philidor and has been struggling to get re-established in the company's new partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Also, gross profit margins suffered from higher R&D expenses, which Valeant said was due to spending on the (ultimately positive) FDA advisory panel on psoriasis drug brodalumab on July 20.In its investor presentation Tuesday, Valeant said that it had restored net profitability to its dermatology prescriptions as of last Friday, and it expects the second half of the year to be seasonally stronger than the first. In a separate announcement, the company said it was selling North American rights to rare-disease drug Ruconest to Pharming for $60 million upfront and up to $65 million in milestone payments, as part of Valeant's strategy of selling off non-core assets. The company estimates the total value of these non-core assets at about $8 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant's stock is currently low-rated, but investors who played it right made a lot of money on it in the recent past. Check out IBD's video CAN SLIM Case Study: Valeant Pharmaceuticals.Valeant stock leapt more than 25% by the close to 28.16 on the stock market today, hitting a two-month high. The stock also rose Monday despite a general downturn in drug stocks when Valeant announced changes to its management team, including heads of its new three-part structure: Bausch & Lomb, branded pharmaceuticals and diversified U.S. products.  The company also hired a new general counsel and business-strategy chief and announced the departure of its heads of investor relations and European operations, without naming replacements.On the downside, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted the continuing struggle of gastrointestinal drug Xifaxan, which Valeant acquired along with Salix Pharmaceuticals after the latter company had been caught overstuffing its inventory. The inventory drawdown is complete, but sales are still flagging, Raffat said.""Xifaxan is the single biggest surprise amidst everything that has happened -- few months after Salix acquisition, consensus had Xifaxan at $1.5 billion-plus run rate for 2016 … compared to $800 million run rate it's at,"" Raffat wrote in a research note.

156,WBA,"The rate of inflation remains below 2%, but you wouldn't know that looking at rising health care costs. Health insurance premiums, in particular, are seeing dramatic increases. What can the average person do to cut costs and get the best coverage for the least amount of money?The best and most obvious solution is to stay healthy. Take better care of yourself through preventive care. Evaluate your lifestyle, what you eat, drink and do. Most people overlook this, but the more you invest in your health by making smart choices through nutrition and exercise, the less you will need health care services now and in the future. Keeping your body in good shape will end up saving you dollars.But no matter how healthy you are, you still need health insurance — and affordability is a real issue. If you don't have health insurance, the first thing to do is enroll in ObamaCare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Even though ObamaCare faces an uncertain future under the new president, if you're enrolled before any legislative changes, at least you will be grandfathered into the program.On ObamaCare your premiums are capped as a percentage of your income. If your household income is one to four times the federal poverty level (FPL) of $11,800 for an individual and $23,400 for a family of four, you may be eligible for a premium tax credit. In 2017, 400% the FPL for an individual will be $47,520 and $97,200 for a family of four.The best way to save money on your health insurance coverage is to get it through an employer. But if you have to get coverage as an individual, you are constrained by the options available in your state. When you evaluate plans, premiums and copays are offsets. That is, the more you pay in premiums, the less you pay in copays. The less you pay in premiums, the more you pay in copays.""If you're young, take the lower premium and the higher copay,"" said Chris Orestis, the chief executive officer of Life Care Funding, a national company based in Portland, Maine, that works with families to help them pay for long-term care services, and the author of ""A Survival Guide to Aging."" ""If you're older or you have a family and you anticipate going to a doctor regularly, you should pay a higher premium because you want a lower copay if you're a regular consumer of health care services.""But even people who get their coverage through their jobs are seeing their deductibles and copays rising. Some even find insurance companies saying that instead of asking patients to pay $20 to go to the doctor, they now need to pay 20% of the bill.""There are limited things you can do,"" said Paul Fronstin, the director of health research for the Employees Benefit Research Institute. ""Sometimes you have to weigh whether to skip a service. Ask more questions. Is this service really needed? Is this drug really needed? Are there coupons for this drug? Coupons are a big thing.""Fronstin suggests if you have a large deductible, you can try to negotiate with a doctor. He may give a discount if you pay cash.""If you have a $3,000 deductible and you owe the doctor $1,000, she may write some of it off,"" said Fronstin. ""It depends on the doctor. Ask the doctor to waive a facility fee. Don't be shy. You might not get it, but it doesn't hurt to ask.""Fronstin also suggests asking if certain procedures, such as an endoscopy, might be cheaper in an outpatient facility than in a hospital.""None of this is necessarily easy, but there are options."" he said. ""The possibilities exist.""Laurie Kamhi, managing director and partner of LCK Wealth Management in New York, notes that people in high-deductible health plans can save for qualified medical expenses on a tax-free basis in health savings accounts. These are similar to the flexible spending accounts offered by companies in that money is saved on a pretax basis. The big difference is the money doesn't have to be spent each year. It can be accumulated to pay for health care costs years in the future.Kamhi also says people need to be aware that some health insurers are now restricting consumers' choice of pharmacies to cut costs and will not reimburse you if you buy from certain retailers or prescription mail-order services. In September, a network owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans gave Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA) the contract it previously had with CVS Health (CVS).RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

165,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) sank to a more than two-year low Tuesday after the drugstore giant and pharmacy-benefit manager cut full-year and 2017 EPS guidance, saying it expected to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions next year amid tougher competition.CVS Health cut its full-year 2016 EPS target to $5.77-$5.83 from $5.81-$5.89. Analysts had expected $5.85.In cutting 2016 guidance, company said that ""very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter."" It added that ""slowing prescription growth"" and a ""soft seasonal business"" were also hurting.Those network changes, CVS said, had ""more significant implications"" for 2017, and the company said it expects retail operating profit growth to decrease. CVS sees 2017 EPS at $5.77-$5.93, far below analyst targets for $6.53.The forecast comes as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tries to lure pharmacy-benefit managers away from CVS with better prices. The landscape could become more difficult if Walgreens and Rite-Aid (RAD) merge.For this year's third quarter, earnings per share rose 28% to $1.64, topping views for $1.57. Revenue climbed 15.5% to $44.6 billion, missing estimates for $45.29 billion.

166,WBA,"Stocks fell mildly in the first hour of trading Friday, setting up what is likely to be another grim week for equities following news of weaker-than-expected April payrolls growth in the U.S. and more pessimism on the earnings picture for the rest of the year.A few names in the generic drug and pharmacy industries sold off sharply on dark full-year profit forecasts, but nursing and physician staffing firm AMN Healthcare Services (AHS), No. 2 in the IBD 50, soared to a new high after posting robust results.The S&P 500 was off less than 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite fell more than 0.4%. The S&P 500 is trying to remain above its rising 50-day moving average, which would indicate a healthy uptrend, but the large-cap index has been saddled with as many as seven distribution days over the past 25 trading sessions. Distribution days, or significant declines of 0.2% or more in heavier volume than the prior session, signal intense professional selling.The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average April 29 and has failed to quickly rally back the critical support line, a negative sign. It also scores a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD, indicating increased selling among institutional players such as mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and pensions. You can track this rating for the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow by clicking on the link to a separate chart page, found at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column.Endo International (ENDP), a maker of both branded and generic medicines, plunged more than 36% to 16.85 in huge trade after reporting an 8% drop in first-quarter profit despite a 35% jump in revenue to $963.5 million. It was the first year-over-year EPS drop in five quarters. Endo cut full-year guidance due to strong competition from its rivals in the generic drug space. The poor action parallels the deep sell-off in AmeriSourceBergen (ABC) after the drug distributor noted earlier this week tough pressure on generic drug costs.Endo stock had been showing poor action since diving below its 200-day moving average on Aug. 20 last year and failing to rebound. That decline broke a long-term uptrend in the stock. Endo scores a lowest-possible 1 Relative Strength Rating from IBD out of a maximum 99, as well as a 32 Composite Rating.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) dropped in sympathy, falling more than 3% to 78.89 in strong turnover. The pharmacy chain announced on Thursday that affiliates of the private equity firm KKR (KKR) plan a secondary offering of 15 million shares.On the upside, AMN rose more than 7% and hit a new high of 38.91 in heavy volume. The company on Thursday chalked up a 100% jump in Q1 profit to 60 cents a share, 20% above Wall Street's consensus view, as revenue jumped 43% to $468 million. The company has now achieved 40%-plus revenue gains for a fourth straight quarter.

167,WBA,"Amazon (AMZN) has solidified its position as an e-commerce leader, and its global takeover may happen sooner than you think.A Cowen & Co. report out Wednesday forecasts Amazon displacing Macy’s (M) as the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer by 2017, driven by selection, fulfillment and brand relationships. Amazon’s momentum in apparel is also seen leading to retailer mergers and acquisitions, as well as store closures.Cowen also projects that Amazon will displace Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) to become the No.2 company in consumables, behind Wal-Mart (WMT), by 2018. The report calculates a compound annual growth rate of 27% for the e-commerce giant’s consumables market.Meanwhile, Social Capital has set a very bullish $3 trillion, 10-year valuation on the stock, with the venture capital firm citing strength across retail and its Amazon Web Services segment. Amazon’s current market cap is about $314 billion, while Apple -- the most valuable public company -- has about a $515 billion market cap.IBD's take: How does Amazon stack up vs. its peers? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAfter gapping up on its strong earnings report last week, shares are now extended 9% from a cup-with-handle buy point initially cleared in mid-April. The stock is trading about 5% below its all-time high reached at the end of last year, and it closed down 1.8% Thursday.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart recently plunged below its 50-day line and has yet to retake that level, as it ended virtually flat.

168,WBA,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) rose sharply and fellow specialty drugmaker Perrigo’s (PRGO) fell Friday on reports that the former is about to hire away the latter's CEO.Late Thursday, the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources saying that Valeant is hiring Joseph Papa if it can get Perrigo's board to void a noncompete clause in his contract. On Friday morning, Perrigo issued a brief statement saying that it would not comment on ""speculation,"" which is the only official word from either company so far.Valeant has been hunting for a new CEO since March 21, when activist investor William Ackman moved to the board and tried to order the company's growing chaos. The stock lost more than 80% of its value since a scandal related to a pharmacy partner broke last September, forcing Valeant to strike a new distribution deal with Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) that was accompanied by across-the-board price cuts. A disastrous Q4 report and guidance cut, along with an internal investigation that accused former CFO and current board member Howard Schiller of misconduct, eventually turned even bullish analysts against Valeant's management.Papa, meanwhile, has run Perrigo for 10 years and has a largely successful track record. Under his watch, the company's revenue has more than tripled, the stock has climbed eightfold, an inversion deal moved headquarters to low-tax Dublin, and Mylan (MYL) attempted a hostile takeover that Perrigo successfully fought off.IBD Take: Perrigo was once a hot stock, but not lately. Learn why in IBD Stock CheckupPerrigo's once-steady profit growth has gotten uneven in the last couple of years, however, and the stock has declined more than 40% since its Mylan-induced high last April. It currently holds a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 40.This change has led some analysts to worry about the implications of Papa's departure for Perrigo.""Papa has become the face of Perrigo during his long tenure as CEO,"" wrote Jefferies analyst David Steinberg in a research note. ""However, with the exception of CFO Judy Brown, the company’s other executives -- including John Hendrickson, who was appointed President in Oct. 2015 -- are largely unfamiliar to the investment community.""Further, the timing couldn’t have been more inopportune. Mr. Papa is potentially departing prior to the announcement of Q1 results, and this follows a string of difficult quarterly financials -- particularly in the company’s flagship consumer business.""Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen agreed, noting that Perrigo is widely expected to miss Q1 estimates and lower its guidance. ""There has been debate about senior management change at Perrigo, but we don't think the Street was thinking that it would actually happen or be this soon,"" Chen wrote.Perrigo stock was down 5.8% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 121, after hitting its lowest level intraday since August 2013. Valeant stock was up 7.7%, near 36.

169,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) missed second-quarter revenue views but raised full-year earnings guidance Tuesday, after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) takeover target Rite Aid (RAD) in June noted reimbursement-rate pressure at its pharmacies.Estimate: EPS of $1.30, up 7%, on a 19% revenue gain to $44.28 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS $1.32 on revenue of $43.7 billion.Outlook: Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.55-$1.58 vs. consensus for $1.55.

Walgreens Boots Alliance edged down to 78.94, while Rite Aid was unchanged at 7.01.IBD'S TAKE: CVS is more likely to face a larger rival as prospects for the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger deal improve. Walgreens held talks last month with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal.In June, Rite Aid reported a break-even quarter, below analyst estimates for earnings of 5 cents a share and prior-year EPS of 2 cents. Revenue rose 23% to $8.18 billion, short of views for $8.26 billion.""Our challenge was pharmacy reimbursement rate pressure, which we were unable to offset, largely due to drug-purchasing efficiencies that did not meet our expectations,"" said CEO John Standley in a statement.Rite Aid also attributed a decline in adjusted EBITDA to ""lower pharmacy margin due to lower reimbursement rates that were not offset by purchasing efficiencies and script count growth.""Meanwhile, CVS has been adding health-conscious food and drinks to its CVS Pharmacy stores as consumers continue to gravitate toward natural and organic foods.

Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

176,WBA,"Rite Aid's (RAD) fourth-quarter adjusted earnings topped Wall Street forecasts by a penny, but revenue fell short of expectations. Shares didn't budge much Thursday, as the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain remains in the process of being acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Profit fell 42% to 7 cents a share, as revenue grew 21% to $8.27 billion. Analysts had expected 6 cents in per-share earnings on $8.4 billion.Same-store sales dipped 0.6% in Q4, which includes declines of 0.8% in pharmacy sales and 0.4% in front-end sales.The Rite Aid-Walgreens deal, announced last October at $9 per share, is still expected to close in the latter half of the calendar year. Due to the merger, Rite Aid did not offer 2017 guidance.Rite Aid shares closed down 0.5% in the stock market today. Walgreens dropped 2.9%. The stock remains in a broad area of consolidation, briefly taking then losing support at its 200-day line at the start of April. Shares remain above the 50-day.On Tuesday, Walgreens topped second-quarter earnings estimates and bumped up the bottom end of guidance, but revenue fell short of analyst expectations.Rival CVS Health (CVS) finished 2.4% lower Thursday.Image provided by Shutterstock.

177,WBA,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) late Tuesday released its long-awaited 10-Q filing with the SEC, after shares fell to a 6-year low in the regular session on the drugmaker's weak earnings and guidance.The embattled drugmaker needed to file its 10-Q report to avoid triggering debt default conditions.Before the market open, Valeant admitted that its bad press over the last year has hurt more than just its image.New CEO Joseph Papa said that Valeant's distribution deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which his predecessor said got off to a rocky start this year, was continuing to drain money. Some products covered under the deal, mostly dermatological, were going for a negative average selling price (ASP) -- as Papa put it, ""we're taping dollar bills on that prescription as it goes out the door.""The difficulty has been mainly in getting reimbursement -- something that used to be the specialty of Philidor, the pharmacy that previously handled the same products but that shut down last year after a scandal erupted around its relationship to Valeant. The deal with Walgreens was made to replace it, but the scandal is having lingering effects among Valeant's customers.""Negative external attention continues to adversely impact the business and our reputation with patients, physicians and all of you, our shareholders, as well as our distracted organization,"" Papa said.Management also pointed to the disruption as causing the underperformance of Xifaxan, the bowel-disease drug whose prescriptions rose 32% year over year but still missed both the company's and Wall Street's expectations.Overall, Q1 earnings fell 38% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.27 a share, missing analysts' consensus by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $2.37 billion, slightly below estimates.Valeant shaved a full $1 billion off its full-year sales guidance, now $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. Its EPS guidance dropped by $1.55 at the midpoint, to $6.60 to $7. Last year, the company made $10.16 a share on $10.4 billion in sales.Valeant's EBITDA guidance was $4.8 billion to $4.95 billion, not only down from previous guidance but barely above what's required in its debt maintenance covenants. Valeant, which ran up a great deal of debt with its voracious acquisition strategy over the last few years, has recently received more than one default notice due to its late filings of financial reports as it cleaned up after the Philidor scandal.Though executives said on the call that this will not be a problem, more than one analyst expressed concern on the point. Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem wrote that the troubles with derm products and Xifaxan added up to a bad outlook.""That backdrop, along with management conceding that the distractions in the organization and the damage to the company's reputation have had a real impact on results, lead us to wonder if there is further risk to the revised 2016 guidance,"" Amsellem wrote in his research note. ""That in turn leads us to conclude that Valeant still could run afoul of its financial maintenance covenants on its debt. We are reinstating a price target of $19 and are reiterating our Underweight rating.""Valeant stock dropped as low as 22.52 on the stock market today, its lowest point since mid-2010. Shares closed Tuesday at 24.64, down 15%. Shares were little changed in initial extended trading following the 10-Q filing.For S&P Global analyst Jeffrey Loo, this represents a buying opportunity, as the stock is still below his price target even after he cut it in half based on the results.""We see more volatility as Valeant works to stabilize its business and repair relationships with vendors and insurers,"" Loo wrote as he reiterated his buy rating. ""We continue to believe Valeant's assets are attractive and operations should stabilize by year-end.""

178,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose fractionally Monday morning after announcing that it is cutting ties with troubled blood-testing firm Theranos.Walgreens, in a late Sunday statement, said it is ending their three-year partnership and will shut all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers in Walgreens locations. Walgreens halted using Theranos lab testing services at its Palo Alto, Calif., location in January amid growing allegations that Theranos' claims did not hold up.“In light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has rejected Theranos’ plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers’ best interests to terminate our partnership,” said Brad Fluegel, Walgreens Senior Vice President and Chief Health Care Commercial Market Development Officer.Walgreens stock climbed 2.3% to 84.36 by the closing bell on the stock market today.Multiple regulatory and health agencies are investigating Theranos over the accuracy of its blood tests. Theranos has claimed it could run a battery of tests with just a few drops of blood, making it cheaper and less-painful than tests from Quest Diagnostics (DGX) and Laboratory Corp. of America (LH).The Theranos Wellness Centers were the largest source of revenue for the company.Theranos released the following statement Monday morning:""Quality and safety are our top priorities and we are working closely with government officials to ensure that we not only comply with all federal regulations but exceed them. We are disappointed that Walgreens has chosen to terminate our relationship and remain fully committed to our mission to provide patients access to affordable health information and look forward to continuing to serve customers in Arizona and California through our independent retail locations.""

179,WBA,"Despite Brexit-inspired global growth woes that pushed bond yields to record lows, stocks rose, helped by a strong jobs report. Breakouts were more common. Tesla Motors (TSLA) held up amid negative headlines. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) bet big on oil, but crude prices promptly suffered heavy losses. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other carriers face stiff headwinds.The major averages were up and down for most of the week, but moved higher after Friday's strong jobs report. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week, settling Friday just 1 point below a record close and 5 points from an all-time best. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9%. General Electric (GE), Facebook (FB), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Pepsi (PEP) were among the notable breakouts. Apple (AAPL) retook its 50-day moving average. Health food stocks soared after Danone agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV).The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low but closed above those levels Friday.The U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs in June, far more the 180,000 economists expected. It was a sharp bounceback from May, which saw its meager gain of 38,000 revised down to just 11,000. The jobless rate rose to 4.9%, reflecting a jump in the labor force.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 144,000. That, along with the upward trend in wage gains, might have been enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.Minutes from the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, when policymakers kept rates steady, revealed concern over the June 23 Brexit vote and the sharp slowdown in U.S. job gains in May. But there remained divisions over the labor market's general health, inflation trends and the outlook for economic growth.Tesla Motors said car deliveries fell well below its forecast for the second quarter. The 14,370 vehicles delivered fell short of its guidance of 17,000, due to ""the extreme production ramp in Q2 and the high mix of customer-ordered vehicles still on trucks and ships at the end of the quarter."" But production fell short of Tesla's estimates as well.It was the second quarter in a row that Tesla has missed its own delivery targets, and it comes as Tesla has made a much-criticized bid to acquire SolarCity (SCTY). A key objection to a SolarCity deal is that it could distract Tesla from ramping up vehicle production.Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary evaluation into the performance of the Autopilot feature in the Model S, following a recent fatal crash. The NHTSA confirmed it will also investigate the recent nonfatal crash of a Tesla Model X ""to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.""Tesla shares rose 0.1% fractionally for the week, just between its 50-day and 200-day lines, which crossed in bearish fashion during the week.Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their partners said they would invest $36.8 billion to expand the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan. Main operator Chevron and its partners have already spent $37 billion on the project. The report comes after BP (BP) said it would spend $8 billion to build another liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia. Energy giants had cut spending as crude prices fell but the new investments could be a sign that companies are confident about the price rebound after a rally in 2015 failed.But did oil majors bet at just the wrong time? Crude prices have tumbled this week amid global growth concerns, a stronger dollar and higher-than-expected U.S. inventories. U.S. crude fell 7.1% to $45.41 a barrel, its biggest weekly drop since February. Brent futures sank 7.1% to $46.76 a barrel, its sharpest loss since January.Samsung Electronics posted its biggest Q2 sales gain in more than two years, helped by strong demand for its Galaxy S7 handsets. Samsung is benefiting from weaker-than-expected demand for Apple's iPhone 6S handsets. Apple's next smartphone, the iPhone 7, likely will be released in September, but it isn't expected to be much different than the 6S. Apple moved sideways during the week, but the stock closed above its falling 50-day line on Thursday.Meanwhile, BlackBerry (BBRY) said it's ending production of its iconic BlackBerry Classic mobile phones.Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) were among the health-focused food companies that got a lift after French dairy products maker Danone (DANOY) agreed Thursday to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) -- the owner of Silk soy milk and brands that include Horizon Organic -- in a $10 billion deal. The proposed merger highlights the trend among consumers toward healthier fare. On Thursday, WhiteWave rose 19%, Hain Celestial climbed 7% and Amplify rose 2%. For the week they rose 20%, 6% and 9%, respectively.Delta Air Lines forecast Q2 operating margin and a unit revenue decline that were worse than it had anticipated in April. The carrier also said fuel costs were far higher than expected. Unit revenue declines for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) might not level off until the end of 2017, Credit Suisse said, while earnings could also come in below consensus for that year. Among the reasons cited for the darker forecast are higher fuel costs, labor deals, Brexit and an unfavorable foreign exchange environment.Southwest Airlines (LUV) traffic rose 6.8% in June, more than the 5.4% capacity increase.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said June traffic rose 10.9%, outpaced by an 11.7% capacity increase. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said June traffic rose 11%, while load factor edged up to 94%.Delta, American, United, Southwest and Alaska Air rose modestly for the week, while Ryanair fell somewhat, but well off its lows.Comcast (CMCSA) soon will offer direct access to Netflix (NFLX) for subscribers with its broadband-based X1 set-top box. The nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator previously refused to allow third-party, over-the-top internet video services on its set-top boxes, for competitive reasons. The arrangement is seen as a win-win for both firms. The deal bolsters Comcast's broadband service and reduces the risk of cord-cutting, while providing an easy on-ramp to Netflix service for new and existing customers.Costco said June sales increased 3% to $11.33 billion, while sales for the 44 weeks ended July 3 rose 2% to $96.33 billion. Shares climbed 5% Thursday in heavy volume, breaking past a 158.89 buy point from a double-bottom base with a handle.Pepsi also broke out Thursday, rising 1.5% to clear a 107.04 flat-base buy point in heavy trade. The packaged-food and beverage giant said quarterly earnings increased 2% to $1.35 a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales fell 3.3% to $15.4 billion, but were above forecasts.Costco rose 1.1% to 165.44 on Friday while Pepsi climbed 0.7% to 108.27.The drugstore chain topped Q3 profit views by 4 cents with 16% growth to $1.18 per share, but revenue gains of 2% to $29.5 billion missed analyst estimates for $29.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 3.7%. International retail pharmacy sales fell 2.3% but rose 3.4% ex currency. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) raised the lower end of full-year guidance by a dime to $4.45-$4.55, vs. views for $4.49. But shares lost 1.5% for the week, below their 200-day line but rebounding from their 50-day line.
"
180,WBA,"Action in the U.S. stock market turned ugly Friday, as the indexes headed toward the session's final half hour. But big dividend plays such as AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and utilities were bucking the decline.The Nasdaq lopped off 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.If the bulls had any notion that the Nasdaq would climb above long-term upside resistance at 5,000, the idea was dashed with the tech-leaning index's gap down at the open and deepening losses in the afternoon.Shelter from the selling was scarce. Only 6 of IBD's 197 industry groups managed a gain. Retail-Drug Stores led, but this was mostly on reports that the government would approve the merger of  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD). Walgreens shot up 4.2% while Rite Aid added 3.2%.Dividend stocks appeared to be doing better than less conservative plays. AT&T headed toward its 12th gain in 13 sessions. The stock rose 0.15 to 40.24 in volume 20% above average. The annualized dividend yield is 4.8%.Verizon Communications is climbing the right side of a potential base. The stock advanced 0.55 to 52.50. Verizon's dividend yield is 4.4%.New York utility Consolidated Edison (ED) popped 0.23 to 76.77 in average volume. Con Ed is trying to clear a double-bottom base. The dividend yield is 3.5%.In the IBD 50, every stock was down, though some were bobbing over and under the break-even line.News seemingly affecting the stock market included: nervousness surrounding Britain's potential exit from the European Union; the British vote on the issue June 23; the Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday; and a slight miss in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey.
"
181,WBA,"Apprehension that Britons will vote to secede from the European Union is exerting influence great and small in disparate corners of the U.S. equity market. Here's a map to where.A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper published late Monday showed ""Leave"" at 44% and 42% for ""Remain,"" while a survey by ORB for the Daily Telegraph had ""Remain"" at 53% and ""Leave"" at 46% once ""don't knows"" were stripped out. JPMorgan published a list last month of stocks with the highest sensitivity to the Brexit outcome, and that group has been trailing the market of late.The 22 stocks on the list, which encompasses companies from PPL Corp. (PPL) to Invesco (IVZ), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and PRA Health (PRAH) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.""U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions"" because they ""tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K."" Lakos-Bujas wrote. ""We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals.""Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. ""The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region,"" she wrote in a note to clients last week. ""It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure.""Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is ""poor,"" Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ford Motor (F), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, Barclays (BCS) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.
"
182,WBA,"Stocks opened lower Thursday, pressured by mixed early economic news, weak oil prices and selling in overseas markets.The Nasdaq fell 1%, dropping below its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow industrials fell 0.9%. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled to 1.52% below August flash crash intraday lows to the lowest levels since 2012.Merck (MRK), Ctrip.com (CTRP), American Airlines (AAL), Kroger (KR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC) were among the early movers in the stock market today.Consumer price growth slowed to 0.2% in May, the Labor Department reported, representing half of April's 0.4% pace and just below consensus forecasts for a 0.3% rise. Core prices, minus energy and food, also rose 0.2% -- surprising estimates for a 0.2% decline.First-time unemployment claims also picked up, rising to 277,000 in the week ended June 11. Consensus views expected an uptick to 270,000 from the prior week's 264,000 claims.The U.S. trade deficit for the first quarter was $124.7 billion, the Commerce Department estimated. That would be down from what department officials originally projected was the prior quarter's gap of $125.3 billion. But the department on Thursday also narrowed that fourth-quarter figure to $113.4 billion, thus resulting in an increase in the gap.Manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region improved in June, lifting the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey to a reading of 4.7,  its first positive reading after two months of contraction.The National Association of Home Builders reports its June builders' confidence index at 10 a.m ET.Drugmaker Merck rose 1.2%. The company announced that a clinical trial of its Keytruda lung-cancer treatment showed the drug outperforming chemotherapy. Merck ended Wednesday's session back below a 57.50 buy point in a test of support at its 50-day moving average.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 0.5%.China-based hotel reservations and travel booking site Ctrip.com rose less than 1% after jumping 3% soon after the open. First-quarter earnings growth easily topped analyst expectations, and a 73% revenue gain stomped forecasts. The stock had fallen out of a seven-week basing effort and ended Wednesday below key levels of support.Grocery chain Kroger rose nearly 3% after a solid first-quarter report.Smith & Wesson initially rose 1% as momentum appeared to be gathering along several fronts for a possible tightening of restrictions on firearms purchases, But shares faded to fractionally lower. The gunmaker is scheduled to report its fiscal-fourth-quarter results after today's close.Crude slumped nearly 2%, with West Texas Intermediate trading just above $47 a barrel and down about 4% for the week. Gold bumped up 2% to $1,314 an ounce. The dollar was down sharply against the yen but up vs. the euro. The 10-year Treasury yield eased 1 basis point to 1.56%.In a tough day for markets across Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 careened 3.1% lower -- its sixth drop of more than 3% since April 1. The Bank of Japan surprised markets by voting to hold its policy unchanged and not expand its economic and monetary stimulus measures. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 2.1%. The Shanghai composite slipped 0.5%.Europe's markets deepened their early losses in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX led the declines, down 1.3%.
"
183,WBA,"A major expansion by Amazon.com (AMZN) into private-label goods, which could come this month, elevates its ability to further challenge legacy retailers across the board.Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates Amazon will be the No. 2 player in the $425 billion consumable market, excluding food and beverage, surpassing Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT) but still lagging well behind market leader Wal-Mart (WMT).He defines consumables as four segments: personal care products, household products, baby products and pet products.Blackledge also estimates Amazon will be a top-10 player in the $785 billion food and beverage grocery market by 2019.“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption, given younger demos increasingly purchasing grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote.The leader in the food and beverage category is Wal-Mart, followed by Kroger (KR), Albertsons/Safeway and Costco Wholesale (COST).Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying Amazon is set in the coming weeks to roll out new lines of private-label brands that will include its first broad push into perishable foods.According to the Private Label Manufacturers Association, sales of private-label store brands in the U.S. topped $118 billion in 2015, with supermarkets and drug chains accounting for over $70 billion of the total.In the grocery and consumables market, Blackledge says, Amazon’s growth has come at the expense of Wal-Mart, Target. Walgreens and CVS. Amazon’s key competitive advantage is its multiplatform approach with Amazon Prime, which includes same-day delivery for many goods, “all of which should lead to rising number of consumers skipping the trip to the local supercenter, drug store or grocery market,” he wrote.Amazon has sold private-label products since 2009, primarily under the AmazonBasics brand, though that effort has concentrated largely on consumer electronics.Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 702.80 in the stock market today. Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 722.45 on May 12. It carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94, putting it among the top 6% of all stocks on key metrics such as revenue growth.Walgreens climbed 1.3% but CVS fell 1.5%. Target climbed 2.4%. Wal-Mart advanced 1%, hitting a nine-month high intraday, after spiking nearly 10% Thursday on strong earnings and same-store sales.
"
184,WBA,"Stocks rallied modestly after Janet Yellen signaled that a June rate hike was off the table and oil prices rose above $50 a barrel, but those gains reversed. Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces new safety concerns, but shares still rose on hopes that it will meet production targets. Apple (AAPL) revamped its App Store business model. Amazon.com (AMZN) doubled down on India. American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers rose despite mixed news. Niche retailers Lululemon (LULU) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY) reported strong earnings.Stocks rallied much of the week on no-hike hopes. The S&P 500 rose to a 10-month high, less than 1% below an all-time best. The Nasdaq approached 5,000 for the first time this year, while the Dow topped 18,000. Shares pulled back slightly on Thursday and especially Friday as bond yields hit or neared record lows around the world and Brexit fears revived. The S&P 500 closed the week down 0.1% and the Nasdaq 1%. The Dow industrials eked out a 0.3% gain.Days after a dismal May jobs report, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economy is making progress. But she dropped a hint in late May that a hike would be appropriate in the ""coming months."" Yellen's comments, along with cautious statements from other policymakers, signaled a June 14-15 meeting move is off the table.The CME FedWatch Tool now sees a 2% chance of a move next week, a 20% chance in late July and 35% in September. In fact, the odds don't favor a move until the December meeting (55%). Before the May jobs report, investors saw a 30% chance of a June move and 60%-plus by July.Meanwhile, April job openings rose by 118,000 to 5.788 million, matching a record high reached last July. But the number of actual hires fell by 198,000 to 5.092 million, the lowest since last August.

Beauty spending rose 20% from last year among more affluent teens, the firm said, with growth in all areas: makeup, skin care and fragrance.Wissink specifically called out Ulta's rewards program as a successful lure for return customers.""From surveys of both women and teens, the single common thread is that beauty spending is rising, and the shift to specialty and (e-commerce) formats is accelerating,"" wrote Wissink in a separate note on Ulta. ""Ulta's loyalty program is a key asset, driving frequency and reinforcing a growing content library to inspire brand discovery, test & trial, and basket value.""The company's Ultamate Rewards program now has over 18 million members, with over 80% of sales coming from those customers.Shares of Ulta were up 1.7% in the stock market today.

When this S&P 500 sector is expected to show earnings growth leadership in 2016, why is it lagging in the stock market?Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) is up 2% year to date through April 1. By comparison, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) jumped 16% in the same period.Yet in the recently concluded reporting season, the consumer discretionary sector posted an impressive 11.53% earnings-per-share growth over the year-ago quarter -- ahead of all S&P 500 sectors except telecommunications services.""This (discrepancy) may partly reflect the sector's outperformance in 2015,"" Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in a recent note.Indeed, that strong showing factored into Miracle Mile Advisors' decision to get out of the sector in the middle of 2015.After a strong run, consumer discretionary and retail stocks had looked fairly valued, said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at the Los Angeles firm, which manages roughly $500 million.Miracle Mile also expected defensively oriented sectors to hold up better if the market pulled back. The decision to tilt towards utilities and consumer staples paid off in 2016's volatile first quarter.XLY has rebounded nicely amid a broad stock rally in the last month, rising 4.4%. However, Feldman's still cautious about consumer discretionary and retail stock ETFs.""We're not looking to enter until it gets a little bit cheaper,"" said Feldman. ""It's a valuations call.""However, both recent economic data and recent policy moves are supportive of domestically oriented sectors, such as retail. These include job gains, emerging signs of wage growth and a Fed that's in no hurry to raise interest rates.""Consumers have money in their pockets to spend"" when mortgage and auto loan rates are low, said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research.And in an earnings recession, the consumer discretionary sector is holding up fairly well. It's expected to see a 1.4% EPS decline in first-quarter earnings and a 2.5% decline in first-quarter revenues -- better than most S&P 500 sectors and subsectors, according to Zacks estimates.""The only concern I have is that consumers have not really been spending, despite low gas prices,"" Mishra added. What Americans have been willing to spend on is leisure and entertainment activities. That helps to explain the wide dispersion in the consumer discretionary sector.For example, Market Vectors Gaming (BJK) and SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) are up 7% year to date. XRT invests in companies that own and operate big-box general merchandise, drug, grocery, department, automotive, apparel, and specialty retail stores.Besides Walgreens and Rite Aid, XRT's 98 equal-weighted stock holdings include highly rated IBD stocks such as parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), discount retail store Five Below (FIVE) and beauty chain Ulta Beauty (ULTA). This ETF has a smaller-cap skew than XLY.Investors seeking to invest in this sector should look for stock holdings that benefit from rising consumer trends, such as online shopping and home improvement, Mishra advised.The two largest stock holdings in XLY and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR) are Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD). Amazon and Home Depot have soared 62% and 21% in the past year, respectively.Miracle Mile managers are more likely to invest in XLY than XRT when they decide to dive back into the consumer discretionary sector.""We tend to go towards more household, blue-chip names,"" Feldman said.

224,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD), which are working toward becoming one, are both on tap to report earnings in the upcoming week.Walgreens has logged a string of double-digit earnings and revenue gains for the last four quarters, following the late-2014 completion of the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The drugstore giant then announced in October that it would acquire smaller rival Rite Aid at $9 per share in cash for a total valuation of $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt.The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, which is still expected to close in the latter half of calendar 2016, was ""progressing as planned"" as of Walgreens' last quarterly report in January. Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin, however, recently expressed doubt that the merger would get the regulatory OK.When Walgreens reports on Tuesday morning, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate an 8.5% profit rise to $1.28 per share. Revenue is seen growing over 15% to $30.66 billion.In mid-March, Walgreens and OptumRx, a unit of insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH), announced a pharmacy benefit partnership, allowing the drugstore's pharmacies to better compete with CVS Health (CVS) on services and cost savings. CVS is a drugstore-pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) hybrid.Walgreens shares fell 0.45% in the stock market today. Shares have been in a broad period of consolidation, trading below their 200-day line since early November and finding support at their 50-day moving average in early March.Rite Aid, which has around 4,600 locations, reports early Thursday but will not be holding a conference call, due to the pending merger. Earnings are expected to tumble 50% to 6 cents a share on a nearly 23% sales climb to $8.4 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday.CVS shares retreated 0.3%. The stock recently found support at the key 200-day level in mid-March and set a 5-month high on Friday.RELATED:Walgreens-OptumRx Alliance Hits Express Scripts StockWalgreens-Rite Aid Deal: ‘Even More Doubt’ That Regulators Will OK.

225,WBA,"The outgoing CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) received a subpoena from the Senate on Monday to testify at a hearing on drug pricing, in the wake of new accusations of price-gouging from its former buyout target.The Senate Committee on Aging subpoenaed J. Michael Pearson to appear at a hearing on April 27, which will be the third in a series of such hearings investigating sharp increases in drug prices. Valeant has been a popular target for Congress on this issue; former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month, defending Valeant's massive price increases on heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel. Last year, House Democrats also asked for documentation on the subject.The subpoena followed Friday's news that shareholders of Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which Valeant acquired last year for $1 billion, sent a letter to Valeant accusing it of overpricing Sprout's female-arousal drug Addyi, which they say sank its chances on the market.""Valeant predatorily priced Addyi at $800 a month even though Sprout had established a price point of approximately $400 a month for the drug based on market research,” the letter said, according to Bloomberg. “As a result of this predatory pricing, insurance companies refused to cover the drug, which has led to the drug not being affordable for millions of women.""The shareholders asked for documentation that Valeant was honoring the promises that it made to market the drug, as part of its buyout agreement.Valeant stock was down 7% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 29.While Valeant has become the poster child for aggressive drug pricing, the issue may already be becoming obsolete for the company, given the changes going on. Its 2016 guidance drastically missed expectations this month, partly because it stopped the drug hikes and agreed to a broad 10% price cut on the many drugs covered under its distribution agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). Pearson has also said that the company is no longer looking for ""underpriced assets"" and in fact won't be doing any acquisitions in the near future.A week later, Valeant said it's looking to replace Pearson, and is also trying to oust Schiller from the board, in a general overhaul of the business.

226,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will use UnitedHealth (UNH) OptumRx for its pharmacy benefit needs, which could save companies and consumers billions.The pact likely negates the need for Walgreens making an expensive purchase of a large pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) like Express Scripts (ESRX), as some on Wall Street had speculated. Express Scripts shares fell 3.5% to 67.61 after falling as low as 65.97, near a 52-week low.Walgreens' agreement with UnitedHealth OptumRx will give it the ability to provide similar services and cost savings as arch-rival CVS Health (CVS), a combined drugstore and PBM.The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association separately launched an ad campaign Thursday touting savings from PBMs. The trade group said in a statement that PBMs, which negotiate prices and other terms between pharmacies and drugmakers/distributors, are projected to save employers, unions, government programs and consumers a combined $654 billion on drug benefit costs over the next decade.Currently the No. 2 drugstore chain by revenue, Walgreens is buying No. 3 Rite Aid (RAD), which has its own PBM, for an estimated $17.2 billion. If that deal goes through, Walgreens could choose to expand use of that PBM for the combined company.Walgreens said in a statement that the UnitedHealth OptumRx agreement includes a 90-day prescription option at Walgreens' nearly 8,200 pharmacies in the U.S., OptumRx home delivery, and 24/7 access to pharmacists.The drugstore company plans to integrate OptumRx's pharmacy care services with Walgreens' current drugstore services. The agreement will go into effect starting on Jan. 1, 2017.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates nearly 13,000 locations in 11 countries, rose 1.5% to 83.30 in the stock market today. Walgreens stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for more than five months, with a 97.40 buy point. It's risen 16% from the 71.50 low point of the trough.Shares of CVS, which have also been in a more-than-five-month first-stage consolidation, were up 0.1% Thursday.

244,WBA,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) suffered their biggest one-day drop ever Tuesday, down 51% in late-afternoon trading, after the specialty drug maker's Q4 earnings and guidance delivered another blow to investors' battered confidence.Valeant reported adjusted earnings of $2.50 a share, 11 cents short of the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue of $2.79 billion beat consensus by about $40 million.The results were preliminary and unaudited because of an ongoing review of the company's current and past financial reporting after a scandal broke out last fall, delaying the filing of the 10-K annual report. In its statements Tuesday, Valeant said its failure to file by March 15 put it ""in breach of the reporting covenant in the indentures, and the trustee or holders of at least 25% of any series of notes may deliver a notice of default."" It then has 60 days from the receipt of the default notice to file the form.Valeant didn't provide year-over-year comparisons because 2014 financials are still under review, but it previously reported Q4 2014 earnings of $2.58 a share on revenue of $2.28 billion, so on that basis EPS fell 3% and sales rose 22%.Valeant slashed its guidance for the current quarter. It now expects revenue of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, more than $500 million below its previous guidance, with EPS guidance down about $1 to a range of $1.30 to $1.55.For the year, Valeant hacked more than $1 billion off its sales guidance, now $11 billion to $11.2 billion, with the EPS range down more than $3 at $9.50 to $10.50. To make things more complicated, it also said it's changing the way it's reporting its tax rate, which means that reported EPS will be a dollar lower than that. The actual taxes paid won't change, however.There were multiple reasons for the shortfall, many to do with the messy transition of the company's business model in the wake of the scandal. Valeant had severed its relationship with now-defunct specialty pharmacy Philidor after a number of allegations were lodged against it.In December, Valeant announced a new partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to distribute the dermatology and ophthalmology drugs previously channeled mostly through Philidor, but Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson admitted on the company's earnings conference call with analysts that the deal hadn't been well received, and Valeant has made unspecified changes after complaints from distributors.Pearson said Valeant has also been negotiating with payers over the pricing and rebating of drugs, which also contributed to the reduced guidance.Valeant has been the target of criticism all the way up to Congress over its historic price increases, but the Walgreens deal brought with it a 10% price cut across the board. Pearson said Valeant's price increases this year are among the lowest in the industry, as it's tried to accommodate payers.Pearson said the impact of most of these efforts is being felt in Q1, and that ""we in essence lost a quarter."" For that reason, Valeant gave guidance for the 12 months starting April 1, which it says is more representative of its business going forward.Valeant expects EPS of $10.75 to $11.25 for the period, which is still below Wall Street's average estimate of $15.02. It forecast revenue of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion, which has no point of comparison, since there isn't a consensus revenue number for Q1 2017.Some more fundamental problems than the transition became apparent.Pearson said the guidance accounts for a slower-than-expected rebound in the dermatology business after the loss of Philidor, as well as slower growth in ophthalmology and the Solta and Obagi aesthetics units.The European business is also flagging and suffering from foreign-exchange headwinds. At the same time, costs haven't come down in line with the revenue slowdown, though Pearson said the company will work to address that.Some analysts were clearly growing impatient with Valeant's management, as the guidance was just the latest piece of bad news in a cavalcade that has driven the stock down some 85% since early August. Valeant had given more bullish 2016 guidance last year that it reaffirmed as recently as mid-January, but it withdrew that last week as it postponed the Q4 report while Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave.""The ever-shifting commentary from Valeant surrounding a number of segments in our view suggests that management simply does not have a handle on the health of its own business,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem in a research note downgrading the stock to underweight from neutral.Amsellem also expressed concern about Valeant's high level of debt, which has piled up after years of a voracious acquisition strategy that has swollen revenue 10-fold since 2009. On the call, Pearson reversed course and said that this year Valeant will be divesting noncore assets rather than acquiring them, and that reducing debt is a top priority.However, the late 10-K filing could come back to bite the company's credit. Under Valeant's bank credit agreement, if the company fails to file by March 30 it will go into default and have only 30 days to resolve it by filing, thus making its deadline even tighter than that of the reporting covenant. Pearson said the company will try to file in April, but ""can't commit to that.""""While we believe that it is highly likely that the banks will provide a waiver, uncertainty about the potential for a default creates enormous investor fear,"" wrote William Ackman, whose Pershing Square hedge fund is one of Valeant's largest investors, in a letter to clients Tuesday.Ackman noted that Pershing Square Vice Chairman Steve Fraidin joined Valeant's board last week, and ""we are going to take a much more proactive role at the company to protect and maximize the value of our investment.""

""Our content is highly valued by consumers, by physicians, and also highly ranked by the search engines, and we don't believe that situation is going to change.""Although it may eventually choose to merge with a deep-pocketed company such as longtime marketing partner Walgreens, the fact that WebMD isn't seeking a merger should come as no surprise. The company's finances seem fit as a fiddle without the aid of a larger partner.When the New York-based entity reported a 67% jump in fourth-quarter earnings per share to 60 cents on Feb. 23, it kept alive a string of strong reports in which WebMD posted quarterly profit growth of at least 39% for the last three years. At times that growth has gone as high as 600%.Also in the quarter, sales grew 18% to $192.13 million from advertisements on 3.97 billion page views, up 7% year over year. Both earnings and sales topped analyst projections.WebMD's 2015 revenue of $636 million was nearly three times that of the next-largest publicly traded health site operator, Everyday Health (EVDY), which operates its namesake site and several others. Another rival is Time's (TIME) Health.com. WebMD also competes with nonprofits like the Mayo Clinic, which takes paid ads, and the American Heart Association, which doesn't.The health advertising market in general is large and growing, and there are glimmers of optimism, even in negative news. Schonfeld & Associates last year forecast that the global pharmaceutical industry will cut advertising spending by 1.7% in 2016 amid consolidation and growing emphasis on affordable health care. Still, spending will top $21 billion, the market research firm said.WebMD is taking advantage of that, as well as an uptick in new drug approvals. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved 45 new drugs in the U.S., significantly more than the 28 the agency averaged in 9 of the last 10 years, officials say.""There is a historically strong pipeline of new drugs coming to market, a 40-year high,"" Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker told IBD. ""The Food and Drug Administration has been accelerating drug approvals, establishing the fast-track program and speeding the process for breakthrough therapies. And all of those new drugs need ads.""Perhaps best known for its flagship consumer-oriented WebMD site, the company operates a variety of other health-related sites that have enriched its coffers. In fact, one contributes more to the top line than even WebMD, and that is Medscape.A resource for physicians and other health professionals, Medscape has accounted for 60% of the company's total ad revenue each of the last three years. It's a free one-time registration site that provides personalized medical information and education tools to doctors and other health professionals. WebMD says its Medscape Journal of Medicine is the Internet’s first primary-source medical journal.""Drugmakers want to reach both physicians and consumers. But they want to reach physicians more, and they will pay more to do so,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Steven Wardell.Wardell expects Medscape will continue to contribute more to total revenue than WebMD. In the fourth quarter, Medscape averaged 7.3 million physician sessions a month, a 9% increase over the same quarter a year earlier. Other WebMD sites include MedicineNet, eMedicine, drug info site RxList and theheart.org.Figures indicate there's room for growth as drug ad spending is skewed toward old school media such as print magazines and newspapers.Leerink's research shows that just 4% of consumers reach for print media for health news, but the print industry gets 18% of health ad revenue. Meanwhile, 48% of consumers get health info from digital media, but just 31% of ad revenue goes there.""I would call this one of the best macro trends available to investors because pharmaceutical companies will re-index spending to where the audience is -- to digital spending,"" Wardell said.WebMD also is pushing deeper into video health presentations, which could further boost ad sales. Currently, WebMD is launching more than a dozen new video series that range from short, social-friendly episodes like ""how to's"" to in-depth features hosted by well-known TV journalists.Schlanger admits there are hurdles.""Starting in the third quarter of 2015, we began to experience a decline in the rate of growth of our overall traffic, which has continued into the current quarter,"" he said on the conference call. ""We are working to understand the reasons for this change.""Leerink's Wardell said he's not concerned about the slowdown in growth of overall page views because the highly-focused Medscape site for physicians generates the bulk of the company's revenue, and it's growing at a rapid clip.Keybanc Capital's Hooker agrees.""I think the decline in page views (growth) is misleading,"" he said. ""WebMD Health is ultimately a platform for drug ads. And there is a massive flow of new products coming into the market.""

248,WBA,"McKesson (MCK) on Thursday said it would buy oncology services companies Vantage Oncology and Biologics in deals valued at a total of $1.2 billion, expanding the drug distributor's reach in services for cancer patients.The deals are expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be funded by cash and debt, the company said. The two companies would join McKesson's Specialty Health division and are expected to add around 11 cents to adjusted EPS next year.""Collectively, these acquisitions will increase McKesson’s specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale, oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, solutions for manufacturers and payers, and scope of community-based oncology and practice management services available to providers and patients,"" McKesson said in a statement.Shares finished 0.45% higher in the stock market today.Vantage, which provides radiation and medical oncology, would bring more than 50 U.S. cancer centers under McKesson's umbrella, the drug distributor said.Biologics, an oncology pharmacy services company, ""will extend McKesson’s oncology expertise across the continuum of care for patients, allowing the company to engage its manufacturer partners in new ways and to enhance its value proposition to providers, patients and payers.""The acquisitions come after McKesson cut its 2016 earnings-per-share guidance last month partly due to weak generic-drug prices.Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) planned purchase of Rite-Aid (RAD) could also threaten McKesson's distribution deal with the latter of those two drugstore chains.Walgreens rose 0.6%. Rite-Aid added 0.1%.

263,WBA,"McKessson (MCK) announced up to $330 million in costs for restructuring, including layoffs, amid a consolidation wave led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS).McKesson said in a regulatory filing Friday that its restructuring will result in a $300 million to $330 million charge this year, mostly for severance and employee-related costs. The company expects the cost alignment to save about $170 million-$190 million in the coming fiscal year starting April 1, and about $70 million-$80 million the following year.The Dallas Morning News said Wednesday that McKesson will lay off approximately 1,600 people, or 4% of its workforce, as it consolidates offices in Irving, Texas. Earlier this month, McKesson also agreed to buy Canadian drug store operator Rexall for $1.9 billion.In January, McKesson cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook and sees next year’s EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""Last year, Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance.Other upcoming headwinds include the end of a contract with UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx health-services unit and the transitions of contracts with Ommicare and Target's (TGT) pharmacy business, which were bought by CVS.McKesson stock had been a steady performer for years, reaching an intraday high of 243.61 on May 19, 2015, before faltering.

264,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) on Tuesday said that a measure of growth in its pharmacy benefit clients' prescription-drug spending slowed to 5% last year from 11.8% in 2014.But ""(price) inflation in non-specialty brands outweighed all other trend drivers,"" the company said in a statement. Specialty drugs, as well as new launches and rising costs, ""had less impact than inflation of brands in high-volume categories such as drugs used to treat diabetes.""The announcement follows two years in which the price of specialty drugs has been under increased scrutiny.""The double-digit drug trend increases we were experiencing in 2014 resulted in a call to action from our clients to help them ensure their plan members could access the medications they need to stay healthy, at an affordable price,"" CVS Health Executive Vice President Jonathan Roberts said.CVS shares finished 0.7% lower in the stock market today. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 0.1% and Rite Aid (RAD), which Walgreens is buying, eased 0.1%.In 2014, the price of specialty drugs, exemplified by the near six-digit treatment price of hepatitis drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD), became a lightning rod for criticism. Pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS and Express Scripts (ESRX) have since negotiated discounts from drugmakers in exchange for coverage.In 2015, the lightning rod became the practice of some companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals, which bought obscure drugs on the cheap and hiked their prices.CVS has tried to curb usage of Valeant's Jublia, a toenail fungus drug that reportedly has a retail price of around $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle. On Monday, according to Bloomberg, CVS said it would launch an optional program in April intended to steer patients toward cheaper treatments.CVS clients' spending on Jublia soared 950% last year, Bloomberg said, adding that Express Scripts said it would also try to bring down the price of toenail fungus treatments.Gilead Sciences shares dipped 0.8%, Express Scripts closed down 0.6%, and Valeant climbed 4.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

265,WBA,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""

267,WBA,"CVS Health (CVS) posted Q3 earnings that fell short of views for the first time in more than a year and gave light guidance for 2016, just days after the drugstore operator's key rivals Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) announced plans to merge.CVS reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 a share, up 11.5% from a year earlier and below forecasts for $1.29 a share. It was the first time the company missed on earnings since the first quarter of 2014. Net revenue rose 10.3% to $38.6 billion, ahead of forecasts for $37.9 billion.CVS also sees 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.68-$5.88 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a profit of $6.02 per share.The earnings report followed Walgreens' announcement on Tuesday that it will buy Rite Aid, creating a drugstore powerhouse and a mighty rival to CVS.CVS shares closed down 4.84 Friday in the stock market today. Walgreens shares closed up 0.95%, and Rite Aid ended flat.In Q3, CVS' same-store sales for its retail drugstores increased 1.7% vs. a year earlier. Pharmacy same store sales were up 4.6%, and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes were up 4.4% on a 30-day equivalent basis.CVS said sales at its drugstores were hurt by the introduction of low-margin generic drugs, lower reimbursement rates, and its move to stop selling tobacco products last year.Front-store same-store sales were negatively affected by softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size, it added.""Reimbursement pressure has not changed but ... Medicare and Medicaid are big areas of growth in this (pharmacy benefit management) business and they carry a lower margin rate,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on a conference call.Rising generic drug prices are hurting drugstore operators, as insurers and PBMs have been slow in raising reimbursement rates for those drugs, he added.

269,WBA,"Insiders at Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Bank of America (BAC) were among those who made notable trades disclosed this week.The transactions come as many of those companies contend with disappointing quarterly results, struggles with user engagement and broader fears of economic turmoil.A handful of Facebook's senior managers recently sold shares of the social media giant, according to SEC filings this week. Jan Koum, a director and founder of WhatsApp, disclosed the sale of 286,906 company shares.Last week, Koum disclosed the sale of almost 1.15 million shares for about $114.2 million. He agreed to sell WhatsApp to Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion and still holds more than 65 million Facebook shares.Koum recently expressed support for Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's resistance to a government order to assist the FBI in cracking the security software in an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass killing in December.Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer also disclosed the sale of 20,000 shares, while Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had sold 15,600 shares.Facebook shares ended the week up 2.5%.Bank of America Director Frank Bramble has bought 75,000 company shares, while the banking giant's stock has tumbled 28% since the start of the year amid growing fears of a recession.On Tuesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari also called for policymakers to consider breaking up big banks to avoid another government bailout.Shares of Bank of America added 1.5% for the week.Barry Rosenstein, a board member of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and a founder of hedge fund JANA Capital Partners, disclosed the sale of 1.72 million shares of the drugstore operator.After visiting with management recently, Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin wrote in a note this week that ""we have even more doubt that the merger with (Rite Aid (RAD)) will be approved.”Walgreens shares rose 0.6% vs. a week ago. Rite Aid gained 1.4%.Thomas Ryder, a member of e-commerce giant Amazon's board and a former CEO of the Reader's Digest Association, has sold 4,000 shares. Director William Gordon, a co-founder of Electronic Arts (EA), has sold 1,000 shares.Amazon's fourth-quarter results last month disappointed investors. But its cloud services stand to benefit as more tech firms adopt cloud-based infrastructures and, if nothing else, recent company moves suggested to some that it could be considering selling its own diapers.Amazon shares rallied 5.5% for the week.Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto disclosed the purchase of 15,500 company shares. Noto also disclosed purchases in November, August and May.The latest purchase comes as the company's share price has suffered amid struggles to draw more users. Twitter also recently announced plans to incorporate tweets based on relevance into users' timelines.Twitter shares surged 15.3%.LinkedIn (LNKD) Chief Financial Officer Steve Sordello has sold 1,405 company shares. The professional networking site's stock crashed this month on a weak 2016 forecast, which came after the company killed its marketing-centered Lead Accelerator segment.LinkedIn shares jumped 12.9%.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.Image provided by Shutterstock.

270,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) proposed merger with smaller U.S. rival Rite Aid (RAD) isn't a done deal yet, since regulators need to greenlight the $17 billion deal first.But analyst Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research put out a report this week questioning whether the merger will be approved.After visiting with management last week, he wrote: ""We have even more doubt that the merger with (Rite Aid) will be approved.""""While clearly not trying to, (Walgreens) appeared to make a good case against the deal,"" Mushkin said.Mushkin says management indicated that independent pharmacies tend to be located in areas that are not of interest to chain pharmacies such as Walgreens, Rite Aid and No. 2 drug store retailer  CVS Health (CVS) -- rural locations, for example -- and that those non-chain providers also are focused on providing specialized services ""that do not make sense for chain drug stores."" Without independent pharmacies playing in the same market to offer competition to these bigger players, it may not sit well with regulators.Mushkin also said that Walgreens indicated it has some potential buyers lined up for unwanted Rite Aid stores, but the government ""may be concerned"" whether any buyers would actually turn in viable offers, given tough industry dynamics and subpar assets that would be offered. That could further limit competition.The Obama administration has become more skeptical of big takeovers over time. The FTC in December took legal action to block Staples' (SPLS) takeover of Office Depot (ODP), the No. 1 and No. 2 office supply chains. Staples plans to fight the deal in court.Walgreens' management noted that it also would seek to merge some Rite Aid locations into Walgreens stores and viewed Rite Aid stores as ""generally inferior"" to Walgreens stores, Mushkin wrote.""Perhaps even more important is that after listening to management, we expect that as Rite Aid's leases come up for renewal, (Walgreens) would look to actively prune Rite Aid's store base,"" he said.Mushkin concluded: ""This is a great profit enhancer for Walgreens Boots Alliance, but a potentially significant choice reducer for the consumer.""Walgreens has previously said the acquisition of Rite Aid and its 4,500 stores is going as planned. It's expected to close in the latter half of this year.Despite Mushkin's doubts, Rite Aid stock has been holding steady in 2016 while Walgreens falls.

279,WBA,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

319,WBA,"Investors sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) up 1% Tuesday after the second-largest drugstore chain reported fourth-quarter earnings that met analyst views on earnings and slightly beat expectations on the top line.CVS earned an adjusted $1.53 a share in the quarter, up 28% from a year earlier and in line with views. Revenue rose 11% from a year earlier to $41.15 billion, slightly above the $41.13 billion analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected.Same-store sales overall increased 3.5%, above analysts' views for a 2.1% gain. Pharmacy same-store sales were up 5%, but front-end same-store sales were down 0.5%, which management blamed on softer customer traffic, partially offset by an uptick in basket size. A mild flu season may have modestly impacted sales to the downside, analysts say.It was the first quarter that tobacco sales were not part of year-over-year comparisons. Tobacco products were eliminated in all stores in early September 2014.Pharmacy same-store sales would have been 470 basis points higher if not for recent generic introductions, the company said.Fourth-quarter revenue in the company's pharmacy services rose 11.1% to $26.5 billion, driven mostly by growth in its specialty pharmacy business, thanks to its acquisition of Omnicare in August. Pharmacy network claims in the quarter climbed 7.2% to 237.4 million claims.Chief Executive Larry Merlo noted that the company's pharmacy benefits management (PBM) side of the business has had a strong selling season for 2016, with gross client wins of $14.8 billion, which analysts figure add up to more than $1 billion of incremental wins late in the year vs. the company's previously disclosed wins.CVS's marketing pitch focused on its hybrid retail pharmacy and PBM businesses, which ""is resonating quite well in the marketplace,"" analyst Steven Valiquette of UBS told IBD. In the post-earnings conference call, management emphasized that the firm's PBM business is part of the solution, not the problem, since it aims to control drug spending, not increase it.""The pharmacy services segment continues to be a source of upside,"" analyst Ross Muken of Evercore ISI said in a note to investors.CVS didn't change its previous forecast for 2016 and the first quarter, which calls for adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 to $5.88 a share for the full year and $1.14 to $1.17 for the first quarter. The analyst forecast for Q1 is for $1.18 a share, and for the full year it's an estimated $5.83.That the company reaffirmed guidance ""should help quiet concerns of the macro malaise bleeding into what had been thought of as a highly defensive business,"" said Evercore's Muken.Shares of larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose 2.8%. No. 3 drugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD), which is being bought by Walgreens, added 0.1%.

333,WBA,"Sephora and Ulta (ULTA) are stealing market share from CVS (CVS) and other drugstores as teens gravitate toward ""authentic indie"" brands, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey, out late Tuesday.Mass beauty brands are ceding share to indie brands and labels that get social media backing, said analysts. A quick peek on Facebook's (FB) Instagram yields about 885,000 results for #Revlon and fewer than 499,000 for #CoverGirl — both drugstore brands — but more than 2.5 million results for #UrbanDecay, a popular cosmetics label that can be purchased at both Ulta and Sephora.CoverGirl has steadily slipped down the rankings with upper-income female teens, falling to fourth place from second place, year over year, while Urban Decay's share has risen with all teen girls.Tied to that is the increased preference for specialty beauty retailers. Sephora nabbed a significant 38% chunk in Piper Jaffray's latest survey, climbing from 19% in the spring and up from 22% in fall 2014's poll among upper-income teenage girls. Sephora is owned by LVMH, which trades on the Paris exchange.While Target (TGT) took top honors in the spring, Ulta knocked it down to third place this fall, taking the No. 2 spot behind Sephora with 19% share of the vote, up from 13% last year.

337,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said that its acquisition of smaller rival Rite Aid (RAD) is going as planned, as the drugstore chain turned in mixed first-quarter results and lifted the lower end of its full-year guidance.Earnings easily came out ahead of expectations, rising 27% to $1.03 a share, vs. views for 96 cents. But hefty revenue growth of 48.5% to $29 billion, primarily due to the 2014 merger of Walgreen with Alliance Boots, was not enough to top forecasts for $29.24 billion.Walgreens narrowed its annual earnings outlook by a nickel to $4.30-$4.55 from $4.25-$4.55 a share. Analysts expect EPS of $4.40.Walgreens' guidance assumes no material boost from the Rite Aid acquisition, which was first announced in late October and is expected to close in the latter half of this year. Both companies have received anticipated second requests from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the acquisition.Walgreens shares closed up 1.9% on the stock market today. Rite Aid dipped 0.9%. Rival CVS Health (CVS) eased 1.4%.""Even though EPS was much better than expectations, it's unlikely the stock will be up significantly, given the difficulty in interpreted numbers that have no comparison, the fact that adjusted operating income was lower than expected, and the company only raised the lower end of its adjusted cash FY16 EPS guidance range higher by $0.05,"" wrote Barclays analyst Meredith Adler.The company's U.S. retail pharmacy segment, which includes Walgreens and Duane Reade, saw total sales rise 4.2% in Q1, with same-store sales up 5.8%.The international retail pharmacy segment, which includes Boots and Benavides, had $3.5 billion in Q1 total sales. Comps rose 2.2% on a pro forma constant currency basis, with Walgreens citing ""particularly strong growth"" in Mexico and Ireland.The wholesale pharmaceutical division racked up $5.8 billion in sales in the first quarter, with 3.1% comp growth on a pro forma constant currency basis, minus acquisitions and dispositions.Walgreen combined with Alliance Boots in 2014 after acquiring the rest of the European drugstore company that it did not already own. Walgreens Boots Alliance divides results into domestic retail pharmacy, international retail pharmacy and wholesale pharmaceutical segments. Year-over-year results comparisons are not directly comparable as a result of reporting changes from the merger.Last month, beleaguered drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) struck a 20-year deal with Walgreens to offer treatments previously sold through the now-shuttered Philidor and to cut prices on generics.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Rite Aid Sales Slip; WellCare Shifts PBM WorkValeant To Cut Drug Prices In Team-Up With Walgreens.

The merger cast into doubt McKesson's long relationship with Rite Aid.For the fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson now expects EPS of $12.60-$12.90, down from an earlier forecast of $12.50-$13.00, saying that its profits will be lower than expected during the second half of the year.

But McKesson expects its current partnership with Rite Aid to ""continue through the end of fiscal 2017.""The forecasts could signify a considerable misstep for the company, FBR analyst Steven Halper said in a note Monday.""Over the years, MCK has rarely had an operational hiccup such as this in its core pharma segment,"" he wrote. ""It remains to be seen if the issues are temporary or more structural in nature.""The company, which buys drugs, holds them and supplies them to drugstores, said that it was reviewing its administrative cost structure for the fourth quarter. Drug distributors' profits hinge on the difference between the prices that manufacturers charge them to buy the drugs and the prices that they can charge in selling the drugs to retailers.The EPS outlook for 2016 does not include any restructuring that the review may bring, the company said.McKesson reports third-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

Michael Niemira, chief economist there, had in May forecast that June same-store sales would likely rise in the range of 1% to 2%.June's A WallflowerTypically, June acts as a lull between Mother's Day shopping in May and when back-to-school sales ramp up in late July and early August. ""June is sort of a transitionary month,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, who called the numbers ""lackluster.""Warm weather and a falling unemployment rate haven't been enough to muster consistent growth in the retailers still providing monthly sales statistics.""The long-term impact that the Great Recession has had has definitely tempered spending,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Wage increases have been very small during the recovery. The retailers are still waiting for the consumer to show up.""One of those retailers, Costco (COST), was hurt by the strong dollar and fallen gasoline prices as its overall June showing of a 1% decline missed the consensus of a 0.1% decline. It was Costco's sixth miss during the past seven months.Gasoline prices have rebounded to a degree since last year's 50% collapse in crude oil prices, but they're still below where prices were a year earlier.

Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.7%. June sales at its Old Navy unit grew a disappointing 1%, less than the 2.3% consensus.

Rite Aid's front-end sales rose 0.3% from a year earlier, falling short of forecasts of a 1.8% gain.Specialty clothier Zumiez (ZUMZ) had a 3.3% decline in sales, performing worse than the 3.2% drop that analysts expected.Cato (CATO), a Charlotte, N.C.-based women's fashion retailer, posted no gain in June sales, better than the 1% decline forecast.Fred's (FRED), a discount retailer based in Memphis, Tenn., fell short of views, posting a 1.6% year-over-year gain; analysts expected 1.9%.San Diego-based warehouse club PriceSmart (PSMT) turned in a 4% gain in June comparable sales, beating the forecast for 3%. Its quarterly report after the bell Thursday fell short of expectations, though, and the stock slipped after hours.Home ImprovementsDespite retail being flat for June, consumers have opened their wallets in other areas, such as home improvement. Firms such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) announced in May they had strong Q1 sales.The impact of lower gasoline prices — a problem for Costco's revenue — is being felt as a positive effect in other areas of the U.S. economy, Niemira told IBD.""Anything house-related seems to have picked up,"" he said.

347,WBA,"With seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth, prescription drug and medical supplies distributor McKesson is in its strongest financial run in years.
"
348,WBA,"The company should continue generating robust sales, thanks to a key retail partnership and favorable secular trends in health care, including increasing demand for medications from an aging baby boomer generation.
"
349,WBA,"McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.
"
350,WBA,"Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.
"
351,WBA,"Top-Line Lift
"
352,WBA,"The agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.
"
353,WBA,"McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.
"
354,WBA,"The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.
"
355,WBA,"""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""
"
356,WBA,"The company also has a partnership with Omnicare (OCR), which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.
"
357,WBA,"During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.
"
358,WBA,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 13% this fiscal year and another 15% in fiscal 2017.
"
359,WBA,"McKesson's stock price touched a high of 243.61 on May 19 and currently trades near 231. The stock is up more than 10% in 2015.
"
360,WBA,"A McKesson spokeswoman said that executives were not available to comment for this article. At a conference in May, Chief Financial Officer James Beer offered a bullish outlook on the fiscal year ahead.
"
361,WBA,"""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.
"
362,WBA,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
363,WBA,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
364,WBA,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
365,WBA,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
366,WBA,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
367,WBA,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
368,WBA,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.
"
369,WBA,"""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.
"
370,WBA,"CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""
"
371,WBA,"In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.
"
372,WBA,"Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.
"
373,WBA,"Boomer Boost
"
374,WBA,"Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.
"
375,WBA,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
376,WBA,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.
"
377,WBA,"Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.
"
378,WBA,"As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.
"
379,WBA,"All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""With seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth, prescription drug and medical supplies distributor McKesson is in its strongest financial run in years.The company should continue generating robust sales, thanks to a key retail partnership and favorable secular trends in health care, including increasing demand for medications from an aging baby boomer generation.McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies.

380,WBA,"So was the Thursday selloff just a flash in the pan? Was it another short-term bottom? Traders seem to think so; they went bargain hunting to start the month of May on a high note as they took the Dow back up 183 pts ... But were there any real bargains? Not so much, just slightly reduced prices, but enough to cause the trader types to jump back in.
"
381,WBA,"Despite Friday's strength, the major averages all ended lower for the week. Nasdaq tumbling by 1.7%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 fell by 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The macro data last week continued to confirm confusion ... The ISM reported that manufacturing activity continues to hold steady ... as they reported a read of 51.5 — unchanged from March — but a bit below what analysts had expected. Remember, anything above 50 is a sign of expansion; so if you believe the numbeR, then we are seeing continued growth in the manufacturing sector. The confusion comes from the fact that the committee noted that 15 of the 18 maufacturing industries reported growth in April vs. the 10 in March, so supposedly a broader distribution, yet the overall number was unchanged ... someone is not being completely honest here ... Math is a funny thing; you can manipulate the numbers anyway you want .. .
"
382,WBA,"In a separate report the Commerce Dept. showed an unexpected drop in construction spending in March. The report said construction spending fell by 0.6% vs. the expected rise of 0.5%. And the Univ of Mich said what? Sentiment remains robust at 95.9 — and so the mkt, with all the conflicting data — continues to trade near record highs.
"
383,WBA,"Earnings this quarter disappointed almost on a daily basis — but investors did not seem to care. Earnings are history — it's over — it is the forward guidance that is important. European macro data also did not set any records — yet those markets are teasing with multiyear highs as well. Asia's macro data are mixed and those market are all trading up ... so what is the common theme? Come on, you know the answer ... The central banks. And so as long as the central banks are playing such a key role, the markets will never really trade on their own which is why global mkts are teasing with new or all time highs ...
"
384,WBA,"Central banks are not going away. The Fed is not in any rush to raise rates. June is off the table and my bet is that September is as well. The ECB is not going anywhere and anytime Chinese or Japanese macro data shows any weaknes, the conversation turns to more stimulus and ""off we go.""
"
385,WBA,"Now do I think that the economic data will improve? Sure. Will 2015 turn out like 2014, where we got off to a weak start only to ""kill it"" at year end? Yes ... and analysts are already talking about the ""blowout"" 2nd quarter ... they note the ""encouraging"" signs about the labor mkt as initial jobless claims fell to 262k last week, the lowest reading in 15 years as wages supposedly rose by 2.6%. Friday brings us the Non-Farm Payroll report and all expectations are for a ""significant"" rebound — making the April figure the ""outlier,"" allowing the statisticians to dismiss it, causing investors to celebrate. Talk of better days ahead for the second half of the year is all the rage.
"
386,WBA,"Funny how this works. Last week we learned that a large number of retailers are getting ready to start to shut down so many stores . .. and that means putting people out of work ... So I ask: How much longer can the mkt remain so disconnected from the economic reality? Below is just a short list of the coming closings and it is not encouraging at all:

387,WBA,"180 Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), 150 American Eagle (AEO), 223 Barnes and Noble (BKS), 265 Body Central (BODY), 120 Chico's (CHS), 200 Children's Place (PLCE), 340 Dollar Tree (DLTR), 31 Fredrick's of Hollywood (FOHL), 40 JCPenney's (JCP), 14 Macy's (M), 400 Office Depots (ODP), 200 Walgreens (WBA). .. and the list goes on.
"
388,WBA,"Yet investors celebrate this news — because these companies are becoming leaner and meaner- agreed, agreed. But what about the job losses?
"
389,WBA,"Valuations are now running at 17.4 x the past 12 months earnings . .. that is 19% higher than the 10-yr average of 14.6 and with 360 companies having reported Q1 earnings — profits are set to show a decline of only 0.4%, a far cry from the -4.6% expectation .. . and this is happening in a weak recovery. Could it just have been that analysts overestimated the impact of the dollar or the state of the global recovery? Or are we still seeing companies manage their bottom lines via cost cuts vs. real top line growth? Yes, Yes and Yes.
"
390,WBA,"The wild card remains what the Fed will do — and until the data becomes more consistent the lack of clarity will continue. Now don't get me wrong ... the Fed has been clear about what will cause them to raise rates — we just have not gotten there yet. But when we do I think the mkt will celebrate a move ... investors and the mkt both realize that rates need to go up. They know that we can't do this for much longer ... A rise in rates will show strength and a return to normalcy — In fact when it does happen, I think the mkt will celebrate - singing, ""Here comes the Sun.""

Eurozone Manf PMI's were better than the estimates...52 vs. 51.9, Germany was 52.1 vs. 51.9 and talk of more stimulus out of China. Remember that most of Europe was closed on Friday for May Day, so they are also playing catch up.

392,WBA,"Greece continues to dominate the int'l talk shows and although they are still far from any agreement — PM Tsipiras is working hard to try and convince his creditors to back off ... He has 3 days to go before the ECB next decision on emergency aid.

Meanwhile, rival drugstore chain Rite Aid's (RAD) stock rose slightly despite so-so August company sales figures.A CVS Health Research Institute study said that cigarette pack sales fell 1% at gas stations, convenience stores, big box stores, and other retailers in states where CVS had a 15% or greater share of the retail pharmacy market vs. states with no CVS pharmacies. Overall nicotine patch sales, meanwhile, showed a 4% increase in CVS-heavy states.CVS, the No. 2 U.S. pharmacy chain as well as a pharmacy benefits manager, has lost sales from its tobacco ban to rivals such as Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) as well as dollar stores such as Dollar General, but saw the move as an important branding effort to emphasize health.CVS Health rose 0.6% to 101.70 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, just creeping above the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, Rite Aid, the No. 3 drugstore operator, said August same-store sales increased 1.6% vs. a year ago. That lagged some estimates.Pharmacy same-store sales rose 2.1%, including a negative impact of around 222 basis points from new generic launches. Front-end same-store sales grew 0.6%.Rite Aid's total drugstore sales for the five weeks ended Aug. 29 rose 1.6% over last year to $2.5 billion. Prescription sales made up 69.6% of the total.""We are encouraged by (Rite Aid's) front-end same-store sales results, the highest year-over-year growth since March,"" noted analyst Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.But Rite Aid's same-store pharmacy results have showed ""a notable slowdown"" this year due to tough comparisons from last year's ObamaCare boost, an industry-wide phenomenon, he noted.""However, we expect this slowdown to begin reversing itself in the back half of (Rite Aid's) fiscal year,"" especially accelerating in the fourth quarter, Muken said.Rite Aid will report August-ending Q2 results later this month.In Thursday's report, Rite Aid said Q2 same-store sales increased 2.1%, with front-end same-store sales up a fraction and pharmacy same-store sales up 2.8%. Analysts expect Q2 earnings of 4 cents per share, down from last year's 13 cents.Rite Aid is the smallest of the three major drugstore chains in the U.S., with 4,561 stores as of Aug. 29. Rite Aid stock rose 1.1% to 8.25 in afternoon trading. Shares recently found support at the 200-day line.No. 1 Walgreens Boots Alliance advanced 1% to 88.73. Shares have been trading between the 50-day and 200-day lines.Of the three, Walgreens is the highest rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99. CVS has an 81 score and Rite Aid a 59.

"
414,WBA,"The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.
"
415,WBA,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.
"
416,WBA,"Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.
"
417,WBA,"On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.
"
418,WBA,"Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.
"
419,WBA,"Among The Big Processors
"
420,WBA,"The company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.
"
421,WBA,"Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments. It expanded its growth organically via a strong referral business and inorganically through a few key acquisitions.
"
422,WBA,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
423,WBA,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
424,WBA,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
425,WBA,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
426,WBA,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
427,WBA,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
428,WBA,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
429,WBA,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
430,WBA,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
431,WBA,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
432,WBA,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
433,WBA,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
434,WBA,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
435,WBA,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
436,WBA,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
437,WBA,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
438,WBA,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
439,WBA,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
440,WBA,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end.

441,WBA,"Accelerating growth is hard to come by in this economy. Had the economic recovery since 2009 been merely average, U.S. GDP would be bigger to the tune of $16,000 per household.Yet despite the sluggish economy, some big-cap companies are showing acceleration in earnings and revenue.The Big Cap 20 features several companies that are stepping up growth.Starbucks (SBUX) grew quarterly earnings on a year-earlier basis by 14%, 18% and most recently 24%. Revenue expanded by 13%, 18% and again 18% in the same period.How rare is that? Among roughly four dozen restaurants trading above $12 a share, only one besides Starbucks shows a similar achievement on the top and bottom lines. (It's DineEquity (DIN), a small cap.)Starbucks broke out in January and is now more than 30% above its original buy point. The stock has climbed steadily, pausing to brush just above the 50-day line in April. Starbucks recently pulled off its high and could be approaching a second brush with the 50-day line.If that develops along with a bounce off the line, that would constitute a secondary buy range.The Retail-Restaurants stock group was a respectable No. 48 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance in Monday's IBD.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) stepped up quarterly earnings from 12% to 14%, 15% and 20%. Revenue expanded 12%, 16%, 20% and 23% in the same quarters.The company provides technology outsourcing services.Cognizant broke out Wednesday. The 5% buy zone runs to 69.36. The RS line — which measures relative price strength vs. the S&P 500 — is at a 52-week high.The Computer-Tech Services stock group was No. 38 in Monday's IBD.Of stocks trading above 12, Cognizant is the only stock in its group delivering accelerated growth on the top and bottom lines.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) pumped up earnings growth from 1% to 8%, 22% and 23% in recent quarters. Revenue grew 6%, 7%, 36% and 48% in the same period.The stock broke out in July and remains in its 5% buy zone. The buy zone runs to 98.20.The Retail-Drug Stores stock group was No. 49 in Monday's IBD.Walgreens Boots is the only stock in its five-stock group that stepped up growth on both the top and bottom lines.Looking for acceleration among Big Cap 20 stocks isn't a bad place to begin a search for buy or watch-list candidates.Going into the start of Monday's session, the Big Cap 20 was outperforming the major stock market indexes this year. The Big Cap 20 was up 8% vs. 6% for the Nasdaq, 1% for the S&P 500 and 0% for the small-cap Russell 2000.

482,WBA,"New ad formats helped Alphabet (GOOGL) -owned video wing YouTube attract more ad revenue throughout last year, even as YouTube's share of the market is expected to recede as competitors led by Facebook (FB) muscle in to the segment, according to an eMarketer report released Wednesday.U.S. video ad revenue growth for YouTube in the U.S. will fall 6.2% in 2017, eMarketer estimates, and YouTube's share of the video ad market will slip. The decreases reflect growing competition as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO), Vimeo and others push further into ad-supported video. YouTube, however, will remain No. 1, with a 17.7% share of the total U.S. video ad revenue pie in 2017, says the report.Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) were the biggest ad spenders on YouTube in 2015, the report said, citing Pixability, the YouTube ad-buying and video-marketing platform that examined how much the National Retail Federation's top-10 U.S. brands spent quarter by quarter on YouTube last year.Wal-Mart upped its spending from $600,000 in Q1 to $2.5 million in Q4, and spent $5.2 million for the year, according to the report. Target shelled out $57,000 in Q1, $1.8 million in Q4 and $2.8 million for the year, the report said.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also increased its spending during the year, from $12,000 in Q1 to $88,000 in Q4, and a total of $151,000 for the year.In April, YouTube introduced Trueview, a video ad ""buy button"" that lets users buy items by clicking on a banner inside the ad. Trueview has boosted ad spending, says the report.But not every brand boosted their spending on YouTube last year, eMarketer found.Amazon.com (AMZN), Lowe's (LOW), The Home Depot (HD) and CVS (CVS) decreased their spending during the course of 2015. E-commerce king Amazon spent about $1.7 million on digital video advertising on YouTube in Q1, but just $162,000 in Q4, the report said.In U.S. digital advertising, Google's share is expected to dip nearly 5% to 36.6% in 2015, according to estimates from eMarketer. That follows a 3% drop to 38.4% in 2014.

581,WBA,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s Rite Aid store purchase, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens Boots reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Solid pharmacy sales growth encourages us. Moreover, the company has been gaining from strategic tie-ups. We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ alliance with Express Scripts, aiming to expand both companies’ existing group purchasing efforts.This latest pact is likely to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain, making medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.This apart, the Rite Aid deal seems to benefit Walgreens Boots in more ways than one. Accordingly, the collaboration allowed Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to the company’s for about 10 years, which buoys optimism. Also, Rite Aid provides Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post the deal closure.The deal’s financial value is attractive. Post the transaction’s initial completion, synergies of $300 million are estimated to be realized within a span of four years. The amount will be derived, primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.We are hopeful about Walgreen Boots’ global footprint expansion with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores, a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On its culmination, this investment should add a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives, major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses, flaunting a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Also, an escalated reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been denting Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.In June 2018, Walgreens Boots sold a 30% interest in Chinese drug wholesaler Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The alliance was formed back in 2008 as an equal partnership between Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and legacy Alliance Boots. Although, this sell-off follows a lucrative cash return offer, its overall impact on the company’s business may induce an adverse impact.Over the past three months, shares of Walgreens Boots have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 1.7%, wider than the industry’s 1.4% gain.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report).Genomic Health projects an earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker has a projected long-term earnings growth rate of 9.7%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Integer Holdings has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 15%. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

582,WBA,"Now a literal household name, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has experienced meteoric growth since its May 1997 IPO, since which its stock price has soared an astounding 111,260%. This represents about hundred times more growth than any of its industry competitors over that same time frame. This year alone, Amazon is up nearly 43% compared to an industry average of 9.2%.With this much growth already baked into its stock price, many investors may feel that Amazon stock is too expensive and that they have missed their chance to cash in. Is this truly the case? Let’s take a look.An Ever-Expanding Sphere of InfluenceOur team reported on Thursday that shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) plummeted on news that Amazon would purchase online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move is part of the firm’s push into the $400 billion industry. While specific details have not yet been released, the idea is that the firm would sell prescription medicines online.This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into healthcare. The company announced in January that it, alongside Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), would begin “partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.” The partnership will see the formation of an independent company, at which a top-level executive from each respective firm will take lead.Amazon also announced Delivery Service Partners on Thursday, a new program that is designed to let local entrepreneurs manage and operate delivery networks with up to 40 vans within their respective regions. The move puts firms like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) directly in their crosshairs. It said that the move would involve “hundreds” of small businesses and ultimately result in the hiring of “tens of thousands” of delivery drivers across the country.This week, Amazon began rolling out special deals for its Prime members to Whole Foods, which it acquired in August of last year. According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, this could double Whole Foods’ customer base. Amazon is also expanding Go, its cashier-free convenience store initiative which made its public debut in January of last year.Amazon’s sphere of influence is only continuing to expand. It is difficult to fathom that the same firm which at one point only sold books, now has a presence in retail, logistics, media production, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, just to name a few of its numerous ventures. What makes the company interesting is the fact that it continues to invest and expand into new territory, just as its recent news announcements have shown us.By the NumbersAmazon had a stellar earnings report in April, delivering first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.05 (168%) and representing 121% year-over-year growth. The company also reported $51.04 billion in revenue, beating our Consensus Estimate by almost a billion dollars and representing 43% in year-over-year growth.Product sales, which account for 61.9% of Amazon’s overall sales, increased 33.2% year-over-year to $31.61 billion, while service sales (which account for the other 38.1%) rose 62.2% year-over-year to $19.44 billion. This was driven largely by Amazon’s physical store presence through Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Physical store sales accounted for $7.46 billion in revenue compared to our $4.35 billion Consensus Estimate.The strong earnings report was also guided in part by strong performance in Amazon’s Web Services division (AWS), which saw revenues climb 48.6% year-over-year to $5.44 billion. The change was primarily driven by an expanding customer base, which included the addition of enterprise customers such as LG Electronics and Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report). AWS now accounts for ~11% of Amazon’s total revenue and ~73% of its operating income, and holds a third of the global cloud computing services market.Investors should take note of Amazon’s 12-Month Forward P/E ratio of 101x, which is notably lower than its F1 2018 ratio of 130.4x. The ratio shifted dramatically in April, as analysts significantly raised their estimates on the back of the firm’s extremely strong earnings report.Investors may also notice that the aforementioned 12-Month Forward P/E of 101x still appears to hold a significant premium to the industry average of 23.7x. The reason why this is the case however, is because Amazon sacrifices profits in the short-term to fund its many different initiatives. This reduces earnings and thus inflates the ratio. This aggressive investment strategy is what has allowed Amazon to grow in such an explosive fashion. One good example is AWS, which was not immediately profitable as the firm created its infrastructure, but now represents one of its most lucrative divisions.The effects of Amazon’s investment strategy become clear when we look at the last five years of Amazon’s earnings estimate history, represented by the green line:Note that although earnings estimates for F1 2018 sat at $8.69 per share before April’s report, they currently sit at $12.74 per share. That Amazon’s estimates have continuously increased is a testament to analyst confidence that its various initiatives have not only already brought in results but will continue to do so.Here is another point that investors may find interesting:Although Amazon is burning through cash to fuel their operations, it has been increasing its margins consistently for the last six years. This is important because it tells us that Amazon is becoming more efficient at converting sales into actual profit. Once Amazon’s newer investments turn profitable, it will mean that Amazon can potentially continue to pull off earnings surprises as significant as last quarter’s 168% beat.OutlookAlthough investors may feel hesitant about Amazon’s current stock price, various signs point to it being warranted rather than overhyped. With a perpetually growing product portfolio, aggressive operations investment, and increasing margins, Amazon is positioning itself to dominate multiple industries at once for years to come.While nothing is certain, investors should remain aware of the possibility that should they attempt to wait for a better entry point to invest, it may never come. Regardless of if investors choose to purchase Amazon stock, they should continue to monitor its performance. As its various divisions continue to grow, an increasing number of firms will see their business models threatened.Amazon currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

583,WBA,"Shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) all plummeted on Thursday morning after Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced its purchase of online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move clearly has some investors worried that Amazon’s push into the pharmaceutical industry will hurt the current powers. So let’s take a look at more of the details to find out what’s really going on.PillPackAmazon is reportedly set to acquire PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack launched in 2013 and ships pre-sorted medications by the dose to patients on a monthly basis. The company, which is a full-service pharmacy, works mostly with customers who take multiple daily prescriptions and coordinates refills and renewals with doctors and customers.The Manchester, New Hampshire-based pharmacy delivery startup said that it ships everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii. PillPack has raised $118 million in venture capital funding, and its co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The deal should be hugely beneficial for Jeff Bezos’ behemoth, which now enters the quickly growing, $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The news saw shares of CVS sink 9.36% through early morning trading, with Rite Aid down 11.17% and Walgreens down 8.59%.Meanwhile, shares of Amazon climbed over 1.1%. But pharmaceutical industry investors shouldn’t be too worried that Amazon will simply waltz in and take over.It’s Not Over, YetAmazon’s PillPack acquisition comes roughly a year after the company shook up the grocery industry with its Whole Foods purchase. Investors worried at the time that grocery heavyweights such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) would all take a big hit, and possibly crumble underneath Amazon’s quick delivery e-commerce model. This turned out not to be the case—at least not yet (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).All four of these grocery industry powers simply revamped their business models and dove right into everything from same-day delivery and easy to use e-commerce portals, through partnerships with startups as well as in-house initiatives. Today, the grocery industry and customers are likely better off than they were before Amazon bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion because it forced them all to offer more.Sometimes lost in the narrative that Amazon will one day dominate the world, is that the e-commerce giant’s multibillion-dollar competitors, many of which have been around much longer than Amazon, can adapt—and have every reason to fight back. In fact, Walgreens executives were in the middle of a call with analysts when Amazon announced its PillPack deal. CEO Stefano Pessina said his company is “not particularly worried” about the e-commerce giant’s newest acquisition.Pessina went on to say that his drugstore chain is “not complacent.” He also said that “the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages. I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Investors should note that Walgreens is ramping up its delivery options and adding to its in-store health-related services. Meanwhile, CVS announced just last week that it will offer its customers prescription delivery options through a new deal with the U.S. Postal Service.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

584,WBA,"Shares of several major pharmaceutical retailers—including Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report)—surged in afternoon trading Monday after reports emerged that e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has shelved its plan to sell prescription drugs to doctors and hospitals.According to CNBC, Amazon’s now-paused plan involved Amazon Business, a service that sells bulk items to business customers. The company was considering using this unit to begin selling pharmaceutical products but has decided to focus on selling less-sensitive medical supplies to hospitals and smaller clinics, CNBC reported.The original report suggested that Amazon was not able to convince bigger customers to change their traditional purchasing process. This existing structure typically involves longstanding relationships and a number of middlemen.What’s more, Amazon would have needed to build a sophisticated supply chain capable of handling temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical products, according to people familiar with the matter cited by CNBC. Still, Amazon has reportedly not ruled out getting into the prescription business at a later time.Amazon is hardly new to the medical supplies market—the company holds the licensing needed to sell products like glucometers and stethoscopes in 47 states—but traditional industry players have a logistical and strategic advantage over the relative newcomer.“Amazon Business serves healthcare customers of all sizes, from large IDNs [integrated delivery networks, meaning systems that provide both medical services and a health insurance plan to patients] to small- and medium-sized community hospitals,” Amazon told CNBC. “We also serve customers from physician and dental offices to senior living and long-term care facilities.”Earlier reports that Amazon was looking to expand into the prescription market rattled retailers like CVS and Walgreens. Shares of these companies surged on the news that Jeff Bezos and company were putting a pause on the idea.CVS popped nearly 8% to touch an intraday high of $68.90 in early afternoon trading, while Walgreens added about 7% to reach $68.15. Both of these stocks have now bounced off their 52-week lows in the low $60s.Nevertheless, the story in terms of analyst outlook for CVS and Walgreens has been quite a bit different recently. Estimates for Walgreens’ full-year earnings have trended higher, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate adding 14 cents over the past 60 days on the back of strong analyst agreement. The company is now projected to witness EPS growth of 16% in 2018.Meanwhile, CVS has witnessed three revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s annual earnings has lost four cents over the past 60 days. This negative revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

585,WBA,"Fred's, Inc.  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 18, before the opening bell. Well, the company has been reeling under soft comparable store sales (comps) for quite some time now, which along with intense promotional activity has been weighing on its bottom line. Incidentally, the company has been reporting a loss for six straight quarters.The impact of these factors is clearly visible in investors’ sentiment, as the company’s shares have lost close to 81% in a year, as against the industry that gained nearly 18%. In fact, investors’ concerns over Fred’s upcoming release is also evident from the 9.3% drop in its stock price over the last seven trading sessions.  On that note, let’s delve deeper into the factors likely to impact this quarter and see if Fred’s strategic initiatives to counter these hurdles can provide any respite.Dismal Comps Raise ConcernsFred’s’ comps slipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively – mainly attributable to sluggish store traffic, which has also resulted in many store closures. Apart from this, persistent rise in generic dispensing rate, sale of low productive discontinued inventory, continued challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have been a drag on Fred’s. To make matters worse, Fred’s store expansion plans were gravely impacted by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017.Had the deal materialized, Fred’s would have emerged as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Obstacles such as antitrust concerns that cancelled the deal kept Fred’s behind industry leaders. Other than this, the company has also been undertaking intense promotional activity that remains a threat to its margins.Focus on Cost Cuts & Traffic Driving Initiatives to Help?Nevertheless, Fred’s is making solid attempts to improve its business. To this end, the company has been making efforts to drive store traffic, which has shifted its focus to pharmacy organization. This is likely to drive scripts into its stores and enhance services for patients. Notably, Fred’s Retail Pharmacy business seems to be stable, benefiting from the company’s shift to profitable generic prescriptions. In order to improve retail pharmacy business, the company has been expanding flu shots capacity along with aggressive inventory management and marketing initiatives. Further, management continues to build momentum in the Specialty Pharmacy business through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology.Fred’s is also taking endeavors to curtail expenses to achieve profitability. Evidently, the company successfully reduced selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by 7% to $133.4 million in the last reported quarter. Further, management expects lower SG&A costs to help augment free cash flows. The company expects to pass the gains from the reduced cost structure to its customers and drive store traffic. Moreover, management plans to allocate funds derived from the cancelled dividend toward curtailing debt load, buyback shares and undertake other corporate initiatives.That said, let’s wait and see if these efforts can help Fred’s tide over the aforementioned hurdles and raise investors’ dwindling confidence in the stock.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

586,WBA,"Retail stocks have been the best market performers so far in 2018, handily outpacing the S&P 500.  The industry is up 20% year to date versus 6% for the S&P and some of the best performers, like Amazon (AMZN), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are up even more.In a blockbuster Q1 earnings season, one retail stock after another reported better-than expected revenues in an environment of low unemployment and Consumer Confidence at an 18-month high.Most of those increased sales have one thing in common – electronic payment. Approximately 67% of in-person sales and virtually 100% of online transactions are made with a credit or debit card. Consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and security of electronic transactions for large purchases all the way down to a cup of coffee.In the shift toward an essentially cashless economy, one big winner is the company who process electronic payments and transfers.Priceless GrowthMastercard (MA  -  Free Report) has been offering credit card processing services for issuing banks since 1966 – way back when credit card transactions happened on those sliding carbon-copy machines.  Originally organized as a cooperative of issuing banks, Mastercard went public in 2006 as an independent transaction processor.Mastercard now has gross sales of $15 billion a year and reported record results in Q1 with gross sales of $3.6B and earnings of $1.50/share, increases of 31% and 49% respectively over the same quarter in 2017. It was the 17th quarter in a row that Mastercard exceeded the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate and 16 subsequent upward revisions now have the consensus for full year 2018 at $6.31/share, an increase of 37% over 2017.  MA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Payment Solutions for EnterpriseWex Inc (WEX  -  Free Report) provides electronic payment solutions for businesses in three general areas: Fleet Services, Employee Travel and Healthcare. WEX partners with both the customers who utilize the company’s innovative virtual payment solutions and the vendors who provide the goods and services being purchased, using economies of scale to reduce transaction costs.WEX provides detailed information, insights and control over spending, allowing customers to manage costs and reduce paperwork.WEX has also invested in distributed ledger technology especially as it relates to crypto-currencies. Though Bitcoin and other cryptos are not yet widely used for everyday transactions, if they gain favor in the future, WEX will be ready to process payments - and likey one of the leaders in the iindustry.Thanks to steadily growing revenues and earnings, WEX shares have risen 36% in 2018. WEX is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Cash is not DeadAlthough an increasing amount of payments are performed electronically, cash is not dead yet, as many consumers and merchants continue to prefer currency for transactions. Especially when traveling, millions of customers rely on ATM machines for ready cash and operators get paid a fee on every withdrawal.Cardtronics Plc (CATM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest operator of ATMs, with 230,000 machines in 10 countries processing over 2.6 billion transactions per year. Their customers include large financial institutions like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), TD (TD) and Santander (SOV.C) as well as merchants including Target, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).With a history of positive earnings surprises, CATM posted a big earnings beat in Q1, reporting $0.46/share versus estimates of $0.26/share.Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Although new technologies are a lot more interesting to talk about, sometimes the biggest and best company is finding the opportunities for big earnings in the “old” space. Cardtronics certainly has found them in ATMs.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

588,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) has achieved a historic feat yesterday on emerging as the youngest participant on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) or DJIA. This is a momentous exploit not just because this goliath stock has entered the world’s most coveted index but more so for dramatically replacing Dow’s oldest member, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). With this success, Walgreens stalled GE’s uninterrupted run on the exchange for 110 long years.The change will be effective Jun 26 market opening.Let’s delve deeper into the significance of the decision for Dow investors.GE Booted Off: How Far is This Logical?The S&P Dow Jones indices report says that “General Electric was an original member of the DJIA in 1896 and a member continuously since 1907”. However, per the index, this decision was prompted by the GE stock’s persistent trading at a low price of late, which affected the entire index’s price performance in turn. Going by the report, “the DJIA is a price-weighted index and the range of prices among its 30 constitutes matter. The low price of GE shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point.”Overall, GE’s market capitalization rose to $594 billion in 2000 and has shrunk unbelievably over the years to $111.87 billion at present.Over the past year, shares of GE have nose-dived by more than 50%, a significant plunge justifying the above logic. If we compare the stock with its broader industry, the stock has plummeted 52.1% compared with the industry’s 16.7% decline.For the same time frame, DJIA has rallied 16.9% and another sought-after index, S&P 500, remained slightly below at 13.7% growth. Both indices however, remained far above the General Electric’s tally. Walgreens’ DJIA Foray: Does it Make Sense?While talking about the decision to incorporate Walgreens on the DJIA index, the S&P Dow Jones indices report informed that Walgreens will contribute more meaningfully to the index as its share price is higher than GE’s. The stock will also help the index represent the U.S. market and economy in a better way.The investment world has already been dissected into two with respect to this impactful decision. Per David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P’s index committee, industrial companies like GE no longer hold prominence in the American economy, whereas healthcare, banks, tech and consumer companies race as front runners now.From Walgreens’ point of view, this world’s first pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise has never has been shoved away from the limelight, courtesy of its consistent flow of strategic developments. The company has been formed through the combination of legacy Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The merger brought together a couple of companies with compelling portfolios and iconic brands, complementary geographies, shared values and trusted health care services via pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care.Recently, in a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens has tied up with Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) and announced plans to expand their existing group purchasing efforts. Also, Walgreens’ Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational as well as financial benefits.Following the news, shares of Walgreens gained 5.24% to $68 at yesterday’s close.The Opposite ViewOn the flip side, some are questioning the practicality of substitution as CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a bigger contender of Walgreens in the similar field in terms of market cap, volume and prescription revenues.According to the analysts, Walgreens incurred immense debt to maintain its expansion through acquisition strategy.The company’s long-term debt shot up to $12.5 billion as of February 2018 from $3.7 billion in August 2013 (per a Wall Street Journal report).Moreover, while CVS Health is currently in the process to complete its $69-billion Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, its decision to buy the health insurerhas been taken quite positively by the investment world. Economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s mounting health-care costs. In spite of this huge prospect, CVS Health not present in the list of 30 Dow members is putting the investors in sort of dilemma. Walgreens’ stock performance too is currently not looking much convincing. Over the past year, shares of Walgreens have lost 17.9%, outperforming the DJIA and S&P 500 index. The broader industry has witnessed a 10.7% decline. Per a Bloomberg report, “On paper, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is an underwhelming choice for inclusion in the world’s most famous stock index.”How Significant the ‘Delete’ & ‘Replacement’ Will Be?According to many investment experts, the General Electric-Walgreens case is more of a publicity stance for Dow, gradually losing its sheen since the economic recession of the 1990s. Going by a Reuters’ article, “GE is currently the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index’s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.”A Lipper data also concluded that while just $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds attached to the Dow, ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index, have assets of around $380 billion. Undoubtedly, next week, GE’s exit and Walgreens’ entry may not have any relevant effect on the performance of the index.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

590,WBA,"General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), the American multinational conglomerate, and the last original company from the 1986 Dow, is no longer on the 30-stock index. After 110 years, GE was booted off the Dow yesterday and will be replaced by pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report).General Electric was once the American golden child. The company, which was founded by Thomas Edison, was popular for making consumer products and industrial machinery.  GE was the first to invent or commercialize products such as the famous lightbulb and the electric fan. In August 2017, former CEO Jeff Immelt stepped down from his position. Since then, what once was a legendary company has been in a downward spiral. According to Forbes, Immelt lacked vision for his company and hardly led GE into new growth markets during his tenure. The company’s performance was poor during Immelt’s time and the stock fell 30% since he became CEO in 2001.General Electric has been the only company to be on the Dow continuously since 1986, even though others have come and go. According to CNBC, this change will have a positive impact and make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market. It can be seen that GE as a whole hasn’t been doing so well, as shares have fallen 55% in just over a year.  After the formal removal on June 26, we could potentially see the economic situation of the United States shift in regards to adding a healthcare company to the Dow.According to David Blitzer, the chairman of the S&P’s index committee, industrial companies like GE are not really prominent in the American economy anymore, whereas healthcare, banks, tech and consumer companies are the front runners. That is why the 30 most recent public companies that are included in the Dow are those which are boosting the economy and making a difference to the index. The company with the lowest share price on the Dow is none other than GE. The company’s share price is at $12.98 per share during intraday trading Tuesday, whereas the highest price on the Dow belongs to Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) at $343.50.The Dow is a price weighted index, which means the higher the price of the stocks, the better the influence of the direction that the Dow is headed in. That is why taking GE out of the index and adding Walgreens will likely better the direction and success of the Dow. Just today, Walgreens shares have gone risen 4.82% so far, hitting a high of $68.26 per share.This replacement will be the first big one since 2015, when Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) replaced AT&T (T  -  Free Report). We could potentially see a change in the consumer goods sector of the Dow with Walgreens’ addition. Since the Dow will and currently has companies that do well in the economy, the addition of a power house sector could make or break the future of the popular index.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

591,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected bottom-line results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, marking a considerable improvement from its recent trend. However, the top line continued to disappoint, lagging the estimates and declining year over year.The company’s improved bottom-line results can be attributed to the stabilization of reimbursement rates, a decline in drug purchasing costs and a record number of immunizations that enhanced pharmacy margins for the quarter.Other key highlights of the quarter were solid results at the Retail Pharmacy Segment with higher adjusted EBITDA, strong start to Pharmacy Services segment in the new commercial selling season just after the fourth quarter, completion of the sale of 1,932 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and a merger agreement with Albertsons Companies.As of Mar 27, 2018, Rite Aid completed the transfer of 1,932 stores and related assets to Walgreens for $4.157 billion. It now plans to transfer the three distribution centers and related inventory, starting Sep 1, 2018. With the cash proceeds, management has been lowering debt. As a result, its debt, net of cash, was $2.9 billion as of Mar 3, 2018.Additionally, the company agreed to merge with Albertsons on Feb 20, 2018. So far, the boards of directors of both the companies have approved the transaction and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired. The companies expect to close the merger in the second half of calendar year 2018.Though the transfer of stores to Walgreens and the merger with Albertsons are positives for the stock, it has declined 31.8% in the last three months, probably because of the lack of robust operating results. Moreover, the decline in share price reflects an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 16.6%.Q4 in DetailRite Aid reported adjusted loss per share of 1 cent in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 against earnings per share of 2 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss per share of 2 cents. While the bottom line was hurt by a decline in adjusted EBITDA, higher costs relating to the Walgreens deal, and increased lease termination and impairment charges, it was negated higher LIFO credit and improved reimbursement rates.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRevenues dropped 8.6% to $5,394.3 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,540 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues declined 10.1% on account of soft same-store sales and an extra week in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment declined 4.3% due to changes in the composition of Medicare Part D membership and a fall in commercial business.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales dipped 1.7%, owing to 2.3% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.6% decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 138 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Further, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.8% due to the omission of some pharmacy networks from the prior-year quarter. Prescription sales constituted 64.9% of total drugstore sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA dropped about 6.1% year over year to $157.4 million while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 10 bps to 2.9%. This was due to lower adjusted EBITDA at the Pharmacy Services segment; offset by favorable results for the Retail Pharmacy segment, primarily driven by improved reimbursement rates and enhanced generic purchasing. Pro-forma adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for fees related to the Walgreens transaction and the extra week in fiscal 2017, was $173.2 million, down 4.2% year over year.Store UpdateRite Aid continues to renovate stores with 38 remodeled and six relocated outlets in the fourth quarter. This brings the company’s total wellness-stores count to 1,805. Further, it sold 1,554 stores to Walgreens and shut 19 stores during the quarter, consequently taking the total store count to 2,831 as of Mar 3, 2018. Additionally, store count related to continuing operations were 1,651 and 2,550, respectively, for wellness stores and total stores.Financial StatusRite Aid ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $447.3 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $3,340.1 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,601 million.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s cash from operating activities was $87 million as of the end of fiscal 2018.OutlookFollowing the strong closure of fiscal 2018, Rite Aid outlined its initial view for fiscal 2019. Going forward, the company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement-rate environment than witnessed in fiscal 2018, TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal as well as other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. However, the company’s guidance does not include any impact of the pending transaction with Albertsons.Rite Aid estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated in the range of flat-to-up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $615-$675 million. Further, the company expects net loss of $40-$95 million in fiscal 2019. Adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of 2-6 cents compared with a loss per share of 2 cents reported in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it expects capital expenditures of nearly $250 million in fiscal 2019.Still Interested in the Retail Space? Check TheseInvestors can count on The Gap Inc.

592,WBA,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening:EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), which provides electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate 15% for 3-5 years.

The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 16% for 3-5 years.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), a pharmacy-led health and wellbeing company, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is currently 10.5%.CBRE Group, Inc.

593,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), following the completion of transferring stores to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report),  revealed that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired on Mar 28, 2018, satisfying one of the conditions for its merger with Albertsons Companies, Inc.Though Rite Aid shares did not react much to this announcement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 20.4% in the last three months.

594,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is progressing well toward the completion of its pending merger with the grocer, Albertsons Companies, Inc. The progress of the deal became evident, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) made the previously filed registration statement on Form S-4 effective.Following this, Rite Aid is now urging its shareholders to vote in favor of the merger deal. Voting, regarding the proposed transaction, will be carried out in the Special Meeting of Rite Aid shareholders, which is scheduled for Aug 9, 2018. Rite Aid’s shareholders, with record as of Jun 22, 2018, are entitled to cast votes in connection with the proposed deal.Though Rite Aid’s shares haven’t witnessed much positive momentum lately, we believe that the deal, after the completion, can begin a new chapter to its story. Shares of Rite Aid have declined nearly 6.9% on Jun 26. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 17.4% in the last three months, driven by optimism stemming from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the aforementioned merger developments.

595,WBA,"On Jun 19, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We are encouraged by the company’s consistent sales increase in the Retail Pharmacy International business. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining traction from a slew of strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.We are also upbeat about the company’s alliance with Express Scripts, via which, both companies aim to expand respective existing group purchasing efforts. This latest pact is expected to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain and make medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote The above positives apart, Walgreens Boots’ decision to buy a 40% stake in China’s Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores looks promising as that should provide a strong impetus to the company’s worldwide retail pharmacy business. The limited number of Rite Aid stores’ acquisitions also impresses us for which, the company has recently secured a regulatory approval.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives, major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses with a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins.

596,WBA,"On Jun 26, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) left the blue-chip index, Dow 30 after 111 years. The industrial giant will be replaced with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). This new member of the Dow is already in the news after it acquired at least 1,900 stores of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report). Additionally, around two-thirds of existing Rite Aid chain will undergo full store rebranding by the end of 2020.Meanwhile, the healthcare sector has jumped 3.2% in the last three months, becoming one of the best performing sectors among the S&P 500. Signs of the sector’s well-being became more evident in the past three months when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index have gained 1.3% and 4.4%, respectively.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance are scheduled to report earnings results on Jun 27 and Jun 28, respectively. In this respect, it may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both pharmaceutical retailers carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled on Jun 28 include NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) and Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceRite Aid has witnessed a decline of 50.1% over the past year, while Walgreens Boots Alliance has fallen 13.6%. Meanwhile, the broader industry has slumped 13.9% during the same period. Both pharmaceutical retailers have registered a decline, but Walgreens Boots Alliance is in a better position with respect to rival Rite Aid. Dividend YieldIn a year’s time, Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance have offered dividend yields of 0% and 2.4%, respectively, while the industry’s dividend yield is 2.4%. So Walgreens Boots Alliance clearly wins this round.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continuously draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.Rite Aid has registered a net loss margin of -0.36%. With a net margin value of 4.71%, Walgreens Boots Alliance performs better than rival Rite Aid as well as the broader industry, which has a net margin value of 3.66%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Rite Aid’s debt-to-equity ratio of 209.92% is significantly high compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 119.95%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 44.47%, Walgreens Boots evidently has a better leverage condition.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma retailers, Walgreens Boots with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.35 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 7.87. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.56, Rite Aid is underpriced than both Walgreens Boots and the industry.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Walgreens Boots has delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.33%. In comparison, Rite Aid did deliver positive earnings in three out of last four quarters, but its average positive earnings surprise is zero.When considering Earnings ESP, Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots have values of 0.00% and +0.88%, respectively, which implies that Walgreens Boots is at an advantage in this respect. Moreover, Walgreens Boots’ earnings estimates for the current year have advanced by 0.5% over the last 30 days, while Rite Aid’s earnings estimates for the current year remained unchanged. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Rite Aid holds an edge over Walgreens Boots when considering only EV/EBITDA ratio. However, when considering price performance, leverage position, net margins, estimate revisions and previous earnings performance, Walgreens Boots holds an advantage over Rite Aid. Additionally, Walgreens Boots has a better dividend yield than Rite Aid, making it a clearly better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Walgreens Boots at this point of time is that it has a better ESP than Rite Aid, indicating a likely positive surprise. This is why it may be better to bet on Walgreens Boots over Rite Aid as both prepare to report earnings this week.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

597,WBA,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) gained about 8% in early morning trading Tuesday after the struggling multinational conglomerate announced plans to spin off its health-care business and separate its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) over the next few years.The moves should help General Electric pare down its debt and sharpen its focus on core businesses like aviation, power, and renewable energy.“We are confident that positioning GE Healthcare and BHGE outside of GE’s current structure is best not only for GE and its owners, but also for these businesses, which will strengthen their market-leading positions and enhance their ability to invest for the future, while carrying the spirit of GE forward,” said CEO John Flannery in a statement.General Electric also noted that it will maintain its current quarterly dividend until after the spinoff of its health-care business is complete. The company then plans to adjust the dividend “in line with industrial peers.”GE’s new strategy aims to reduce the firm’s debt pile by about $25 billion by 2020 and generate at least $500 million in corporate cost savings through the end of that year.The much-needed turnaround plan comes on the same day that GE is officially being replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) on the Dow. GE was the last remaining original member of the index, but its recent struggles left many calling for more-accurate representation on the blue-chip gauge.General Electric shares have lost more than 50% over the past year and now sit about 80% lower than their all-time highs seen during the early 2000s. The company has struggled to find value in its assets over the past decade as a shifting economy left many of its businesses in the dust.Investors will hope that GE’s turnaround strategy can reinvigorate the stock, trim the company’s fat, and modernize its core businesses.They will also hope that today’s plan inspires some positive analyst sentiment for GE, which has watched its current-year earnings outlook deteriorate in recent weeks. Downward earnings estimate revisions have dragged our consensus projection for GE’s 2018 earnings three cents lower over the past quarter, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).General Electric is now expected to witness its annual earnings slump by about 9.5% year over year.Want more market analysis from this author?

599,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) successfully completed the transfer of all stores and related assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) under its amended and restated asset purchase agreement. As of Mar 27, 2018, it transferred all 1,932 stores and related assets to Walgreens for net cash proceeds of $4.157 billion.With the cash proceeds, management has been lowering debt, thus, solidifying its liquidity position. Per the agreement, Walgreens decided to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of $4.4 billion. While the transfer of stores and related assets is complete, the company plans to transfer the three distribution centers and related inventory, starting Sep 1, 2018.The company stated that majority of the closing conditions for the deal have been met and only a few conditions applicable to the distribution centers need to be satisfied.Additionally, Rite Aid revealed that it has ended the tax benefits preservation plan, which was announced on Jan 3, 2018. This plan helped the company to save nearly $2.2 billion of its operating losses. The plan was initially set to expire on Jan 3, 2019.The completion of the transfer of stores to Walgreens significantly boosted Rite Aid’s stock price, which rallied 12.8% on Mar 28. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 15.3% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s fall of 10.7%.Following the transfer of stores to Walgreens, Rite Aid, with more than 2,500 stores, is set to carry out the previously agreed proposal to merge with the country’s largest grocer, Albertsons Companies. Per the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave Rite Aid shareholders with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction.

606,WBA,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has decided to collaborate with Walgreens for providing better primary and other services to senior citizens via primary care clinics. Notably, Walgreens is a provider of trusted care, included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report). This alliance is part of the ongoing and shared commitment of both companies to the health and well-being of the Kansas City community.The partnership forged between Humana, a leading health and well-being company and Walgreens, the provider of trusted pharmacy services and care would essentially create a senior-focused neighborhood approach to health, which would include primary care, pharmacy, in-person health plan support and additional services for Medicare beneficiaries. The companies are also interested in expanding this collaboration into other markets in the near future.Partners in Primary Care, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana, would operate senior-focused primary care clinics (on a pilot basis) in two Walgreens stores in the Kansas City, Missouri area. Located most conveniently, the clinics are expected to open doors this fall with a spacious area of around 2,500 square feet and would complement Walgreens pharmacy services along with the four Partners in Primary Care centers, inaugurated last year in Kansas City.The clinics cater to aged people participating in a few Medicare plans. Partners in Primary Care focus on offering care services beyond addressing just the acute and immediate health issues. Additionally, the unit caters to developing long-term relationships with patients suffering chronic conditions.Humana currently provides health-related programming and resources to its more than 65,000 Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone Part D Prescription Drug plan members in the region. While Walgreens supports more than 75,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Kansas City community through above 50 neighborhood pharmacies and other points of care.Humana expects its initiative with Walgreens to deliver a way simpler and better experience for people, which would in turn encourage them to take care of their health more seriously while being closely in touch with the doctors. This senior-focused care by the company is a continuation of its strategy to revolve around integrating care via clinical programs intersecting health with lifestyle. The humanitarian service also supports Humana’s multi-faceted approach to healthcare in general.The win-win program has aided Walgreens to expand its pharmacy services and expertise plus drive the digital tools and other programs, aimed at helping the grey populace in the community. It is one of Walgreens’ efforts to make cost-effective healthcare accessible to patients, providing them with a value-for-money experience.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 20.86% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.87%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This deal charts out the obvious course of action for Walgreens as it braces itself well for handling the pressing competition from the likely entry of Amazon in the pharmacy business. Also, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) is on track to acquire Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), which should expand the combined entity’s scale and size in the industry.These health-oriented pacts point to the blurring of the boundaries between two subsectors of the healthcare industry such as, the pharmacies and drug stores and health insurers.

607,WBA,"On Jun 19, S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of S&P Global, announced the departure of the beleaguered conglomerate General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report) from Dow 30. Notably, GE will cease to be part of this closely watched index of the U.S. stock markets from Jun 26. The drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) will replace GE in the 30-stock blue-chip index.It is to be noted, the Dow was formed in 1896 and GE is one of the 12 original members of the index. It has been a continuous member since 1907. GE’s removal from the elite Dow 30 index reflects the tectonic shift in prominence of companies in U.S. economy.The traditional industrial and metal companies have taken a backseat in the economy while financials, healthcare, technology and consumer staple and discretionary companies have emerged as the front runners. Both GE and Walgreens carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why GE Gets Booted From Dow 30?GE, the 126 year old industrial conglomerate, has been struggling in several key industrial markets in recent years. The company is aggressively cutting costs and selling businesses. It has even replaced its CEO, slashed thousands of jobs and is unsure about its capability to pay dividend in 2019.In 2017, the stock was the worst performer of the Dow 30 index. It has lost 26% in the first six months of the year and 55% in the past 12 months. Given the fact that the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index, GE’s current stock price of $12.95 represents less than 0.5% of the overall index.The company is now the sixth smallest member of the Dow 30 as per market value, and the lowest in terms of stock price. Consequently, GE bears virtually on influence on the price-weighted Dow 30 index at present.Why has Walgreens Been Selected?As a leading drug store chain, Walgreens will more accurately represent the importance of consumer products and healthcare industries in the U.S. economy. Notably, the consumer staple industry has been one of the worst performers in 2018. The stock price of Walgreen’s is down 11% year to date and declined about 19% over the last 12-months.However, the important fact is that based on the closing price of Jun 19, Walgreens’ shares would rank as the seventh-least-influential within in the Dow 30 while GE was the least influential stock.Consequently, it is likely that Walgreens will outperform GE when fund managers managing Dow 30-based funds will buy shares of Walgreens in order to restructure their funds to reflect the index’s new composition.Will the Change Make Dow 30 More Attractive?According to several industry experts, the Dow 30, the so-called blue-chip index does not exert the same influence as it used to till 1990s. According to Lipper data, nearly $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow 30 while ETFs that tracked the benchmark S&P 500 index received more than $380 billion in investments. Consequently, replacement of GE by Walgreens will not have any influence in the market.However, a closer look will reveal some interesting pictures. The GE/Walgreens replacement will be the first shake-up to the Dow 30 since 2015, when Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) replaced AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report). However, that was a replacement within the technology sector.The GE/Walgreens replacement will reduce the weight of industrial sector within the index and increase the weight of the consumer goods sector. This will change the most important divisor of the Dow 30.Notably, the value of the index is determined by calculating the sum of the share price of its members using the divisor. Consequently, a restructured Dow 30 will more accurately reflect market sentiments.The chart below shows price performance of General Electric and Walgreens year to date.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

608,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 27. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a positive surprise, with loss of 1 cent per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 2 cents. Further, the company has topped estimates in two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate suggests that the company is likely to post break-even results for the quarter under review, against loss of 5 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.35 billion, down 31.2% from the prior-year quarter.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteHowever, Rite Aid’s shares have surged 11.8% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s increase of 1.7%. This could be attributed to the optimism arising from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the pending merger deal with Albertsons. Clearly, there is positive momentum for the stock, ahead of the fiscal first-quarter earnings release. Factors at PlayRite Aid stock is witnessing an increase due to positive developments such as its recent merger deal with grocer Albertsons Companies. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the calendar year 2018. Moreover, Rite Aid’s efforts to boost market share through wellness remodeling and other strategic initiatives bode well. The company remodeled 38 outlets and relocated six stores in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. As of Mar 3, 2017, it had 1,805 wellness stores.Furthermore, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, Rite Aid outlined a robust initial view for fiscal 2019. The company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement rate environment compared with fiscal 2018, and TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal along with other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies.The company estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated to be flat to up 1%. Further, the company expects adjusted net income per share of 2-6 cents compared with loss of 2 cents per share reported in fiscal 2018.However, the company’s dismal past performances, particularly the top line, remain concerns. Though its bottom-line results surpassed estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, sales lagged for the third straight quarter. Moreover, both earnings and sales dropped year over year. While the bottom-line beat was attributed to the improvement in reimbursement rates, it declined year over year due to the fall in adjusted EBITDA, higher Walgreens deal-related costs along with increased lease termination and impairment charges. Further, sales dipped on account of soft comps as well as the decline in revenues at Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments.Though the company’s future prospects look bright, owing to the pending acquisition, solid fiscal 2019 outlook and other strategies, we remain a little skeptical about the near-term performance due to the company’s dismal past trends.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. While the company’s Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.

609,WBA,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of Health Canada approval for the new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for respiratory virus infections.The Panther Fusion respiratory assays include the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV, Panther Fusion Paraflu and Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV tests. Further, these PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based assays offer a highly-advanced approach to syndromic testing via the ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient’s specimen, based on the patient’s requirements.According to the company, these new assays, when combined with the Aptima transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assays, enable the Panther Fusion system — as the only instrument — to combine TMA, real-time TMA and real-time PCR with full sample to result automation.Notably, the Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the original Panther instrument. Apart from the Panther platform’s existing benefits, this new system adds flexibility of PCR to the proven performance of TMA, used by the Panther system.Further, as a result of this new system, certain additional benefits like increased flexibility, enhanced time and cost efficiency will also be obtained by laboratories.Per the company, regulatory approval was also obtained for three new assays for flu and respiratory infections. This extended the variety of diagnostic tests, capable of being run on the Hologic system.Market ProspectsPer CISION, the molecular diagnostics market is projected to reach $10.12 billion at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2016 to 2021. Considering this huge market potential, we believe, the company’s latest development is quite strategic.Hologic is consistently trying to expand its Diagnostic segment, which generated 35.4% of total revenues in the last reported quarter, despite facing a year-over-year decline of 5.5%. Under this segment, Molecular Diagnostics revenues increased 6.1% (4.4% at constant exchange rate).Stock Performance SolidOver the past three months, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 6.4% against the 12.7% decline of the industry. Recent Regulatory Approvals at a GlanceRecently, Hologic announced the receipt of medical device license, issued by Health Canada, to distribute Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, for treating the back, inner and outer thighs, and submental area.Moreover, the company announced that the FDA has granted premarket approval (PMA) for the ThinPrep Integrated Imager, which will make automated imaging of Pap tests broadly available to laboratories and cytologists in the United States in April.The company's Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology have also received PMA approval from the U.S. FDA and are now available on the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.Again, in January, Hologic announced that FDA has granted PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully-automated Panther system.Its Cynosure division also announced the launch of TempSure Envi in the same month. This is an FDA-cleared advanced radiofrequency device that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite.We believe this recent spree of regulatory approvals for the company’s array of products is going to boost the share price further.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). While Illumina and Amedisys sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

610,WBA,"Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past six months, the company’s share price has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 62.9% compared with 13.5% growth recorded by the industry. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 3.8% increase.This renowned home health and hospice services provider has a market cap of $2.85 billion. The company’s five-year projected growth rate is favorable at 18.6% compared with the industry’s 14.4%.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment. The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, eight analysts revised their estimates upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. Resultantly, earnings estimates increased around 3.7% to $3.11 per share.Per our Style Score, Amedisys sports a Growth Score of A, which is reflective of the company’s strong prospects. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Strategic BuyoutsAmedisys is developing and acquiring business lines that will complement its existing home care and hospice business. Over the past year, the company made a number of strategic acquisitions — the recent one being that of East Tennessee Personal Care Service (ETPCS), a personal care provider, headquartered in Knoxville, TN. According to Amedisys, this buyout will expand the company’s personal-care footprint outside of Massachusetts and Florida.Currently, management expects the company to have enough cash balance for making a number of acquisitions in the future.Favorable 2018 Home Health Final RuleAccording to a report by HEALTHCAREfirst, the decision on 2018 Home Health Final Rule was taken without the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) scheduled for rollout in 2019. Amedisys is optimistic about the implementation of this rule and expects this to positively impact the business in the future.Personal Care Prospects AttractiveRecently, Amedisys integrated a new operating segment within its business — Personal Care. Per management, this segment is stabilizing and performing as per the company’s expectation as it integrates recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company is looking forward to huge growth prospects within this segment. With the Intercity acquisition, it has closed and successfully integrated two personal care acquisitions and completed the buyout of East Tennessee Personal Care Services in February 2018. Moreover, the company is working on expanding the geographical presence of the Personal Care business.Favorable Demographic TrendsThe home health industry is poised for tremendous growth in the long term, driven by the aging U.S. population, patients’ desire for independence and home health as a cheaper care modality. The company should continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and the need for higher acuity patients to be taken care of in a home nursing environment.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

611,WBA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Walgreens Boots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Walgreens Boots’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 11.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is a little undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Walgreens Boots has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Walgreens Boots stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Walgreens Boots has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, WBA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Walgreens Boots currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Walgreens Boots a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Walgreens Boots might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C. This gives WBA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upper, while the full year estimate has seen no significant estimate revisions the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate remained stable. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and Consensus  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and Consensus | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWalgreens Boots is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 27% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

617,WBA,"On Mar 23, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, which is expected to benefit the company over the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing company has outperformed the broader industry over the last 30 days. The stock has declined 5.4% compared with the broader industry’s 7.3% decrease.  Ahead of Walgreens Boots’ second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on Mar 28, 2018, we are upbeat about the company’s strength in its Retail Pharmacy USA division and the continued prescription growth on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume expansion from the previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.We are also particularly encouraged by the revised Rite Aid store deal, which has received a regulatory approval last September. Per Walgreens Boots, the modified buyout contract will help it boost the top line and gain operational benefits. It will also aid the company to expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets including the Northeast. Notably, a chain of stores and three distribution centers are on the company’s purchase list. While the stores are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, the distribution centers are founded in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, SC. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years.Moreover, increase in Retail Pharmacy International sales buoys optimism. Additionally, we are hopeful about the company’s decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China. This should in fact provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Also, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell a portion of its investment in the Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for a huge amount of cash is a major positive.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain traction from its growth initiatives, major mass merchants are flourishing pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. An escalated reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation too have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

618,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Mar 28.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.79%. It is noteworthy that Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.43%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsOver the recent past, we have observed Walgreens Boots’ Retail Pharmacy USA division to witness comparable prescription growth and benefit from strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market.Meanwhile, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company exceeded 1 billion scripts on a 30-day adjusted and rolling annual basis for the first time, touching a new milestone.Furthermore, the company’s efforts to boost its digital capabilities have started paying off. In this regard, more than 20% of the company’s retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels with the Walgreens' mobile app, having been downloaded in excess of 50 million times since the launch.We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Furthermore, the company has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Meanwhile, strong market growth in certain emerging markets drove the company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale division’s solid performance in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. We expect these trends to get reflected in fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $31.99 billion reflects an 8.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, we are upbeat about the company expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (""CNPGC"").Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in its Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for huge cash returns buoys optimism.We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ plans to expand its existing group purchasing efforts with Express Scripts Holding Company, to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs. Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs, the move is considered to be a prudent and timely one.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots’ gross margin figures continued to contract in the last reported quarter as well. Lower pharmacy margins in the U.K., reflecting the reduction in funding, led to the downside. However, the company is working tirelessly to increase efficiency and provide high quality and cost-effective pharmacy services, in order to reduce overall pharmacy cost.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Walgreens Boots is +2.46%.

Among its recent alliances, under the new agreement with Interpace Diagnostics, Dianon Pathology — a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group — will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis.This apart, worth mentioning are the company’s two major health systems partnerships, Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, a market-leading reference and outreach laboratory based in Pacific Northwest.

620,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 29. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported break-even bottom-line results that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents per share. Further, the company has topped estimates in two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, against the break-even results reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.54 billion, down 34.9% from the prior-year quarter.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation Quote Further, Rite Aid’s shares have declined by a significant 26.3% in the past month, wider than the industry’s decline of 6.2%. This suggests a negative sentiment for the stock, ahead of fourth-quarter earnings release. Factors at PlayRite Aid remains on track with the transferring of stores and related assets to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) in a phased manner. So far, the company has transferred 1,651 stores and related assets to Walgreens, generating net cash proceeds of $3.6 billion. This will be used to pay down debt and strengthen liquidity position.Further, the company has agreed to merge with grocer Albertsons to fend off the rising competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Moreover, Rite Aid’s efforts to boost market share through wellness remodels and other strategic initiatives bode well.However, Rite Aid is grappling with dismal top-line trends in recent quarters.  Notably, Rite Aid has delivered negative sales surprise in four of the trailing six quarters due to soft comps as well as a decline in revenues at key business segments. Additionally, third-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its third straight quarter of year-over-year sales decline. Sales have declined 4.9%, 4.4% and 5.6%, respectively, in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2018. Rite Aid’s revenues continue to be hurt by soft comps as well as a decline in revenues at key business segments — Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services.Retail Pharmacy segment, which engages in selling prescription drugs, health and beauty products, and personal care items, reported revenue declines of 4.9%, 3.4% and 3% in the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. The segment revenues were persistently hurt by soft same-store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Notably, unfavorable reimbursement rates have been a challenge for the company’s top-line for nearly two years now.Meanwhile, revenues for the Pharmacy Services segment, which provides PBM (pharmacy benefit management) services and a range of pharmacy-related services, dropped 5.6%, 8.7% and 12.2% for the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. Revenues at the Pharmacy Services segment declined due to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions and a fall in commercial business.Rite Aid’s comps dropped 2.5% in third-quarter, which can be attributed to the fall in pharmacy and front-end sales. Notably, its comps have declined for six straight quarters now, reporting declines of 3.9% and 3.4%, respectively, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. Moreover, comps dipped 2.5%, 3.4% and 3% in the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Though we remain a little skeptical about the company’s performance in the fourth quarter, let’s wait and see what’s really in store for the company.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.19% and a Zacks Rank #2.

621,WBA,"With underperforming stores, cancellation of dividends and continued bottom-line loses, Fred's, Inc.’s  troubles have been aggravating and denting its business for a while. However, to cater to consumers’ rapidly changing preferences and sustain market competition, the company has been focusing on pharmacy organization for driving scripts into its stores.  Additionally, it has been putting much effort to reduce operating expenses.Let’s take a look into the factors that have been bruising this discount retailer and discuss the growth plans it has put into place for achieving recovery.Factors Denting the StockFred’s comps have long been ailing from store closures, thanks to receding store traffic.  To top it, comps have also been bearing the brunt of continued increase in generic dispensing rate and sale of low productive discontinued inventory. Persistent challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have also affected overall sales figures. Due to these downsides, comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting business. Incidentally, the company has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters.Moreover, the company’s business expansion plans were eclipsed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. If the deal were to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). However, obstacles such as antitrust concerns cancelled the deal and kept Fred’s far behind industry leaders.To make matters worse, management announced the cancellation of dividend alongside a dismal third quarter results. In combination, all such factors have gravely affected the company’s price performance. The stock has lost 80% in the past year, against the industry’s rally of 15%.Can Efforts Revive Performance?Fred’s strives to improve store traffic and has accordingly shifted focus to pharmacy organization. This is likely to drive scripts into its stores and improve services for patients. Fred’s Retail Pharmacy business seems to be stable, benefiting from the company’s shift to profitable generic prescriptions. In order to improve retail pharmacy business, the company has been expanding flu shots capacity along with aggressive inventory management and marketing initiatives.Further, management continues to build momentum in the Specialty Pharmacy business through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology. Owing to such efforts, the company expects its specialty business to gain access to 5 million new patients across different markets in the forthcoming periods. Additionally, such efforts position the company for new drug introductions, improve data flow and thereby increase efficiency in patient care.Fred’s also initiated several measures for reducing excess inventory and improving technology to better manage product-life cycle. During the third quarter, the company witnessed a turnaround in its tobacco business as well as improved sales of its beer and cosmetics businesses. Further, the company expects improved trends in these categories in the forthcoming periods.Along with strengthening pharmacy operations, expense reduction is also listed amongst Fred’s efforts to achieve profitability. During the third quarter, management successfully reduced selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by 7% to $133.4 million. Further, management expects lower SG&A costs to help augment free cash flows. The company expects to pass the gains from the reduced cost structure to its customers and drive store traffic. Moreover, management plans to allocate funds derived from the cancelled dividend toward curtailing debt load, buyback shares and undertake other corporate initiatives.With such prospective endeavors in place, all is not gloomy for this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) stock and we can still hope for its revival from the shambles. We hope that such dedicated efforts will help the company to uplift investors’ confidence in the stock in the long run.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections.

Further, the new company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.Albertsons currently operates about 2,300 supermarket stores and nearly 1,800 pharmacies. Meanwhile, Rite Aid has 2,569 drug stores in operation, following the sale of 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) for $4.38 billion.Together, the new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger has been approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.Industry Background & Threat of AmazonMajority of the recent consolidation in the grocery and drugstore industries has been trying to fend off rising competition due to the entry of Amazon in these segments. While Amazon’s entry in the grocery industry was marked by the recent acquisition of Whole Foods, the company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) forming a non-profit company providing healthcare solutions to its employees. This has perked up the drugstore industry’s concerns regarding the e-commerce giant’s entry in the healthcare business.Further, this threat comes at a time when the drug industry is dealing with challenges like weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. As the industry players look to cut down costs, the industry continues to witness soft traffic and sales at front-end stores for the last several years. The consequences of these challenges are clearly visible in Rite Aid’s tepid profits in the last two years.A few more instances of recent consolidation in the drugstore industry are CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018, as well as Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.More Stock News: This is Bigger Than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

625,WBA,"Per a report in The Wall Street Journal, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is in early-stage talks to buy the remaining stake in the leading pharmaceutical services company, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Soon after the takeover rumor surfaced on Feb 12, shares of AmerisourceBergen gained 15.7% in after-hours trading and subsequently, closed with a 0.3% rise. However, the stock price of Walgreens remained unchanged.In this regard, we remind investors that the drugstore retailer and pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise already holds a 26% stake in AmerisourceBergen, which is part of their long-term strategic relationship, formed in 2013. That relationship comprises a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote We believe, Walgreen’s latest decision to acquire AmerisourceBergen’s remaining stake, comes close on the heels of its rival CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) gigantic $69-billion acquisition deal of health insurer, Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report). According to a Reuters report, the Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen integration, similar to the CVS-Aetna deal, is likely to move toward a vertical consolidation, combining all members of a supply chain.This apart, some analysts believe that this move may be in response to Amazon’s latest decision to step into the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Notably, in December 2017, Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) had acquired pharmacy licenses in a dozen states.As far as the news revolving around Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen agreement is concerned, many market researchers view this takeover rumor to be strategic, although the companies themselves have remained silent on this speculative issue.Significantly, Walgreens has a market capitalization of $67.82 billion while the same for AmerisourceBergen remains at $19.65 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

626,WBA,"On Jan 22, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing company has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has gained 14.5% in comparison to the broader industry’s 9.1%.Walgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the strength in the Retail Pharmacy USA division and the continued prescription growth on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.We are particularly upbeat about the revised Rite Aid store deal for which the company received regulatory approval last September. Per Walgreens Boots, the modified buyout contract will help it boost the top line and also gain operational benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the three distribution centers to be bought are located in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA; and Spartanburg, SC. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years.  Moreover, increase in Retail Pharmacy International sales buoys optimism. Also, we are upbeat about the company’s decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China. This should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for a huge amount of cash is a major positive.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain traction, major mass merchants are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Moreover, over the last few years, slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys (AMED  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25%.Amedisys has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 18.5%.

627,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is on track with the process of transferring stores and related assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) under its amended and restated asset purchase agreement. Per the agreement, Walgreens will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of around $4.375 billion. The company is carrying out the transfer of assets in a phased manner.As of Jan 22, 2018, Rite Aid has transferred 625 stores and related assets to Walgreens, generating net cash proceeds of $1,309.8 million. The company has used these proceeds to pay off its entire $970 million in outstanding secured loans. This has helped it to strengthen liquidity position. Further, the company expects to complete the transfer process by spring 2018.The company stated that majority of the closing conditions for the sale have been met, and only few conditions need to be satisfied for the remaining transfer of stores. Going forward, Rite Aid expects to smoothly complete the transfer process. Simultaneously, it remains focused on identifying new opportunities to strengthen business and providing a great experience to customers and patients, which should also enhance shareholder value.Is Transfer of Stores Aiding Stock Price?Rite Aid has been witnessing an uptrend in its share price since completing the pilot closing and the first transfer of 97 Rite Aid stores and related assets in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Notably, the stock has gained 29.1% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.6%. Moreover, the company has witnessed significant upside in the past month with shares surging as much as 14.9%.What’s Bothering Investors?While the upside in stock price is surely boosting investors’ view, we are looking for more positives to become confident on the stock. Particularly, the company’s dismal top-line trends due to unfavorable reimbursement rates and soft same store sales, keep us on the sidelines. Moreover, revenues at the Pharmacy Services segment , which provides PBM (pharmacy benefit management) services, continues to be soft due to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions and fall in commercial business. Consequently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Where is Rite Aid Heading?Rite Aid’s rescue to the biggest challenge of unfavorable reimbursement rates lies in the aforementioned sale of stores and assets to Walgreens. The company’s smaller size after the sale of these assets is likely to reduce Rite Aid’s exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates. However, the real outcome will be evident only after all the stores are transferred to Walgreens.Further, the company anticipates its Pharmacy Services segment to gain traction in coming days as it plans to promote the PBM business, which it manages through Envision Rx that was acquired in 2015. Notably, the company grew Envision Rx's Medicare Part D membership by more than 100,000 lives to 500,000 lives in the past year.Going forward, the company expects Envision to drive growth across the board, as it targets increasing its customer base by 100,000 customers into fiscal 2019. Additionally, the company’s Health Dialog and RediClinic businesses are likely to aid health and wellness scores, which should improve overall performance.Still Interested in Retail?

(AEO  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Diplomat Pharmacy has advanced 22.3% in the past month.

628,WBA,"Thursday, June 28, 2018Market futures are again pointing lower ahead of the opening bell, though not precipitously. General indigestion regarding trade tensions persist, though at this hour we’re not seeing anything to pitch stocks significantly in either direction, with the possible exception of an inauspicious debut of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.New Initial Jobless Claims hit the tape as they do every Thursday morning, posting a headline of 227K following the previous week’s unrevised 218K. This marks the first week in the past 5 that initial claims have been higher than 225K, which in previous years during our domestic economic recovery appeared to be the absolute bottom. But with the Trump economy freeing up billions in lower corporate taxes, along with pent-up demand in Construction and Manufacturing, we’ve actually found a range below that, and aside from a couple weeks like this most recent one, have resided there for the past couple months.Continuing claims, on the other hand, kept its steady dwindling as the labor market approaches peak strength: from 1.726 million the previous week to 1.705 million this week, we remain in awe-inspiring territory consistent with our historically strong employment situation. It wasn’t too long ago we mused over how great it would be for continuing claims to post beneath 2 million per week; those days look far behind us from this vista.The second revision on Q1 2018 GDP came in a tad disappointing this morning: 2.0% is 20 basis points beneath the first revision, which itself was below the 2.3% initially reported. Keep in mind this is still the seasonally slower initial 3 months of the year, following the holiday season and in the dead of winter. Even still, with such robust economic numbers coming through year-to-date, this does seem to be somewhat of a let-down.For the good news, simply take these GDP figures and point them toward the initial read on Q2, which we expect next month. Analysts’ consensus are looking for 3%+ growth for the second 3 months of the year, with the Atlanta Fed expecting an eye-popping 4.7% growth, which would be the highest we’ve seen since Q2 2014, before the supply glut in the global oil & gas industry sent prices into a tailspin.Walgreens shares are down 9% this morning, helping plummet Dow futures just as the pharma and goods retailer stumbles onto the index. Yet the company outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines for its May-ended fiscal Q3 report, with $1.53 per share on $34.33 billion topping the $1.47 per share and $33.65 billion, respectively. Same-store sales disappointed in the quarter, however. Guidance was not raised on the top end for fiscal 2018, though it was ratcheted up on the bottom end of the range. For more on WBA’s earnings, click here.Perhaps we also see negative sentiment for Walgreens based on news this morning that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is buying its way into the retail pharma space, announcing the purchase of online pharma service company PillPack. This private firm, founded in 2013, pre-sorts prescriptions and delivers them to patients’ homes. Terms for the acquisition have not been made public at this hour, though the synergies with Amazon’s Prime service are fairly obvious.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

631,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is progressing well with the transfer of stores and related assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), under its amended and restated asset purchase agreement. As of Mar 2, 2018, the company has transferred a total of 1,651 stores and related assets to Walgreens.Rite Aid received net sale proceeds of $3.6 billion in cash owing to the transfer of 1,651 stores. With these cash proceeds, management has been lowering debt, thus solidifying its liquidity position. Further, the company expects to complete the transfer process by spring 2018.Per the agreement, Walgreens will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of $4.4 billion. The company is carrying out the transfer of assets in a phased manner.Notably, the majority of the closing conditions for the deal have been met and only few conditions need to be satisfied for the remaining transfer of stores. Moving ahead, Rite Aid expects to smoothly complete the transfer process.Earlier, management had stated that following the closure of the deal with Walgreens more than 70% of Rite Aid’s network will include wellness and customer world outlets. These outlets combined with the ongoing development of the company’s wellness stores form a major part of Rite Aid’s short-term and long-term strategic plans.Simultaneously, the company remains focused on identifying new opportunities to strengthen business and provide a great experience to customers and patients, which should also enhance shareholder value.In a recent development, Rite Aid agreed to merge forces with the country’s largest grocer Albertsons Companies. Per the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares. For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.In fact, this deal is considered as Albertsons’ and Rite Aid’s latest effort to dispel the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). These positives have brought about a significant turnaround in Rite Aid’s stock price.

632,WBA,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%)greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years with a VGM Score of B. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.

(LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of A. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 20% for 3-5 years.Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report), a discount retailer, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years currently stands at 11.6%.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

633,WBA,"Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) are down 16.5% over the last year based mostly on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears. There is no doubt that online selling and delivery have altered the retail world, but does that mean Walgreens can no longer compete? Let’s dive into some of WBA’s fundamentals to see what to do with the stock.Amazon ThreatAmazon is set to acquire online and delivery pharmacy startup PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack’s co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The late June announcement sent shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens tumbling. But the question is, how quickly can Amazon infiltrate the industry with a pharmacy firm that boasted just tens of thousands of customers? Walgreens alone claims 13,200 stores in 11 countries, with whole distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000 pharmacies—as of August 2017.Amazon does already sell its own private-brand, over-the-counter drugs, called Basic Care, selling 65 drugs at costs that were roughly 20% less than Walgreens and CVS. Yet, Amazon is far from overtaking the approximately $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry.Investors should also note that fears the e-commerce giant would destroy the grocery industry have been largely overblown to this point as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have adapted to the times and pushed out their own online portals, delivery options, and meal-kits. The pharmaceutical and drug industry is much different than the grocery business, for an array of reasons, but Walgreens and others are just as capable of fighting back against Amazon’s pharmaceutical invasion.In fact, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said on a conference call that his company is “not particularly worried” about Amazon’s PillPack acquisition. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages,” he continued. “I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Recent NewsWalgreens reported strong fiscal third-quarter results on June 28, topping Wall Street estimates and posting solid year-over-year gains. The company is also upbeat about its purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores.Furthermore, Walgreens is ramping up its delivery, and currently offers an array of shipping and delivery options. Meanwhile, just last week, it announced that its 40% acquisition of a leading retail Chinese pharmacy chain, Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co, was approved—which could prove to be a great investment. And the company recently introduced a new $10 billion share repurchase program that helps indicate its focus on driving long-term stockholder value, and that its stock price looks pretty cheap at the moment.Price Movement & ValuationShares of WBA are up 88% over the last 10 years, which falls below the S&P 500’s 128% climb. And over the last three years, Walgreens has seen its stock price tumble 31%, with a 14% decline in the last three months alone. With that said, shares of WBA sit roughly $20 below their 52-week high of $83.89. This means Walgreens stock is relatively inexpensive at face value.Diving a little deeper, investors will note that Walgreens presents rather strong value at the moment. WBA is currently trading at 9.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a substantial discount compared to its industry’s 16.2X average. Furthermore, Walgreens stock has traded as high as 23.3X over the last year, with a one-year median of 15.8X. Walgreens stock is also trading almost directly in line with its year-long low, which is its lowest earnings multiple over the last five years. Therefore investors should be able to say with some confidence that WBA appears rather cheap at its current level. Outlook Walgreens is also expected to continue to experience strong top and bottom line growth. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for its quarterly revenues to climb by over 11% to hit $33.51 billion. The company’s top line is expected to expand by 10.8% to touch $131.02 billion for its current fiscal year.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Walgreens is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings pop by 10.7% to reach $1.45 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 17% to reach $5.97.Bottom LineWalgreens is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. With all that said, WBA looks like it might be worth considering at the moment based on its outstanding valuation picture and growth outlook.Lastly, investors should expect Walgreens to adapt in order to better compete going forward. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 2.8%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

634,WBA,"Market futures are again pointing lower ahead of the opening bell, though not precipitously. General indigestion regarding trade tensions persist, though at this hour we’re not seeing anything to pitch stocks significantly in either direction, with the possible exception of an inauspicious debut of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.New Initial Jobless Claims hit the tape as they do every Thursday morning, posting a headline of 227K following the previous week’s unrevised 218K. This marks the first week in the past 5 that initial claims have been higher than 225K, which in previous years during our domestic economic recovery appeared to be the absolute bottom. But with the Trump economy freeing up billions in lower corporate taxes, along with pent-up demand in Construction and Manufacturing, we’ve actually found a range below that, and aside from a couple weeks like this most recent one, have resided there for the past couple months.Continuing claims, on the other hand, kept its steady dwindling as the labor market approaches peak strength: from 1.726 million the previous week to 1.705 million this week, we remain in awe-inspiring territory consistent with our historically strong employment situation. It wasn’t too long ago we mused over how great it would be for continuing claims to post beneath 2 million per week; those days look far behind us from this vista.The second revision on Q1 2018 GDP came in a tad disappointing this morning: 2.0% is 20 basis points beneath the first revision, which itself was below the 2.3% initially reported. Keep in mind this is still the seasonally slower initial 3 months of the year, following the holiday season and in the dead of winter. Even still, with such robust economic numbers coming through year-to-date, this does seem to be somewhat of a let-down.For the good news, simply take these GDP figures and point them toward the initial read on Q2, which we expect next month. Analysts’ consensus are looking for 3%+ growth for the second 3 months of the year, with the Atlanta Fed expecting an eye-popping 4.7% growth, which would be the highest we’ve seen since Q2 2014, before the supply glut in the global oil & gas industry sent prices into a tailspin.Walgreens shares are down 9% this morning, helping plummet Dow futures just as the pharma and goods retailer stumbles onto the index. Yet the company outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines for its May-ended fiscal Q3 report, with $1.53 per share on $34.33 billion topping the $1.47 per share and $33.65 billion, respectively.Same-store sales disappointed in the quarter, however. Guidance was not raised on the top end for fiscal 2018, though it was ratcheted up on the bottom end of the range. For more on WBA’s earnings, click here.Perhaps we also see negative sentiment for Walgreens based on news this morning that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is buying its way into the retail pharma space, announcing the purchase of online pharma service company PillPack. This private firm, founded in 2013, pre-sorts prescriptions and delivers them to patients’ homes. Terms for the acquisition have not been made public at this hour, though the synergies with Amazon’s Prime service are fairly obvious.

635,WBA,"Over the last few months, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) (popularly known as LabCorp) has been dominating headlines on several developments including strategic partnerships and divestments. Following the company’s laboratory collaboration with Appalachian Regional Healthcare and Mount Sinai, it has formed one more joint venture, this time with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report).In fact, this is the renewal of both entities’ long-term strategic partnership to create more simplified and personalized care recommendations for 48 million people enrolled in UnitedHealthcare plans. Per UnitedHealth, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider until Jan 1, 2019. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.  Notably, as part of the expanding relationship, both companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. This alliance will help bringing advanced lab services in accountable care arrangements between UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals plus 110,000 physicians.Progress on Strategic CollaborationsSignificantly, LabCorp has fortified its footprint in the diagnostics space through both organic and inorganic means plus plans to coordinate with leading companies and academic institutions to build a wider portfolio of tests.The company continues to increase its scale and competencies in clinical laboratory medicine via acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing. Among its recent associations, LabCorp has formed one multi-year, comprehensive laboratory teamwork with Appalachian Regional Healthcare. Also, under the new agreement with Interpace Diagnostics, Dianon Pathology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, the company will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis.Additionally, worth mentioning are the company’s two major health systems partnerships, Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, respectively. PAML is a Pacific Northwest-based market-leading reference and outreach laboratory. Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually emerge as research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator besides patient recruitment capabilities.Other recent coalitions include a strategic partnership with Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report), which enabled the launch of Thermo Fisher Oncomine Dx target panel for non-small cell lung cancer patients. Also, Labcorp works on developing and operating patient service centers within select Walgreens stores, courtesy of its drug retailer Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report). This apart, the company has an important tie-up with Japan-based Sysmex Corporation, a foremost clinical laboratory services provider and Roche, the world's reputed biotech company.Share Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of LabCorp have outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 0.4% against the industry’s 3.7% decline.LabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

636,WBA,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced on Thursday that it had officially narrowed the list of candidates for its second headquarters down to 20, eliminating the vast majority of the reported 238 applicants and brining the remaining cities one step closer to the 50,000 jobs promised by the e-commerce behemoth.Not surprisingly, Amazon’s shortlist includes several locations in the Midwest and South and on the East Coast. The list shies away from tech-heavy West Coast hubs, but it does include one major Californian metropolitan area. Here’s a snapshot of the finalists’ locations:(Credit: Amazon.com)“Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals. Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s head of economic development, in a press release. “Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.”Amazon provided no further details on why each city was selected, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria announced at the beginning of the search, which included a metropolitan area of more than one million and an ability to attract top technical talent.  Company officials will now work more directly with finalist cites. Amazon is expected to select a winner later this year. It is unclear exactly how the next phase of this process will look for these local governments, but judging by the very public displays many put on during the application process, it should be entertaining at the least.It will also be interesting to see whether local businesses step up their marketing efforts. The announcement of Amazon’s shortlist brings our attention to the “secret” winners of HQ2—potential partner corporations that will benefit from having Amazon as a neighbor without having to foot the bill for the company’s sure-to-be lavish demands.One example would be Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report), an open-source software and enterprise IT company based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon’s Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings. Raleigh hits on several other key requirements, including its close proximity to top schools like Duke and UNC, but the presence of Red Hat is almost certainly a factorSeveral other locations look attractive for strategic reasons. Whole Foods Market, the organic grocery chain Amazon shelled out $14 billion for last year, is headquartered in downtown Austin, Texas. Bringing HQ2 to Austin could mean that Amazon wants the new location to be the center of its budding grocery business.We also know that Amazon has reportedly considered expanding into pharmacy operations. Well, Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) is based in Deerfield, Illinois—less than an hour outside of shortlist city Chicago. Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) is headquartered about two hours away from Philadelphia, while CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) finds itself slightly over an hour’s drive from Boston.There is no indication that Amazon is interested in working directly with any of these companies, let alone willing to move HQ2 to a nearby city in order to make that partnership work. And in today’s world, one would hardly need to be located near another business to join forces on a specific project.But proximity still matters to some, and it will be interesting to see whether any of these brands open their arms to Amazon—or reject the company’s advances altogether.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware, which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

637,WBA,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

638,WBA,"Fred’s Inc.  confirmed sale of certain assets of its specialty pharmacy business, EntrustRx, to CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The company has been considering the divesture of its specialty pharmacy unit for a while, in a bid to monetize non-core assets, reduce debt load and induce a turnaround in its operations. Per the terms, Fred’s is entitled to receive $40 million along with a sum equivalent to EntrustRx’s inventory value. The transaction is expected to close by May-end, upon approval of customary closing conditions.Further, this latest move by Fred’s seems to have perked up investors’ optimism in the stock. Evidently, the stock moved up 2.1% in yesterday’s trading session. Let’s now delve into this development and see how Fred’s is expected to benefit from it.The Significance of the DivestitureFred’s has been grappling with dismal comparable-store sales performance since many quarters, due to lower traffic, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and persistent increase in generic dispensing rate. Although the company made investments in sales teams, therapy diversification and technology upgradations to revive its pharmacy business, it failed to uplift performance. To make matters worse, the company’s attempt to improve its pharmacy business performance was crushed by the cancelled Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. The deal could not make its way through regulatory hurdles, which marred Fred’s store expansion plans.   Amid such headwinds, Fred’s has long been exploring strategic alternatives for its pharmacy business and revive itself. Indeed, the company seems to have struck the right chords with its latest deal with CVS Health. The divestiture is expected to provide a relief to Fred’s ailing business by vending off some of its dismally performing business units and concentrate more on other prospective areas.  In fact, management of Fred’s also stated that the cash proceeds from this divestiture will enable the company to strengthen its financial position by reducing debt load.Apart from this, Fred’s has also been exploring opportunities to augment its retail pharmacy operations. The company is committed toward undertaking strategic transactions, improving cost structure and capital allocation, optimizing assortments, undertaking talent acquisition and efforts to drive revenues and margins. Notably, management foresees cost-savings opportunities of $30-$40 million for fiscal 2018, backed by the aforementioned efforts and initiatives to lower SKU count. We expect that such well-chalked strategies will aid the company to uplift its stock performance in the long run that has declined almost 64% over the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 16.4%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

639,WBA,"Fred’s Inc.  released fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line deteriorated year on year. Shares of the company lost 6.3% on May 4, following the dismal performance.In fact, the company has lost almost 89% in a year, as against the industry’s 17.3% growth. This is largely attributable to Fred’s dismal comps and earnings record, as well as the impact of the canceled merger between Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report)   and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report). The canceled deal thwarted Fred’s store expansion plans and kept it behind industry leaders like Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).  Q4 HighlightsThe discount retailer posted adjusted loss of 62 cents per share from continuing operations, which was wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 58 cents.Quarterly net sales climbed 2.1% year over year to $477.3 million. Sales in this quarter gained from an additional week this year, compared to the year-ago period.Comps slipped 0.9% in the quarter, while it was narrower than a 4.8% dip witnessed in the year-ago quarter.The company’s gross profit tumbled 8% year over year to $115.1 million. Further, gross margin contracted 280 basis points to 24.1%, mainly accountable to the Front Store business. This in turn was hurt by unfavorable mix and markdowns on clearance inventory.Fred’s posted an adjusted operating loss (or EBITDA) of $18.9 million in the reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago quarter, when the company posted adjusted operating earnings of $13 million. During the quarter, management successfully reduced adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales) by 230 bps to 28.4%.Financial UpdateFred’s ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $6,573 million, long-term portion of indebtedness of $167.1 million and shareholders' equity of roughly $181 million.Store UpdateFred’s currently operates 600 pharmacy and general merchandise stores. These include 12 franchised locations along with three additional specialty pharmacy-only locations.Looking AheadManagement is on track with turnaround strategies focusing mainly toward delivering considerable enhancing free cash flow and removing debt load. The company remains committed toward undertaking strategic transactions, improving cost structure and capital allocation, optimizing assortments, undertaking talent acquisition and efforts to drive revenues and margins. Notably, management foresees cost savings opportunities of $30-$40 million for fiscal 2018, backed by the aforementioned efforts and initiatives to lower SKU count.With regard to strategic transactions, the company revealed that it is already on track to sell its specialty pharmacy business and some parts of its huge portfolio. In fact, the specialty pharmacy business now forms part of discontinued operations.

641,WBA,"Investors are keeping a close watch on Fred’s Inc.  as the discount retailer is gearing up to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. However, there are two things investors must note before they take a stock of the results. Firstly, Fred’s has rescheduled its earnings announcement date, and the second thing to note is why the company took this step.Well, Fred’s revealed that its fourth-quarter earnings are now slated to be reported on May 4, which will be followed by management’s conference call. Management clarified that this postponement is solely connected to Fred’s plans to divest its specialty pharmacy business, which will soon form part of the company’s discontinued operations.Notably, these revelations spurred investors’ sentiment, as shares of the company gained a solid 13.3% during yesterday’s trading session. This gave a major respite to the stock that was otherwise in the red zone for a while. Incidentally, Fred’s has lost close to 79% in a year, as against the industry’s rise of nearly 20%. This is largely attributable to Fred’s dismal comps and earnings record, as well as the impact of the canceled merger between Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report). The canceled deal thwarted Fred’s store expansion plans and kept it far behind industry leaders like Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).  Getting back to the latest announcements — we note that during the quarter under review, Fred’s directors sanctioned a plan to undertake rigorous marketing of the company’s specialty pharmacy business. This in turn requires Fred’s to put up the specialty pharmacy operations under discontinued operations for all time periods in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. As management anticipates filing the 10-K on May 4 itself, it is likely to take time to complete the accounting procedures associated with presenting its specialty pharmacy business operations in the discontinued operations section. This in turn caused the company to delay its reporting date from Apr 18 to May 4.We note that in third-quarter fiscal 2017, Fred’s generated more than half of its total sales from its pharmacy business, which comprises the retail pharmacy as well as the specialty pharmacy. However, total pharmacy sales dipped 2.1% year over year, most of which was accountable to softness in retail pharmacy stemming from store closures.In fact, management has long been focused on improving the performance of its specialty pharmacy business through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology. The company has also been leveraging its business relations with payer partners in order to augment network access. These efforts were expected to help Fred’s specialty business gain access to 5 million new patients across different markets. Nevertheless, company’s decision to sell the specialty pharmacy unit looks like a well-perceived move that was also welcomed by Fred’s investors.On that note, let’s wait and see what’s in store for Fred’s this earnings season. The company, along with its subsidiaries operated 597 discount general merchandise stores and three specialties pharmacy-only across 15 states in the southeastern areas of United States.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

642,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) delivered mixed results for first-quarter fiscal 2019, wherein the bottom line lagged estimates while sales topped. Further, the bottom line was flat with the prior-year quarter and the top line declined marginally. It was also the second straight quarter of improved adjusted EBITDA for the Retail Pharmacy segment, which led to increased adjusted EBITDA for the company.Other key highlights of the reported quarter included the transfer of 281 stores to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report), which completed the company’s store transfer process. However, the sale of three distribution centers and related inventory is likely to take place after Sep 1, 2018. With cash proceeds of $268.6 million received in the quarter under review, management considerably lowered its debt position. As a result, its debt (net of cash) was $3 billion as of Jun 2, 2018.Additionally, the company agreed to merge with Albertsons on Feb 20, 2018. The companies expect to close the merger in the second half of the calendar year 2018.Shares of Rite Aid reflected about 1% improvement after reporting a top line beat for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged 17.3% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s increase of 7.1%. The stock’s momentum is mainly attributed to the recent completion of store transfers to Walgreens and the pending merger with Albertsons.Q1 in DetailRite Aid reported adjusted loss per share of 1 cent in first-quarter fiscal 2019, underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even results. It was at par with the year-ago quarter figure. Bottom line results were primarily hurt by an increase in interest expenses, higher lease termination and impairment charges, as well as higher transaction costs. This was partly negated by improved Adjusted EBITDA.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRevenues dropped 0.9% to $5,388.5 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,354 million. During the reported quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues declined 1.9% on account of soft same-store sales and store closures. However, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment rose 2% due to higher Medicare Part D membership.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales dipped 0.7%, owing to 0.1% fall in pharmacy sales and 1.8% decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 133 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Further, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.5% due to the omission of some pharmacy networks from the prior-year quarter. Prescription sales constituted 66.4% of total drugstore sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA improved 8.3% year over year to $147.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 20 bps to 2.7%. Adjusted for fees related to the Walgreens transaction, pro-forma adjusted EBITDA for first-quarter fiscal 2019 was $160 million, reflecting a 17.6% increase year over year. Adjusted EBITDA gained from favorable results for the Retail Pharmacy segment, driven by gross margin growth and efficient cost management. This was partly offset by a decline in the Pharmacy Services segment, due to the fall in commercial business and operating investments to support growth.Store UpdateRite Aid continues to renovate stores, with 49 remodels carried out in the fiscal first quarter. This brings the company’s total wellness-stores count to 1,694. Further, it sold 281 stores to Walgreens and shut 17 stores during the reported quarter, consequently taking the total store count to 2,533 as of Jun 2, 2018.Financial StatusRite Aid ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $147.1 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $3,134.7 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,812.3 million.Further, the company’s cash, used in operating activities, was $16.3 million as of Jun 2, 2018.OutlookBased on the expected gains from more stable reimbursement rates compared with fiscal 2018, TSA fees related to the WBA deal, generic drug purchasing efficiencies, and other initiatives to drive sales growth and operational efficiencies, Rite Aid reiterated its initial guidance for fiscal 2019. However, the company’s guidance does not include any impact of the pending transaction with Albertsons.Rite Aid estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019, with comps anticipated in the range of flat-to-up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $615-$675 million. Further, the company expects net loss of $40-$95 million in fiscal 2019. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be 2-6 cents compared with loss per share of 2 cents reported in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it expects capital expenditure of nearly $250 million in fiscal 2019.Still Interested in Retail Space? Check TheseInvestors can count on some better-ranked stocks like Herbalife Ltd.

646,WBA,"There is a lot of momentum building around the Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) stock lately, mostly due to its merger deal with grocer Albertsons Companies Inc. Moreover, the company has done a commendable job, reducing its exposure by selling stores and assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). This sale has also helped the company to considerably curb its debt burden with the proceeds from the sale.As a result, investors have shown renewed interest in the stock, which has picked up 5% in the last three months, reflecting tremendous growth compared with the industry’s 0.3% increase. Further, this also represented a marked recovery when compared with the stock’s slump of 28.7% in the past year.However, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty that still surrounds the stock, as clear from the mixed top- and bottom-line performance in first-quarter fiscal 2019 alongside soft comparable store sales (comps). In the fiscal first quarter, the bottom line lagged estimates while sales topped. Further, the bottom line was flat compared with the prior-year quarter and the top line declined marginally. While earnings lagged estimates after two straight quarters of positive surprise, sales topped after three consecutive misses.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteFactors Supporting Rite Aid’s GrowthAs mentioned earlier, the pending merger with Albertsons, the sale of assets to Walgreens and lowered debt burden have been aiding Rite Aid. Additionally, a positive outlook for fiscal 2019 has boosted investors’ confidence further.Albertsons MergerClearly, Rite Aid is on track with its merger with Albertsons, which is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2018. Progress so far is reflected by the approval of boards of directors of the companies, the expiry of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval of the proxy statements.Under the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or, only the company’s shares. For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or, 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Further, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years, after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.Asset Sales to WalgreensRite Aid has successfully completed the transfer of all stores and related assets to Walgreens under its amended and restated asset purchase agreement. As of Mar 27, 2018, it transferred all 1,932 stores and related assets to Walgreens for net cash proceeds of $4.157 billion. These cash proceeds have been used in lowering debt, thus, strengthening the company's liquidity position. As of Jun 2, 2018, the company’s debt, net of cash was $3 billion.While the transfer of stores and related assets is complete, management plans to transfer the three distribution centers and related inventory after Sep 1, 2018. Further, the company is focused on identifying opportunities to strengthen business, and providing a great experience for customers and patients.Robust Fiscal 2019 OutlookFollowing a mixed first-quarter fiscal 2019, Rite Aid reiterated its robust initial view for fiscal 2019. Moving ahead, the company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement rate environment than witnessed in fiscal 2018 and TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal along with other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. It estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019, with comps anticipated in the range of flat to up 1%. Further, the company expects adjusted net income per share of 2-6 cents compared with loss per share of 2 cents reported in fiscal 2018.Bottom LineBased on the above-mentioned factors, we believe that Rite Aid has significant growth potential in the days ahead. This is also evident from the company’s Value Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Still Interested in Retail Space? Check TheseInvestors can count on other top-ranked stocks like Shoe Carnival Inc.

647,WBA,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

648,WBA,"The much followed and widely speculated entry by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) into pharmacy business has now been put to rest with the company’s announcing that it will purchase PillPack, an online pharmacy delivery company.Eying an Attractive MarketThe purchase of PillPack for $1 billion would provide Amazon instant access to the U.S. drug business worth nearly $370 billion. Close on the heels of the news, shares of pharmacy companies CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) nosedived on concerns that the entry of the giant company Amazon might take away market share from them. Other companies UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. having Pharmacy Rx business and would be affected by Amazon’s presence and lose value.Amazon already sells medical supplies and equipment like blood pressure monitors, braces, hearing aids, and even walkers and wheelchairs in the United States. Entering the pharmacy industry therefore was like the next best step to expand in the healthcare space.Amazon’s entry into drug distribution would definitely be a game changer but the immediate implications will be more limited, given that the healthcare space is highly complex and regulated.The U.S. drug industry is opaque and divided into specific tranches such as drugmakers that make drugs, PBMs that negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, processpharmacy benefit claims, and operate home-delivery pharmacies. Down the line are wholesalers, who physically distribute drugs to pharmacies and hospitals and at the bottom are the retail pharmacies.Complex arrangements between these different players and consolidation in the space have led them to rake in profits with the end consumers facing the fall out of the rising drug prices. Amazon, with its digital capabilities and huge logistics force, is aiming distribute drugs at a low cost.In a year's time, the Retail Drug Store industry has lost 11.8% compared with the S&P 500 market’s growth of 1.9% and a decline of 1.92% for the Medical sector.One Year Price Performance  What Next?Now, Amazon must have a pharmacy benefit manager in order to have an end-to-end solution. Thus the company might opt for a PBM alliance or acquisition. Any news to this tune from the company should not be surprising. It is but sure that the company will not rest here and will make further moves in other spaces of healthcare since its CEO’s has vented his frustration over an inefficient and costly U.S. healthcare system. To this end, recently, Amazon along with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan formed a healthcare venture to provide health insurance for their employees which together is more than a  a million. Late last month, the venture got its CEO Dr. Atul Gawande, implying that it is well on track to start operations.The ThreatAmazon is known for becoming a formidable figure by garnering huge market share of any industry it lays its hands with innovative market practices and skilled leadership. So far, it has carved a niche in businesses like books, retail, supermarkets, consumer electronics and cloud computing among others.So, Amazon’s pharmacy plans surfaced last year, the existing players in the space buckled up. In a retaliatory measure, CVS went on to acquire Aetna Inc. and Express Scripts sought partnership with Cigna. Also recently Walgreens entered into agreement with Humana to set up primary care clinics which would expand its pharmacy services and expertise.While Amazon is unlikely to give traditional healthcare companies a run for their money in the short term, they definitely will have to revamp business strategies to make use of technology, data and analytics to offer better products and customer-friendly services. The whole drill should modernize the healthcare system and give investors more reasons to keep a close tab on it.Close on the heels of Amazon’s news, the FDA chief said that disruptive competition is good thing any change that makes much-needed products more accessible to consumers and lowers cost is welcome.Ana Gupte, senior health care services analyst at Leerink Partners, advised clients to keep in mind that Amazon's push into the pharmaceutical space won't happen over night and that this is going to take a long time. But the threat that Amazon's share will grow over time looms large.We believe that it will be like walking a tight rope for the incumbent players.Zacks RankAmong the companies mentioned above, Aetna Inc. (AET) Express Scripts, CVS Health and Amazon each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

649,WBA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Walgreens Boots Alliance has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Walgreens Boots Alliance’s current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint (which is 18.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 30.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Walgreens Boots Alliance has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Walgreens Boots Alliance’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Walgreens Boots Alliance has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Walgreens Boots Alliance currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes WBA a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Walgreens Boots Alliance might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives WBA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 2.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased nearly 3.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and Consensus  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and Consensus | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.  Bottom LineWalgreens Boots Alliance is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (bottom 50% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends and broader factors to turn around first.  When they do, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

The move made Innovative Product Alignment, a member of WBAD.Rationale of the MoveSpecialty medication include costly and complex drugs and are prescribed on a regular basis.

652,WBA,"The Dow endured a turbulent week, marked by lingering trade tensions. The blue-chip index also closed below its 200-day moving average for four consecutive sessions. Conflicting signals emerged from the Trump administration on trade issues. These mixed signals led to a significant spike in volatility, with the index whipsawing during several trading sessions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.5% last Friday, reversing an eight-session long losing streak. This was the blue-chip index’s longest stretch of losses since March 2017 and was just one day short of its all-time longest losing streak since 1978.Gains were primarily attributable to an energy sector rally following the meeting between OPEC and Russia led consortium that took place in Vienna on Jun 22. Finally, OPEC decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia.The index declined 2% over last week, its largest weekly decline since Mar 23 as well as its second straight weekly fall. The Dow declined modestly on last Monday, as trade war fears once again escalated making investors jittery. However, markets ended sharply lower on last Tuesday, as trade war fears escalated once again.Growing fears of a U.S.-China trade war continued to take its toll on the Dow on last Wednesday and Thursday. Markets were further rattled after a Supreme Court ruling on sales tax saw shares of online retailers tumbling.The Dow This WeekThe index shed 1.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop since May 29, closing at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union continued to weigh on investor sentiment.The index gained 0.1% on Tuesday but still ended below its 200-day moving average for the second straight session.  Investors reacted cautiously as the U.S. government continues to provide mixed signals on the ongoing trade conflicts.On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering restricting Chinese investment in high-tech U.S. companies. On Jun 25, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin first tweeted that the WSJ published “fake news”. However, he later clarified that restrictions will apply to all countries including China if they try to steal proprietary tech assets of U.S. companies.The Dow lost 0.7% on Wednesday, closing at its lowest level since May 3. The blue-chip index ended 165.52 points lower after touching an intraday high of 285.91 points. This reflects the index’s largest intraday downslide since Feb 21. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average for the third straight session.Markets opened on a positive note as President Trump stated that he has decided to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), who will assess potential threat from Chinses investment in U.S. companies. This was a softer stand compared with Trump’s earlier decision to impose China specific investment restrictions.Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated the government can block any American joint venture in China if the firm transfers critical technologies to China.Moreover, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration’s revised approach related to Chinese investment in the United States should not be considered as a soft stand on China. Following these two developments, stock markets took sharp downturn.The index gained 0.4% on Thursday, ending 98.46 points higher are dropping 100 points earlier in the day. Gains were largely broad-based with banks and tech stocks rallying strongly.

653,WBA,"Fred’s Inc  has been going off the rails as the company continues to witness sluggish comparable store sales (comps). Shares of this discount retailer, specializing in general and pharmacy products, has plunged close to 76% in a year against the industry’s gain of 18.6%.What’s Troubling the Stock?Fred’s has been carrying out store closures for a while, which has been negatively impacting comps. In fact, declining store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during first-quarter 2017. Additionally, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and continued increase in generic dispensing rate have been bruising Fred’s comps for a while. Persistent challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have also affected overall sales figures.Thanks to such downsides, comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. Also, the top- and bottom-line results declined year on year and lagged estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Incidentally, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting business. Moreover, the company’s business expansion plans were eclipsed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. If the deal were to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). However, obstacles such as antitrust concerns cancelled the deal and kept Fred’s far behind industry leaders.To the disappointment of investors, management cancelled quarterly cash dividend, alongside third-quarter results. The company expects that the cancelled dividend plan will aid share repurchases. Also, the company will be able to invest in strategic developments to induce efficiency in operations. However, with strategies falling apart and a tumbling pharmacy business, hopes of revival seem low for this drug-store retailer.  Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

654,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) stock seems to have gained solid momentum following the recent agreement to sell 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) for $4.375 billion in cash. The company has been witnessing an uptrend in its share price since completing the pilot closing and the first transfer of 97 Rite Aid stores and related assets during third-quarter fiscal 2018.The company is on track with the transferring stores and related assets to Walgreens in a phased manner, having transferred 357 stores for net proceeds of about $715 million so far. This has probably aided its stock performance. Shares of Rite Aid gained 29.1% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4%.Though the recent stock gain may entice investors, we need to know more about the company’s fundamentals before really investing in the stock. Deciding upon an investment only based on the stock movement can be futile many a times. We believe Rite Aid is one such stock, as the company has big challenges ahead and there is lot to be done before tasting real success. Clearly, the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 results suggest that it is still struggling with operations, and a full turnaround is still away.Dismal Sales Trends – A Major ConcernA look at the recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results shows that Rite Aid is grappling with the top line. Though the company’s break-even bottom-line results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter fiscal 2018, sales lagged for the second straight quarter. Notably, Rite Aid has delivered negative sales surprise in four of the trailing six quarters.Further, sales for the fiscal third-quarter dropped 5.6% year over year. This marked the company’s third straight quarter of year-over-year sales decline. Notably, sales declined 4.9% and 4.4%, respectively, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. Rite Aid’s revenues continue to be hurt by soft comps as well as decline in revenues at key business segments — Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services.Rite Aid Corporation Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Rite Aid Corporation Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRetail Pharmacy segment, which engages in selling prescription drugs, health and beauty products, and personal care items,  reported revenue declines of 4.9%, 3.4% and 3% in the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. The segment revenues were persistently hurt by soft same store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Notably, unfavorable reimbursement rates have been a challenge for the company’s top-line for nearly two years now.Meanwhile, revenues for the Pharmacy Services segment, which provides PBM (pharmacy benefit management) services and a range of pharmacy-related services, dropped 5.6%, 8.7% and 12.2%, for the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. Revenues at the Pharmacy Services segment declined due to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions and a fall in commercial business.Coming to comps, Rite Aid’s comps dropped 2.5% in third-quarter, can be attributed to fall in pharmacy and front-end sales. Notably, the company’s comps have declined for six straight quarters now, reporting declines of 3.9% and 3.4%, respectively, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. Moreover, comps dipped 2.5%, 3.4% and 3% in the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.What is Rite Aid Doing to Drive Revenues?Rite Aid’s rescue to the biggest challenge of unfavorable reimbursement rates lies in the aforementioned sale of stores and assets to Walgreens. The company’s smaller size after the sale of these assets is likely to reduce Rite Aid’s exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates. However, the real outcome will be evident only after all the stores are transferred to Walgreens.Further, the company anticipates its Pharmacy Services segment to gain traction in coming days as it plans to promote the PBM business, which it manages through Envision Rx that was acquired in 2015. Notably, the company grew Envision Rx's Medicare Part D membership by more than 100,000 lives to 500,000 lives in the past year.Going forward, the company expects Envision to drive growth across the board, as it targets increasing its customer base by 100,000 customers into fiscal 2019. Additionally, the company’s Health Dialog and RediClinic businesses are likely to aid health and wellness scores, which should improve overall performance.Health Dialog can aid in providing better health and wellness services to communities by facilitating partnership with customers to improve medication adherence and better compliance to drug therapies. Simultaneously, RediClinic is poised to provide high quality, convenient and affordable healthcare services in a retail setting, consequently improving store traffic.Wrapping UpThough the company’s plans for the PBM business as well as its Health Dialog and RediClinic wings are impressive, we believe there is a lot of work to be done. We only focused on one side of the coin here, however, there are many more problems to the Rite Aid story apart from these sales issues. To sum up, the company has a heavy debt burden, which will only be partly addressed by the proceeds from the sale of stores to Walgreens. Further, the company is lagging on the margins front and has to significantly save on drug costs to stay in competition.This makes it clear that the stock is not yet ready to reward investors with glorious returns, even though the share price has grown in leaps and bounds lately. Rightly, Rite Aid currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Does the Retail Sector Entice You? Check These StocksInvestors interested in the drugstore space should consider investing in Walgreens, which has grown 7.3% in three months and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

655,WBA,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 24.2% for 3-5 years.

Within this segment, total sales at comparable drugstores rose 4.7%, while prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew 8.9% on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.

Moreover, the guidance assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal.Our TakeWalgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.We are also upbeat about the Rite Aid acquisition deal for which the company got regulatory approval in September 2017.

(GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business.

659,WBA,"The first U.S. labor market data of 2018 has hit the tape before the opening bell this morning, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll read for December reaching 250K new jobs. This is well beyond the 195K analysts were expecting. November’s tally was revised down, but only a tad: -5K to 185K. We remain consistent with a very strong employment environment.Unsurprisingly, Services easily outpaced Goods-producing jobs — 222K to 28K, respectively. Medium-sized businesses (50-499 employees) brought in the most jobs at 100K, followed by 96K from Small companies, with Large corporations picking up the rear with 56K. Likely we’re seeing a lot of seasonal employment in these numbers from December’s holiday shopping season, but even still: strength all around.Education/Healthcare grew by 50K new jobs, followed by Trade/Transportation at 45K and Leisure/Hospitality at 28K. Even the long-dormant Construction and Manufacturing brought in relatively healthy numbers with 16K and 9K, respectively.Looking at holiday shopping totals, we see stronger-than-expected results from both Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), up 1.1% in holiday sales comps, and J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), up 3.4%. For both companies, these sorts of positive comps are rare, and with new tax cuts for the big-box retailers, both are cranking up earnings estimates for next fiscal year.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) reported top- and bottom-line beats on its Q1 2018 estimates in today’s pre-market, as well.

662,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, which marked a considerable improvement from the company’s recent trend. After posting in-line earnings last quarter, the company’s break-even results topped the Zacks estimate in the third quarter. Further, the company initiated the process of transferring stores and related assets in a phased manner to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report).During the third quarter, the company completed the pilot closing and first subsequent closing under the purchase agreement with Walgreens, which resulted in the transfer of 97 Rite Aid stores and related assets. So far, Rite Aid has successfully transferred 357 stores to Walgreens for net proceeds of about $715 million, which were used to pay down debt.Per the amended and restated asset purchase agreement with Walgreens, the latter will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of around $4.375 billion. Notably, the companies plan to continue the transfer of ownership of stores in a phased manner in coming months.As majority of the closing conditions for the sale have been met, and only few remain to be fulfilled for the transfer of stores, Rite Aid has classified the 1,932 stores and three distribution centers as assets held for sale. Consequently, operating results and cash flows from these stores are treated as discontinued operations in the company’s financial statements.Going forward, Rite Aid remains focused on completing the transfer process, while simultaneously identifying new opportunities to strengthen business and providing a great experience to customers and patients.Shares of Rite Aid have been responding positively to the transfer of stores as evident from its 19.9% growth in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 5.2% growth.Q3 in DetailRite Aid posted break-even adjusted bottom-line results for third-quarter fiscal 2018, compared with earnings per share of 3 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Further, results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss per share of 2 cents. The bottom line was primarily hurt by a decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was negated by reduction in adjusted income tax expense.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRevenues dropped 5.6% to $5,353.2 million, also falling short of the Zacks Consensus mark of $7,736.4 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues slipped 3% on account of soft same store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment declined 12.2% due to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions and a fall in commercial business.Same-store sales dipped 2.5%, owing to a 3.5% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.5% decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 198 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Further, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 2.4% due to the omission of some pharmacy networks from the prior-year quarter. Prescription sales constituted 66.5% of total drugstore sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA plunged about 32.5% year over year to $129.2 million, with the respective margin contracting 100 bps. This was due to a fall in adjusted EBITDA contributions from Retail Pharmacy segment primarily stemming from reduced reimbursement rate, as well as lower adjusted EBITDA at the Pharmacy Services segment.Store UpdateRite Aid continues to renovate stores, with 20 outlets remodeled, one opened, one expanded and one relocated in the quarter under review. This brings the company’s total wellness stores count to 2,505. Further, the company sold 97 stores to Walgreens and shut seven stores during the quarter, consequently taking the total store count to 4,404 as of Dec 2, 2017.Financial StatusRite Aid ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $169.8 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $6,905.9 million and total shareholders’ equity of $825.1 million.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s cash from operating activities came in at $129 million as of the end of third-quarter fiscal 2018 and $424.5 million for the nine months of fiscal 2018.Still Want Exposure to the Retail Space?Investors can count on Diplomat Pharmacy, Inc.

The company raised certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).Also, if the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS gets implemented without any amendment in favor of testing laboratories, the projected growth at LabCorp’s Covance, the benefit from Chiltern, the benefit from PAML and Mount Sinai and the Covance LaunchPad process will all be adversely impacted.Moreover, LabCorp faces intense competition from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. In a $55-billion U.S. lab market, hospitals control an estimated 55% of the diagnostic test market, compared to LabCorp’s 10% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including accurate testing results. As a result, LabCorp and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily on the basis of quality of service.On a positive note, LabCorp's Diagnostics business continues to remain strong on improving price, mix, acquisition and favorable foreign exchange. Also, after several quarters of dull show, Covance Drug Development reported strong growth on the back of Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. Also, over the past six months LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.1% as against the industry’s 0.5% fall.  Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks from the same space are Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

664,WBA,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has hit the headlines following the announcement of the receipt of CE Mark and commercial launch of Alinity h-series integrated system for hematology testing.Per management, the Alinity h-series solution is 20% faster per m2in comparison to the integrated hematology systems presently available. Moreover, with a throughput of 133 complete blood counts (CBCs) per m2, the Alinity h-series provides a cost and time efficient diagnostic testing experience for laboratories.Notably, the Alinity portfolio covers clinical chemistry, immunoassay, blood and plasma screening, point of care, hematology and molecular diagnostics along with Abbott's AlinIQ.Recent Developments in DiagnosticsThis Illinois-based global medical device company recently signed a $252-million managed equipment service contract with North West London Pathology (NWLP), hosted by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to gain traction in the rapidly growing diagnostics market. Per NWLP, the alliance, which presently covers 6% of the pathology market in the U.K., is expected to carry out 26 million tests per year.Continuing with the slew of developments, in June 2017, the company received CE Mark for Alinity hq, which has become the fifth new diagnostic system to be launched in Europe along with the ongoing rollout of four instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point-of-care.Interestingly, Abbott raked in 18.7% of total revenues from the diagnostics segment in the last-reported third quarter. The latest development is expected to help the company gain further traction in this space. Market ProspectsWe believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive the diagnostics market. Going by a report by MarketsAndMarkets, the global market for molecular diagnostics is projected to reach a value of $10.12 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 9.1%. Thus, in view of Abbott’s current developments in the space, we expect top-line contributions to boost from the diagnostics segment.However, the diagnostics market is dominated by well-established players like Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) and QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report).Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 8.2%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 1.7%. The company has also surpassed the 5.7% gain of the S&P 500 market.  Zacks Rank and Key PickAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked medical stock is Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

665,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%.

666,WBA,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 5. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.4%.In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 13.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has declined in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $1.87 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year decline of nearly 4.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.86 billion, which is 2.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 14.3%, while the industry grew 3%.Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been on a roll owing to strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now anticipated to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Constellation Brands has an Earnings ESP of -0.07%.

667,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 3. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported loss per share of 1 cent, which was in line with estimates. Further, the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, against earnings of 2 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.74 billion, down 4.4% from the prior-year quarter.Following the recent sale of 250 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), Rite Aid’s shares have shown some momentum. The company’s shares dipped 2.4% in the last three months, narrower than the industry’s decline of 7.1%.Factors at PlayAfter the aforementioned sale of stores to Walgreens, Rite Aid is poised to improve financial leverage and balance sheet using the funds from the transaction. To strengthen operations, Rite Aid remains focused on remodeling wellness stores. These newly renovated wellness stores tempt customers to spend more time on selecting their personal care products, consequently enabling the company to generate increased sales.In another move to enhance customer experience, Rite Aid started accepting payments via digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, as well as other tap and pay credit and debit cards. Recently, the company resorted to accepting Apple Pay online, as customers are using smartphones to make transactions. In fact, management stated that over half of its website visitors access www.riteaid.com from their mobiles, the most being iPhone users. This development is likely to provide customers with a more convenient and better shopping experience that in turn will attract more traffic.Additionally, the company has been undertaking a number of strategies to drive growth such as the expansion of its pharmacy and clinical services, along with the reduction of costs.  Rite Aid has utilized additional resources, such as the introduction of HealthSpot telehealth booths at its Ohio pharmacies, addition of RediClinics to its stores, its Wellness+ with Plenti program, as well as the Flu Immunization program to stimulate customer demand amid the soft macroeconomic scenario. The company also acquired EnvisionRx, which will enable it to offer cost-friendly health plans and solutions for employers, drive growth and bolster shareholder value.On the cost front, the company is focusing on generating cost savings through centralized indirect procurement of drugs and reduction in supply chain costs. We believe that these programs and initiatives will enable the company to increase customer base and facilitate the generation of long-term profitability as well.However, the company remains prone to competition from rivals. Rite Aid’s generic drug sales have been adversely affected by Wal-Mart’s strategy of entering the retail generic drug market. Due to Wal-Mart’s wide array of manufacturers in India, Israel, and the United States, the mass merchant offers generic drugs at a discounted price compared with its rival companies. Further, speculations about Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entry in the drugstore business remain a threat.Nonetheless, let’s see if Rite Aid’s growth drivers can help counter the challenges this time around.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

668,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Jan 4.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.38%. It is noteworthy that Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.46%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?  Our proven model shows that Walgreens Boots is likely to beat on earnings in the fiscal first quarter riding on the right combination of the following two key ingredients: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.97%. This indicates a likely positive earnings surprise for the stock.Zacks Rank: Walgreens carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 and 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Further coupled with a positive ESP, the combination makes us confident of an expected positive surprise.We caution against the sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) going into an earnings announcement.  Key CatalystsNotably, Walgreens Boots’ entire business has been posed with tough challenges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the devastating hurricane activity witnessed in the latter half of 2017. The company anticipates this lean patch to continue even in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as the catastrophic event might adversely impact its overall business in Puerto Rico, where Walgreens Boost leads as the largest pharmacy chain. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Per Walgreens, the damages occurred to Puerto Rico's infrastructure, which grossly impacted trading on its stores so far, is expected to affected the adjusted earnings per share by a few cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. On the whole, the company expects adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $5.40-$5.70 in fiscal 2018.Walgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as a volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal first quarter as well.However, the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint due to various factors including a decline across multiple product categories with beauty being hampered by the timing of product launches. Also, total retail sales were down on the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations.Amid this drag in retail pharmacy business, we are looking forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid stores, which might boost its business. While the transition process of these stores is underway, we believe this integration to help Walgreens Boots expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets including the Northeast. However, we expect no material benefit to realize from this development till the first quarter closes.Meanwhile, strong market growth is expected in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price rise. Also, in order to expand footprint in Asia, the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea earlier in 2017. This development is likely to contribute to the top line in the fiscal first quarter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they too have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:Zynex, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (MMSI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank of 1.ICON Public Limited Company (ICLR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

669,WBA,"The year 2017 has failed to turn things around for CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has underperformed the S&P 500 market year to date. The stock has lost 5.4% as against the S&P 500 market’s 20.4% gain.During the first-quarter 2017 earnings call, CVS Health’s President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said, “We continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year, but our goals remain clear, and we fully intend to return to healthy levels of growth.” Unfortunately, little of this could materialize. The company is still grappling with issues from the past along with other challenges.2016 Deals Major BlowsCVS Health is still trying to recover from the setback caused by Prime Therapeutics’ collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) in August 2016. Owing to this, CVS Health lost access to Prime’s 22 million members. Notably, Prime Therapeutics is the fourth largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the United States owned by 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.Another major blow was dealt at the end of 2016 when the TRICARE retail pharmacy network managed by Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) restricted CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, from participating. This network, with more than 57,000 locations, included Walgreens Boots as a member instead.Thanks to these developments, CVS Health’s shares lost 15.2% in the last five months of 2016.   2017 Hasn’t Been Kind as WellCVS Health’s Retail/Long Term Care (LTC) business has been sluggish since first-quarter 2017 largely due to declining same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and a rise in the generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed).The company’s Retail/LTC business was also majorly impacted by weak operations in hurricane-ravaged areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. The company has valued the hurricane impact at about $55 million — primarily costs to cover insurance deductibles.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market has aggravated matters for CVS Health. To counter competition, CVS Health will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.CVS Health ~ A Force to Reckon With“If there is no struggle, there is no progress”Nothing could be more apt than this remark by Frederick Douglass. CVS Health, with a massive market cap of $74.52 billion, has been leaving no stones unturned to bounce back.Mergers & Acquisitions to Strengthen PBM BusinessIn a historic decision, CVS Health decided to acquire the United States’ third-largest health insurance company Aetna (AET) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies from the deal, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction.Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business.Apart from the Aetna deal, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS Health’s PBM customers.Initiatives to Boost Retail/LTC BusinessThe company has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. Subsequently, the company is planning to collaborate with PBMs and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Recognizing the growing opportunities in the digital market, CVS Health has also been focused on enhancing its online and mobile capabilities in 2017. Building on the strength of its digital tools within pharmacy, with 60% of patients using them, the company is focused on offering advanced services to customers. These services range from Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality and ExtraCare. Moreover, CVS Health has been enthusiastically working with Instacart and is now delivering from 2,800 stores.Is There a Rebound in the Cards?CVS Health has been firing on all cylinders of late. The company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) to provide services including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.While such measures will help smoothen the bumpy ride for the company, 2018 might come with a fresh set of surprises and challenges.

670,WBA,"Fred’s Inc  has been reeling under sluggish comparable store sales (comps) in an intensely competitive retail scenario. The company’s murky performance is reflected in its price trend. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has plunged as much as 80.4% over the past year against the industry’s rally of 10.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve into some of the aspects that have led to the dismal performance of this discount retailer of pharmaceutical and general merchandise.What’s Weighing on Investors’ Sentiments?Rapid technological developments and lifestyle changes have radically altered consumers’ shopping habits. Companies which adapt with such market trends have been successfully afloat, while others suffer receding store traffic and resort to closures.Incidentally, Fred’s has been carrying out store closures for a while, which has been negatively impacting the company’s comps rate. In fact, declining store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during first-quarter 2017. Additionally, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and continued rise in generic dispensing rate have led to reduced comps. Moreover, persisting challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have affected overall sales figures.  Further, Fred’s store expansion plans and aspirations to emerge as one of the largest pharmacy chain in the retail drugstore space were crushed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. Also, the revised deal between Walgreens and Rite Aid offered no gains, thus keeping Fred’s behind industry leaders CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens and Rite Aid.Thanks to the downsides, we note that comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. Also, both top- and bottom-line results declined year on year and lagged estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Incidentally, Fred’s has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting Fred’s business.To make matters worse, management cancelled quarterly cash dividend, alongside third-quarter results. Management stated that the cancelled dividend plan will help the company indulge in share repurchases and invest in strategic developments to induce efficiency in operations. However, with strategies failing to yield results and tumbling business, hopes of revival seem low for this drug-store retailer.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

672,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) continues to dominate the headlines riding on its inorganic expansion spree. Following last week’s news on the company’s plan to invest in Chinese pharmacy chain Guoda, Walgreens Boots is once again grabbing attention with the piece of information revolving around its partnership with KKR & Co. L.P., which has completed the acquisition of pharmacy services provider, PharMerica Corp.In August, Walgreens Boots along with privately held global investment firm KKR had announced this definitive merger agreement to acquire Pharmerica for an all-cash transaction valued at $1.4 billion. With the recent closing of this buyout, the newly formed company will be predominantly controlled by KKR and Walgreens Boots will only have a minor stake in it.Walgreen Boots expects this investment to help it support quality and affordable patient care in a better fashion. While PharMerica will be entitled to additional resources and expertise to advance and grow its institutional pharmacy services business on the back of its aquirers KKR and Walgreens Boots’ strengths.Notably, Walgreens Boots has set a major milestone in global expansion this month with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. Good news is that his investment should provide a strong incentive to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business on successful completion.The company is also currently focusing on strategic collaborations in order to meet challenges in the U.S. Pharmacy market. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company announced a partnership agreement with Fareva by dint of which, the latter will buy the former’s contract manufacturing business (“BCM”). Notably, BCM operates factories in the U.K., France and Germany. Management earlier noted that the partnership had initiated by the end of October. All these crucial developments should aid the company to maximize its scope and scale in retail pharmacy market.Share Price  Over the past month, Walgreens Boots has been trading below the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.6%, as compared to the industry’s 2.9% increase during the period.Zacks Rank and Key Picks Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

673,WBA,"A lot has been going on with drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), which has lost a whopping 80% this year, much wider than the industry’s decline of 12.5%. In fact, the stock has plunged nearly 21% over the past week, on speculations of Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entry in the drugstore business.After Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market — a move that has kept grocery retailers on their toes — it looks like the online giant is now eyeing the drugstore industry. Though the news hasn’t been confirmed by Amazon, various media reports suggest that the e-commerce king is undertaking several steps to enter the prescription drug distribution space. Per the reports, Amazon is in talks with pharmacy benefit managers and various talented personnel to analyze the drugstore trends to foray into the market.However, Amazon’s expansion strategy is just one of the reasons behind Rite Aid’s debacle. Let’s take a look at the other reasons for which this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost ground.Merger Fallout With WalgreensRite Aid suffered a huge setback in June, when its merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) was terminated for failing to get the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) nod after two years of investigation. Thereafter, Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory, for $5.175 billion as well as termination charges of $325 million. However, this contract was also amended recently, to Walgreens agreeing to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal. The former will now pay $4.375 billion for the deal. While this proposal finally won the FTC’s clearance last month, the string of all these events weighed upon investors’ sentiment.Unfavorable Reimbursement Rates Dent MarginsRite Aid has been battling unfavorable reimbursement rates for a while now. Evidently, lower pharmacy reimbursement rates dented the company’s Retail Pharmacy gross profit, which in turn hurt Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA in the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. Well, Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 100 and 110 bps in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. Nevertheless, termination charges of $325 million received from Walgreens partly cushioned Rite Aid’s operating results in the second quarter. However, management expects reimbursement rates to continue to pressurize pharmacy margins in the second half of the fiscal.Unimpressive Surprise History, Dismal Q2 PerformanceRite Aid’s earnings surprise history is not very impressive. The company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters, including two quarters of negative earnings surprise. Though the company’s bottom-line matched the Zacks consensus mark in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reported a loss of 1 cent as against the year-ago period earnings of 3 cents per share. Additionally, the top line remained soft, with same store sales declining on account of lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Apart from these factors, Rite Aid’s second-quarter debacle could be attributable to the impact of the merger ditch as well as the reduced reimbursement rates, as discussed above.Any Positive Signals Ahead?While the final pact with Walgreens will reduce Rite Aid’s core business, it is likely to lower Rite Aid’s debt position and improve its financial leverage and balance sheet. Management stated that it intends to use the funds from this deal to repay roughly $270 million worth of net liabilities associated with the divested assets; nearly $100 million of restructuring expenses and transaction fees and $85 million as income tax. Moreover, Rite Aid will continue to operate its pharmacy benefit manager — EnvisionRX, RediClinic and Health Dialog.Thus, the latest contract should make Rite Aid a smaller, but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates. However, management chose not to provide any guidance until it gets any clarity on the timing of its planned store divestitures. So for now, we prefer to remain on the sidelines.Still Want Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors can count on Diplomat Pharmacy, Inc.

674,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), which had quite an eventful journey of late, reported dismal second-quarter fiscal 2018 results last week. Shares of the company have plunged 14% since the company posted a loss, and its top line declined year over year alongside lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The second-quarter outcome came roughly a week after Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) received the Federal Trade Commission’s (‘’FTC’’) nod for their latest pact. The companies have been in talks since October 2015 to engage in a transaction — first a merger, which was terminated on antitrust concerns (this June) and replaced by Walgreens’ bid to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. Well, the second proposal, which was revised recently — to acquire 250 lesser stores, finally appeased the FTC on Sep 19.All aforementioned actions have taken a toll on investors’ sentiment, as evident from Rite Aid’s year-to-date slump of 76.2%, which is significantly wider than the industry’s 3.7% drop. Let’s delve deeper into Rite Aid’s second-quarter results and see where the company is headed.Q2 in DetailRite Aid posted adjusted loss of 1 cent per share for the second quarter that came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, this compared unfavorably with the year-ago period earnings of 3 cents. Management blamed the miserable performance on a tough reimbursement rate environment, along with the impacts from the amended asset sale deal.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhile Rite Aid benefited from a merger termination fee of $325 million that it received from Walgreens, decline in adjusted EBITDA weighed upon its performance.  Furthermore, revenues dropped 4.4% to $7,678.9 million, also falling short of the Zacks Consensus mark of $7,871 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues slipped 3.4% on account of soft same store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment dropped tumbled 8.7% owing to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions.Same-store sales declined 3.4%, owing to a 4.6% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.9% dip in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 189 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Also, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.8%. Prescription sales constituted 67.8% of total drugstore sales and third-party prescription sales accounted for 98.3% of pharmacy sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA crashed about 31.8% year over year to $213.3 million, with the respective margin contracting 110 bps. This was due to a fall in adjusted EBITDA contributions from Retail Pharmacy segment mainly owing to reduced reimbursement rate. This was somewhat compensated by efficient cost curtailment and improved scrip counts and generic purchasing efficiencies.Store UpdatesRite Aid continues to renovate stores, with 54 outlets remodeled, 1 opened and 1 relocated in the quarter under review. This brings the company’s total wellness stores count to 2,532. Further, the company shut 17 stores during the quarter, thus taking the total store count to 4,507 as of Sep 2, 2017.Financial StatusRite Aid ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $239 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $7,082.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $733.6 million. The company also had borrowings worth $2.2 billion remaining under its $3.7 billion revolving credit facility, alongside having outstanding letters of credit worth $59 million.Further, Rite Aid’s cash from operating activities came in at $297.8 for the first half of fiscal 2018.Where’s Rite Aid Headed?Per the latest deal with Walgreens, the latter will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of around $4.375 billion. Notably, the companies plan to carry out the transition of ownership of stores in a phased manner, beginning in October 2017. The transition is likely to be completed by spring 2018.While the amended contract wasn’t well received by investors as it will curtail Rite Aid’s main business, the transaction is likely to lower Rite Aid’s debt position and improve its financial leverage and balance sheet. Management stated that it intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt. In this regard, the company plans to repay roughly $270 million worth of net liabilities associated with the divested assets; restructuring expenses and transaction fees of nearly $100 million and $85 million as income tax.All said, the deal will make the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company a smaller, but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates, which has been a hindrance for the company for quite some time now. As for Walgreens, with the approval of this long-awaited deal, the company is now poised to dominate the drugstore chain in the United States in terms of size, leaving behind CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Rite Aid, on the other hand, will occupy the third spot.Still Want Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors can count on Herbalife LTD.

675,WBA,"The retail segment has been witnessing increased competition owing to technological upgradations and continuous expansion efforts by large retailers. Consumers are increasingly shifting toward online shopping, thereby hurting store traffic. As a result, smaller firms in the segment, who are incapable of adapting with such changing trends, have resorted to store closures as consumer footfall continues to decline.Fred's, Inc  is one such company that has resorted to store closures amid such challenging retail scenario. Let’s now delve into some of the aspects that have led to the dismal performance of the company.Declining Comps and Store Closure Fred's has been witnessing sluggish comps, lately, owing to declining store traffic and sale of discontinued inventory. A glance at the comps’ performance over the past four months reveals that, while comps were up 0.8% for during May, the same declined 1.6%, 0.1% and 0.5% during June, July and August, respectively. In fact, the decline in store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during the first quarter of 2017. Persisting challenges in the Front Store business and competitive consumable categories had also affected the company’s overall sales figures.Cancelled Walgreens-Rite Aid Merger Fred's strategic plans for store expansion were gravely impacted by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger on June 30. If the deal was to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees iincurred in connection with this deal, have become unyielding and hurt the company’s profit reserves.Lack of International Exposure Since the developed markets of Europe, America and Canada are already saturated, most retail companies are looking toward expanding themselves in developing nations such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia, amongst others. These nations offer great growth opportunity owing to rising population and an affluent middle class. Fred’s, however, is yet to strengthen footprint in these markets.Final Thoughts Such ongoing challenges have led Fred’s to deliver weak bottom-line performance over the past five quarters, posting a loss in each of them.Nevertheless, the company has been making significant advancement with its turnaround strategies that aims at reducing selling, general and administrative expenses and driving free cash flow. The turnaround plans also includes focusing on organization of its pharmacy business, to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. The company has also been emphasizing on internal reorganization and geographic expansion. However, such efforts are yet to bear significant impacts upon the company’s top-line performance.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

676,WBA,"The Finish Line, Inc.  is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of athletic footwear, activewear and accessories will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Finish Line delivered a 9.1% beat in the previous quarter. However, the company’s bottom-line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, by an average of 13.2%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 37 cents, which is wider than a loss of 24 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $360.9 million, down 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.The Finish Line, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Finish Line, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Finish Line, Inc. QuoteNotably, Finish Line has outperformed the broader industry in the past month, reflecting a positive investor sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have gained 28%, compared with the industry’s growth of 18.8%.Factors at PlayWhile Finish Line’s earnings topped the Zacks estimate in second-quarter fiscal 2018, it declined more than five folds compared with the prior-year figure. The company is not immune to the intense promotions in the athletic space along with the shift of most retailers to digital and differentiated retailing. This shift has thwarted Finish Line’s strategy of cutting on prices to sustain competition from big names in the industry. Further, the increased promotions have been considerably weighing upon the company’s margins for quite a while now.Further, the company’s outlook for the second half and fiscal 2018 displays a dismal picture. The company anticipates comparable sales to decline 3-5% in the third and fourth quarter, as well as fiscal 2018. Moreover, it expects adjusted loss of 32-40 cents per share in the third quarter and earnings of 50-58 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Consequently, it also lowered earnings view for fiscal 2018 to range between 50-60 cents per share, way below the previous forecast of $1.12-$1.23 per share.While Finish Line remains committed toward effective inventory and expense management, and developing omni-channel capacities, the aforementioned hurdles make us apprehensive about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Finish Line is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

677,WBA,"After a long-drawn tug-of-war with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), finally it was Walgreens Boots Alliance’s (WBA  -  Free Report) turn to secure the purchase of a number of Rite Aid (RAD) stores last week. The company had ended up purchasing 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.However, the entire process has so far failed to make the investors happy.Stages of CommotionNotably, since 2015-end, Walgreens was caught in resolving the regulatory hurdle to acquire the entire U.S. retail pharmacy chain of Rite Aid. This effort eventually fell flat a couple of months back with FTC not approving of the mega merger.While the pharmacy-led, health and well-being enterprise giant came up with an amended agreement, the investors were in shock about Walgreens’ shelving of the $17 billion acquisition deal, which had once promised a strong platform to develop the company’s’ brand presence as well as overall future business growth.Investors eventually gained confidence delving into the original amendment’s details that mentioned about the buy of 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion. It was understood that the new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. Notably, Rite Aid ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.Close on the heels of this development, the final amended terms of the deal, which demanded acquisition of another 250 lesser number of stores from Rite Aid, came as a big blow to the investors.Walgreens Still a Gainer?Fortunately, the answer is yes. The final agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens with certain transition services for up to three years post the deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be entirely realized within four years of its initial completion.  This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets including the Northeast.Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and the Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C.This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge over names like Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

678,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 28. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported a negative surprise as a loss per share of 2 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. Further, the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, compared with earnings of 3 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release.Factors at PlayThe company’s negative surprise trend in recent quarters and the termination of the merger deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) has led the stock to underperform the industry in the last three months. Shares of Rite Aid have declined 22.2%, against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.The company suffered a loss in first-quarter 2018 driven by soft sales due to negative comparable store sales (comps) that stemmed from lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Further, Rite Aid continues to battle lower pharmacy reimbursement rates that hurt margins in first-quarter fiscal 2018.However, the recent Federal Trade Commission’s (""FTC"") approval for the sale of 1,932 Rite Aid stores to Walgreens for $4.375 billion bodes well. This will help in lowering Rite Aid’s debt and improving financial flexibility, making it a smaller, yet stronger independent firm with solid control in key markets. Further, the company's stringent focus on cost management and strengthening its portfolio of health and wellness services also remain impressive. Nonetheless, let’s see if Rite Aid’s growth drivers can help counter the challenges this time around.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of -33.33%, with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

679,WBA,"After four amendments, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) finally received a nod for the fresh proposal the latter put forward yesterday. The companies have been in talks since October 2015 to engage in a transaction – first a merger, which was terminated on antitrust concerns and replaced by Walgreens bid to buy Rite Aid stores. The second proposal, which was revised yesterday to acquire 250 lesser stores, eventually appeased the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).Shares of Rite Aid fell 12.1% to $2.40 following the news, while Walgreens was down 1.7% closing at $81.21.Despite yesterday’s fall, Rite Aid has grown 6.7% in the past month, outperforming the industry's increase of 5%. Meanwhile, Walgreens has improved only 0.8%, lagging the industry’s gain.The New BidWalgreens revised its proposal to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion, mainly to remove antitrust concerns. As part of the fresh bid, Walgreens will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal. The company will now pay $4.375 billion for the deal.However, the new proposal retained the clause which allows Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate, at cost equivalent to Walgreens for about 10 years. Meanwhile, Rite Aid will provide certain transition services to Walgreens for up to three years post the deal closure. The deal has successfully completed the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period.The stores to be sold under the amended deal are primarily situated in the Northeast and Southern parts of the United States. The three distribution centers, which are also part of the agreement, include those which are housed in Dayville, CT, Philadelphia and Spartanburg, SC.Now, the companies plan to carry out the transition of ownership of stores in a phased manner, beginning in October 2017. The transition is likely to be completed by spring 2018.Benefits to Rite AidThe transaction is likely to benefit Rite Aid in lowering debt position and improving financial leverage and balance sheet. The company intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt. The deal will also make Rite Aid a smaller, but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates, which has been a hindrance for the company for quite some time now.Following the completion of the transaction, Rite Aid will operate about 2,600 stores and six distribution centers, alongside EnvisionRx — its pharmacy benefit manager; RediClinic and Health Dialog.The BackgroundWalgreens-Rite Aid had initially agreed to a merger agreement in October 2015, which fell apart after two years of investigation by the FTC in June 2017. Replacing the older agreement, Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory, for $5.175 billion as well as termination charges of $325 million.ConclusionWith the approval of this long awaited deal, Walgreens is now ready to become the No. 1 drugstore chain in the United States by size, leaving behind CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report). Further, Rite Aid will occupy the third spot. While Walgreens will gain from a significant expansion of its footprint, Rite Aid will be well poised to improve its financial leverage by paying down huge debts.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Wanting Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors interested in the Drugstore space can invest in Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report). The stock has gained whopping 39.6% year to date and has a VGM Score of A. Moreover, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

681,WBA,"Shares of Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) fell more than 10% on Tuesday after Walgreens Boots (WBA  -  Free Report) received government approval to buy fewer Rite Aid stores than had initially been proposed.In order to clear a regulatory hurdle presented by the Federal Trade Commission, Walgreens Boots said it would only buy 1,932 stores from Rite Aid. The deal is still worth a whopping $4.38 billion, but that total is a full 254 fewer stores than the companies agreed to in June.Walgreens Boots also said that it intends to acquire three Rite Aid distribution centers located in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. The exchange and transition of these distribution centers will not begin for at least another year, however.Today’s approval looks to be the final chapter in what has been a lengthy saga involving Walgreens and Rite Aid. Earlier this year, Walgreens said it was calling off its nearly two-year operation to acquire its rival pharmacy company after numerous antitrust cases halted the deal.Instead, Walgreens would settle for acquiring just under half of Rite Aid’s domestic stores—a figure that has obviously since been reduced. Still, the store purchase plan should help widen Walgreens Boots’ foothold in the U.S., where it also competes with the likes of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report).“With this process taking close to two years to come to a conclusion, we think the final outcome and the structure of the transaction were well anticipated,” an analyst at Pivotal Research Group told CNBC. “However, with each recent iteration of the transaction, the economics appear to be shifting more and more in Walgreens' favor.”The store purchases will begin in October and will be completed in spring 2018, Walgreens said. The company also noted that the acquisitions will not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018, although it expects annual synergies to reach $300 million eventually.“We are confident in the path ahead and look forward to working together to shape the future of health care and deliver on the full potential these stores bring to our network,” Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in a press release.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

682,WBA,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

683,WBA,"We expect NIKE Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.8%.Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for over three years now, delivering positive earnings surprises for 21 straight quarters. For the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 22.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 39 cents, reflecting year-over year decline of 22.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has been stable in the past 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8.4 billion, reflecting a jump of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Nike, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nike, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nike, Inc. QuoteNIKE has outperformed the Consumer Discretionary sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 15.7%, compared with the sector’s jump of 4.1%.Factors at PlayNIKE’s robust growth and innovation efforts have been reflected in its robust earnings surprise trend. Additionally, persistent growth at international locations and global NIKE Direct business along with solid demand for the NIKE brand has been providing a boost to the top line. Going forward, the company remains confident of growth drivers like efficient supply chain, enhanced sync between the digital and physical experiences, constant innovations and strategic investments, all of which are likely to bolster long-term shareholder value.While NIKE sees itself well positioned to gain from the rise in digital era, it remains focused on strengthening its leadership position and driving growth through the next phase. To do this, the company remains aggressively focused on its “triple-double” strategy.Additionally, NIKE has been focused on Consumer Direct Offense plan. Driven by its Triple Double strategy, this restructuring plan focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development, along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions. This has also aided the company’s positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.However, lackluster sales trend in the company’s key North American market remains a headwind. Soft sales in North America are attributed to the lackluster product assortments, increased promotions due to growth of e-commerce and intensified competition. Moreover, the company’s wholesale business in the region has been impacted due to increased focus on online sales. Moreover, we believe the overall environment is likely to remain promotional in North America, hurting the results in this segment.Furthermore, the company anticipates near-term results to be impacted by the tough retail environment, which led to a bleak second-quarter view. For fiscal 2018, reported revenues for the fiscal are still anticipated to increase in the mid-single digits. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects reported revenue in the low-single digit range. The company expects decline in North America and in the Converse segment to be partly mitigated by strength in international business.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.49% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 41 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. This along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Costco Wholesale Corp.

684,WBA,"The Dow and the S&P 500 hit fresh records on Monday as North Korea fears ebb following U.S. Secretary of Treasury Rex Tillerson’s announcement that the United States was looking for a peaceful solution for its problems with the Asian country. Further, investors focused on the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting. This gave rise to speculations that the Fed might start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet which boosted the U.S. Treasury yields, leading to broad based gains for the financial sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,331.35, gaining 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2% to close at 2,503.87. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.64, increasing 0.1%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,611 to 1,202.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,857 to 999.  the CBOE VIX touched 9.88 — the lowest level since Aug 5..Dow, S&P 500 Hit Fresh RecordsThe Dow added 63.01 points of Monday to end the session on a record high, registering its fifth record close on the trot and seven straight sessions of gains.

Further, the Nasdaq also hit an intraday record after adding 6.17 points.North Korea Fears Ebb, Markets Gain TractionLingering geopolitical tensions with North Korea did not deter the investor sentiment anymore. Economists had earlier commented that investors have become immune to activities by North Korea and such fears have now ebbed. In an interview late Sunday U.S. Secretary of Treasury, Rex Tillerson announced that the United States was looking for a ‘peaceful solution’ for the problems with North Korea. He also commented that the United States would try to get North Korea in a ‘constructive, productive, dialogue.’ Such developments lifted the investor sentiment. However, the Republican leader also said that if such diplomatic resolutions fail, the United States would have to switch to military action as the last resort. Tillerson said that U.S. wants China to mount pressure on Pyongyang by curbing oil supply to North Korea and also wants Russia to reduce the number of foreign laborers it hires from North Korea.In a separate interview to ABC News, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster commented that North Korea must denuclearize as President Trump has clearly stated that such threats from Pyongyang to citizens of the United States would not be tolerated. Moreover, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley also warned North Korea of dire consequences if Kim Jong-un “keeps on with this reckless behavior.”Investors Eye the Federal Open Market Committee MeetingMarket watchers are focused on the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting, scheduled to begin on Tuesday. Investors do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates due to inflation figures lingering below the targeted 2%. However, analysts do speculate the chances of Fed announcing plans to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Such speculations boosted U.S. Treasury yields.  The benchmark 10-year yield and short-term two-year yield traded at 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. This boded well for banks and boosted the overall financial sector.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnion Pacific Streamlines Operations to Improve EfficiencyUnion Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is constantly looking to increase efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner.

685,WBA,"The Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") seems to be getting harsher on drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report), which have been trying to appease the regulatory body since its initial merger pact in 2015. Per the latest developments and a word from sources, Walgreens is again planning to revise its deal to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, in order to get regulatory approval.The FTC is now close to giving decision on the Walgreens-Rite Aid’s latest deal, where Walgreens will acquire the aforementioned Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion. However, Walgreens, which has been closely working with FTC, is currently considering revising deal to resolve some regulatory concerns. Though the exact tweaking for the number of stores that will be bought was not made known, sources expect a revised deal to be brought to light as early as next week. This would give FTC another 30 days to review the new deal and give its decision.Walgreens closed at $82.60, up a marginal 0.1% yesterday, while Rite Aid rose 3.8% to $2.73.Moreover, Rite Aid has rallied 21.4% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 4.8% growth. Meanwhile, Walgreens has improved only 2.5%, also lagging the industry’s gain.The BackgroundWalgreens-Rite Aid had initially agreed to a merger agreement in October 2015, which fell apart after two years of investigation by the FTC in June 2017. Replacing the older agreement, Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory, for $5.175 billion as well as termination charges of $325 million.The aforementioned stores to be sold are primarily situated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern parts of the United States. The three distribution centers, which are also part of the agreement, include those which are housed in Dayville, CT, Philadelphia and Spartanburg, SC. Further, the new transaction allows Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate, at cost price for about 10 years. Meanwhile, Rite Aid will provide certain transition services to Walgreens for up to three years post the deal closure. The initial deal was approved by the directors of both companies.ConclusionThe new deal to be put forward by Walgreens would mark the fourth revised proposal in the whole episode of establishing a successful transaction with Rite Aid.If the deal materializes, Walgreens will become the No. 1 drugstore chain in the United States by size, leaving behind CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report). Further, the sale of nearly half of its more than 4,500 stores would leave Rite Aid on the third spot. While Walgreens will gain from a significant expansion of its footprint, Rite Aid will be well poised to improve its financial leverage by paying down huge debts.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Wanting Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors interested in the Drugstore space can invest in Herbalife LTD.

686,WBA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Walgreens Boots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Walgreens Boots’ current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 18.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Walgreens Boots has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Walgreens Boots’ stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Walgreens Boots has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Walgreens Boots currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes WBA a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Walgreens Boots might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives WBA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and five lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.2%.

QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWalgreens Boots is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 26% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

687,WBA,"It seems that the leaders of New York City have been striving hard to make the city smoke-free. In fact, the Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has reportedly issued a series of laws in April to reduce the number of smokers in the city over the next three years.Per the Aug 28 bill, the minimum price for a pack of cigarettes will now be $13 in New York. Notably, a packet of cigarettes currently costs $10.50. The latest price hike has made New York the most expensive city in the U.S. for cigarettes, as declared by some officials in the Health Department stated in sources. In the past too, the mayor has resorted to price hike as a tool to restrict smokers. Smoking rate in the city has declined from 21.5% in 2002 to about 14.3% in 2015. The rate is expected to decline to 12% by 2020 due to this price hike, as anticipated by some city health officials.The law was introduced in anticipation of making almost 900,000 smokers quit smoking as well as to reduce the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco products in the city. Currently, about 8,300 retailers have a license to sell cigarettes.The mayor is also seeking to ban the sale of all tobacco products in pharmacies, as a result of which pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Duane Reade and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) will have to take cigarettes off their shelves. The new legislation also requires licensing of e-cigarette retailers and will force all residential buildings to have smoking policies, including banning cigarettes in common areas like hallways.We note that these measures will severely dent businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that declined 5.6% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 5.5% and British American declined 4.3%, Vector Group and Altria declined 7.8% and 15.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues.Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. Altria is expanding presence in the e-cigarette market steadily with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands.On the other hand, Philip Morris has been gaining from its iQOS smokeless cigarettes since its launch in November 2014. The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies amid declining tobacco volumes.However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Bottom LineWhile price hike and lower availability of cigarettes do help smokers to quit smoking, as seen in the past, the ban also creates a serious black market for these products, which can be detrimental to all tobacco companies.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

688,WBA,"Wednesday, October 25, 2017Before we tick down the list of new Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell this morning, another metric pointing to a strengthening economy: a positive read on September (preliminary) Durable Goods Orders. Results came out way ahead of expectations at +2.2%; analysts had been looking for +0.8%. Removing the more-volatile transportation goods totals, we still see +0.7%, which is again a healthy number. Ex-capital goods, non-Defense, ex-aircraft came in at +1.3%.These numbers indicate that factories look to be busier manufacturing hard products, which spells sunny days ahead for industrial and commercial companies, their workforces and their shareholders. Whatever doubt remains about a new Fed hike coming round the bend is even further quashed. The domestic economy is finally living up to its potential, after years of sluggish growth.Q3 Earnings BonanzaThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), speaking of durable goods, topped expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $2.72 per share beat the $2.65 Zacks consensus estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. Revenues reached $24.31 billion versus the $24.06 billion expected. The premier aircraft manufacturer also upped full-year guidance by a dime to $9.90 - 10.10 per share. Lower backlog quarter over quarter — an important metric for a company that makes such huge and expensive items — helped its Q3 results. Shares are up modestly at this hour; bear in mind BA stock has skyrocketed 70% since 2017 began.Fiscal Q4 2017 results from Visa (V  -  Free Report) also beat earnings and sales estimates, with 90 cents per share up 5 cents over the Zacks consensus and +15.4% from a year ago. Net operational revenues rose 14% year over year to $4.9 billion, higher than the $4.62 billion we were looking for. Visa continues its pristine earnings performance, having averaged an 8.4% positive surprise in its trailing four quarters. Visa shares are up another 1% in the early session, and are up nearly 40% year to date.Defense major Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) posted a huge earnings beat: $3.68 per share was far ahead of the expected $2.92, whereas quarterly sales of $6.53 billion came in higher than the $6.32 billion anticipated. Northrop also cranked up its full-year earnings guidance notably — from $12.10 - 12.40 per share previously to $12.90 - 13.10 this morning. NOC shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in the current pre-market.Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) also beat on top and bottom lines, albeit less impressively by comparison. Earnings of 50 cents per share topped estimates by a penny, whereas revenues for the quarter $9.1 billion from the expected $8.84 billion. Organic growth of 4% and improved results from its Sprite brand were the notable takeaways. Coke has now beaten earnings estimates 4 times in the last 5 quarters.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) — the parent company of pharma retailer Walgreen’s — posted an impressive earnings beat of $1.31 per share, compared to the $1.22 expected, up 22.4% year over year. Sales of $30.15 billion outpaced the $30.05 in the Zacks estimate, up 5.3% year over year. Strong retail pharma sales in the U.S. was somewhat offset by weaker International sales. But WBA shares are up markedly in today’s early session, nearly +4%.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

690,WBA,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has an average earnings beat of 1.1% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp’s top-line performance continues to be affected by softness in its Covance Drug Development business, as was the case in the last reported quarter as well. The weak performance was led by sluggish early development and central lab businesses, which were affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016. Also, adverse foreign exchange rates affected the numbers to the tune of 140 basis points (bps) at this segment.Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s expectations of an improvement in the Covance Drug Development arm starting the second half of 2017. This should get reflected in the third-quarter performance.Over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have dented its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteNotably, the company are not positive about the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this will most likely have no impact on its third-quarter results.Unfavorable foreign exchange continues to be a pressing concern for the company. Previously, LabCorp had anticipated an approximate 40-bps negative currency impact on 2017 revenues. The company currently expects a 20-bps impact from adverse foreign exchange on net revenue at Covance Drug Development in 2017.LabCorp has been continuously grappling with the issue of rising operating expenses which has affected its margins in the last reported quarter. Also, the chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Meanwhile, on a positive note, LabCorp is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market. In July 2017, LabCorp launched ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life-threatening, acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Also, in May, company expanded its VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio through the addition of 10 new test panels with focus on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes.LabCorp recently teamed up with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) to set up specimen collection service stations at various Walgreens stores across the United States. The company also expanded its reach by closing the acquisition of Mount Sinai Health System Clinical Outreach Laboratories in May 2017. LabCorp’s highly differentiated portfolio will be used by the existing customers of Mount Sinai. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.LabCorp’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should maintain its momentum in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of -1.84%.

691,WBA,"Fred's, Inc.  has been in the red for quite some time now due to sluggish comps. The company has been struggling with declining sales that has been impacting its profits as well as overall growth. Also, it seems that the company is yet to recover from the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger. Such factors have hurt the performance of the company in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that has been pulling down Fred's performance.Dismal Comps Trend and Declining Sales Fred’s has been posting dismal comps since past many quarters, as a result of the sale of low productive discontinued inventory. Declining traffic trends are also hurting comps. We note that the company’s July comp sales declined 0.1%, after posting a decrease of 1.6% in June and 0.8% in May.Sales were also affected by the closure of 39 underperforming stores in the first quarter of 2017. Continued challenges in the Front Store business and competitive consumable categories also affected the top-line. We note that Fred’s reported a year-over-year decline of 2.7%, 3%, 3.1% and 5.3% during March, April, May and June, respectively. The company’s total sales for July declined 3.5% to $150.5 million.Cancelled Merger - A Grave Disappointment Owing to various antitrust issues and unlikely FTC (Federal Trade Commission) clearance, Walgreens Boots Alliance decided not to proceed with its planned takeover of rival drugstore, Rite Aid Corporation. The cancelled Walgreens-Rite Aid merger also closed doors for Fred’s, which had inked a deal in Dec 2016 to buy 865 Rite Aid stores. The acquisition of these stores would have positioned Fred’s Pharmacy as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Fred’s was left disappointed after the cancelled merger, which would have given the company greater negotiating power and would have also improved its healthcare growth strategy.  Moreover, the professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees incurred in connection with this deal, have also become unyielding and have hurt the company’s profits.Less International Exposure Fred’s does not have any presence in the developing markets which deprives it of the benefits of high growth opportunities in the developing nations like China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia. Since the developed markets of Europe, America and Canada are already saturated, most of the U.S. companies are looking toward the emerging ones, which offer great growth opportunity owing to the growing population and affluent middle class.Bottom Line In an effort to revamp its performance, the company has shifted focus to its pharmacy organization to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. Growth strategies of the company also include internal reorganization and geographic expansion.Although such efforts have improved Fred’s specialty business, they are yet to bear a significant impact upon the company’s top-line. Moreover, the management expects that the current headwinds combined with lower-than-expected sales trend would impact second-quarter results. Such weak fundamentals indicate that Fred’s is not a favorable stock currently.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

692,WBA,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 20. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this home furnishings retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 21.1% in the last reported quarter. Further, the company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 37 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 57.1%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.90 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. QuoteNotably, Bed Bath & Beyond has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months, reflecting negative investor sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have plunged 19.7%, against the industry’s growth of 0.8%.Factors at PlayBed Bath & Beyond is not immune to the troubles of the retail sector characterized by soft traffic at stores due to growth of e-commerce, as well as currency headwinds and other macroeconomic concerns. This has led the company to put up a disappointing show in the last several quarters. Notably, the company has posted negative earnings and sales surprises in five of the trailing six quarters.Additionally, Bed Bath & Beyond has been grappling with soft margins for five quarters now. Gross margin in the fiscal second quarter was hampered by higher direct-to-customer shipping expenses, lower merchandise margin and a rise in coupon expense on account of increased redemptions. This along with a rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses caused operating margin to decline for the fifth straight quarter.The dismal first half, the estimated impact from Hurricane Harvey, higher costs related to the company’s new transformation plans and expectations that these trends will persist compelled management to trim forecasts for fiscal 2017. The company now projects net sales growth rate to be flat for fiscal 2017 (which includes a 53rd week), compared with the previous guidance of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.Further, it envisions earnings per share of nearly $3.00, down 30% from the year-ago period. Earlier, the company projected earnings per share to decline in the range of a low-single digits percentage to 10%.Moreover, the company continues to anticipate gross margin to decline in fiscal 2017. It also expects SG&A deleverage on account of higher payroll and payroll-related costs; costs related to technology and buyouts of One Kings and PMall; restructuring charges associated with store management and expenses related to Hurricane Harvey.Nevertheless, the company’s transformation plan is on track to deliver a seamless customer experience. Its capital initiatives and constant shareholder-friendly moves also bode well.Though Bed Bath & Beyond is striving hard to spark a turnaround, the current dismal trends cannot simply be overlooked. So, let’s see what is in store for the company in the upcoming release.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed Bath & Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Bed Bath & Beyond has an Earnings ESP of -1.37% as the Most Accurate estimate of 36 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. This combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NIKE Inc.

693,WBA,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and focuses on investing in key businesses to gain traction and boost profits. In line with this, the company recently entered into an agreement to buy the radioactive diagnostic drug Lymphoseek from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals.We are also encouraged to note that Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive Cardinal Health’s earnings over the long haul. Meanwhile, Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment has been gaining on solid client retention, with the loss of only a few key customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report).Recently, Cordis, a Cardinal Health company, and Medinol announced the receipt of FDA approval of the EluNIR drug-eluting stent (DES) for treating narrowing of or blockage in coronary arteries. Cardinal Health also recently launched the Opioid Action Program.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 18.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry's gain of around 17.4%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues.Also, Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For instance, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from the likes of McKesson and AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

694,WBA,"Brick and mortar retailers have been hit hard by the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) effect and many stores have as a result bitten the dust. Target (TGT  -  Free Report) may have shut a few itself, but that isn’t a good enough reason to think that the retailer has bowed out. The following analysis shows that not only will the company continue fighting, but like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), it will also become a force to reckon with in the increasingly omnichannel retail market.The Turnaround PlanWeak sales, weak gross margins (an indication that the company is heavily discounting goods to move stock, or high procurement cost related to new brands, or both) and relatively steady EPS despite a steadily declining share count aren’t things that inspire confidence. But CEO Brian Cornell has outlined a turnaround plan, and execution appears to be on track.“We’re investing in our business with a long-term view of years and decades, not months and quarters,” Cornell said in a nutshell. “We’re putting digital first and evolving our stores, digital channels and supply chain to work together as a smart network that delivers on everything guests love about Target, including more than a dozen new brands we’ll introduce over the next two years.”For the purpose, he’s earmarked $7 billion for capital expenses over the next three years and a billion more in operating profits, beginning in 2017. So let’s see how he’s doing-Putting Digital FirstThere are two aspects to this, the first being increased digitization of the stores to improve the in-store shopping experience and the second being the building of the online shopping channel to improve that shopping experience.  Target has been working on both.On the store front, it has added RFID (radio frequency identification) tags to apparel to quickly locate in-store inventory and beacons through which location-based information can be transmitted to shoppers while in the store. Now, it’s doing more to remodel the stores so they are to support delivery of orders taken online (more on that later).This year, it’s rolling out new technology in stores that will allow store employees to check inventory, take orders, process payments through a mobile point-of-sale system and arrange delivery. The capability will be expanded to all stores by year-end.On the online shopping front, it has invested in its digital infrastructure to increase its speed, stability, performance and capacity. So today it has a much more functional website and app. This year, it is also integrating its savings app Cartwheel with the main Target shopping app to streamline the shopping experience. It also has a deal with Pinterest that could attract more users.As a result, Target’s digital sales have grown strongly every quarter, doubling between 2013 and 2016.Google AllianceAlthough part of its digital focus, the alliance with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is big enough to warrant separate discussion.Target has expanded and deepened the relationship this year. After testing Google Express (an ecommerce shipping service with no subscription charges and free shipping depending on order size) in select markets across New York and California, it has now announced that Target products can be purchased via Google Express across the country.Come 2018, devices like Google Home, Android and iOS smartphones and smart TVs that come with Google Assistant, can also be used to shop Target using voice commands. Also in 2018, Google Express will integrate Target REDcard, so holders can grab their related special discounts and offers.The Google agreement is particularly significant because the tech giant already has a ton of data on individuals that it will use to personalize offers and discounts. It’s also building augmented reality apps that can greatly improve the shopping experience. Target, with its focus on stylish home, apparel and beauty products at reasonable prices, can benefit hugely.Additionally, with Google Express and Assistant, customers have more choice than Amazon Prime and Alexa, because they can choose products from a number of retailers like Walmart, Target, Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and PetSmart depending on price, availability, convenience (whether they want to pick up at the nearest store or get it delivered) and other criteria. So the deal allows Target to become part of a larger basket.Evolving StoresOf the 1,800 stores Target is operating today, it plans to remodel more than a 1,000 by 2020 (600 by 2019). It also plans to operate 130 additional small-format stores by 2019. The target for this year is to remodel 110 stores and open 30 small-format stores.The remodeling entails reorganization of the backroom so it can double as a hyper-local delivery hub. Now, this space is being optimized to build a ship-from-store capability (shipping from the nearest store when a customer orders online to minimize delivery time and cost). Target has said that 1,400 stores already offer this capability and by 2019, all stores will have it.All stores already support the order pickup facility (where a customer chooses to pick up the item at the store after ordering it online). Ship-from-store and order pickup are already taking care of more than half the digital sales volume today although it’s expected to peak during the holidays.The smaller format stores are being opened in densely populated urban areas and college campuses and they are open for long hours (7AM to midnight). The goal is to allow customers to make quick purchases of every day essentials-type of things. On college campuses, the goal is to lure young consumers to the Target brand. They also operate as pickup centers for online orders.Creating a Smart NetworkThe revamped stores and online channels are increasingly woven into a smart network that allows Target to offer many fulfillment options. So customers can now opt for in-store pickup; drive-up (where a store employee takes the order out to the customer’s car); same-day delivery in select locations and for select items including fresh groceries; next-day delivery; Target Restock, where the company takes orders for essentials up to 7PM every day for delivery on the following day; and Google Express. As the supply chain gets smarter, the in-stock position improves so it is also able to expand the number of products eligible for next-day delivery.Focus on EmployeesRetail has forever been about having the right products in the right place and at the right time. But now, it isn’t just about products anymore because people are increasingly also looking for a good experience. Therefore, it is important to retain good employees with the requisite knowledge and experience. It therefore started investing in its people. The company recently raised the minimum wage to $11 an hour as part of an initiative to raise it to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. It is also investing in training employees for better guest satisfaction.More Than a Dozen New BrandsThe private label market is exploding with supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores like Amazon all jumping in. The concept is also a very big deal in Europe where it was used effectively by German chains Aldi and Lidl.To tap this opportunity, Target has said that it plans to launch 12 new store brands. The advantage of these brands is that customers can’t get them anywhere except from Target, so once brand loyalty is built, it results in repeat customers. Other advantages include a greater control over product creation, time to market and pricing, translating into stronger profitability.  The fact that millennial shoppers are less attached to the brands their parents swore by makes this that much easier to do.Target’s private labels focus on its most profitable apparel and home categories and include the kids clothing line Cat & Jack, the kids bedding and home collection line of more than 1,200 pieces of furniture (including 12 themes) Pillowfort, the baby brand Cloud Island, women's apparel brand A New Day, menswear line Goodfellow & Co., homewares brand Project 62, athleisure brand Joy Lab and home and lifestyle brand Hearthand Hand with Magnolia. Cat & Jack, which has been around the longest, racked up $2 billion in sales in its very first year since launch. With eight of the twelve already launched, Target will see the effect in the holidays and through 2018, when we’ll know more about how they did.There are also four more to go, and according to recent trademarks, they could reportedly be ""Universal Thread"" or ""Universal Thread Goods Co.,"" United Thread and an Obvious Foods rebranding. The company generally focuses on style, wellness, baby and kids products, so its private labels are unlikely to venture too far from these.ConclusionAll of the above point to the fact that Target is poised for some big changes in 2018. It has most of the pieces in its turnaround plan on the board, now it just needs to tie it all together. Two metrics are particularly interesting in this respect: digital sales, which continue to grow at strong double digits despite tougher comps and two straight quarters of traffic growth, indicating that customers are returning to Target.As far as the Amazon effect is concerned, it’s worth knowing that ecommerce is still just 8.1% of total retail sales, according to the commerce department. Yes, it’s causing disruption, but Target has finally jumped on the bandwagon and the changes it has embraced (along with suitable advertising) should help the company get back on track. Add to that the fact that not all retailers will be able to weather the storm so Target has scope to grab share.Note that the company also returns cash to investors both as share repurchases and dividends. So the fact that it is catching up with leading trends increases confidence that there is no risk to the income.The way things stand now, it does appear that Target is entering buy territory. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereWall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Within this segment, total sales at comparable drugstores rose 3.7%, while prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew 8.3% on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations. On the other hand, comparable retail stores edged down 0.4% due to lower sales of consumables and general merchandise category and at the personal care category, partially offset by higher sales in the health and wellness and beauty categories.Pharmacy sales, which accounted for 69.9% of the division’s sales in the quarter, increased 10.3% from the year-ago quarter, while pharmacy sales at comparable stores increased 5.8% on higher volumes.Revenues at the Retail Pharmacy International division declined 10.3% on a year-over-year basis (down 0.2% at CER) to $2.8 billion, on account of currency fluctuations.

696,WBA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) has set a major milestone to expand global footprint with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On successful completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens’ worldwide retail pharmacy business.Following this news, shares of Walgreens rose 1.24% to reach $71.05 on Dec 6.Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPGC).Financial TermsThis 40% minority stake in GuoDa will be purchased by Walgreens for through a capital increase of worth $416 million, subject to certain regulatory review and approval plus other customary closing conditions. Upon completion, Walgreens would account for this stake as an equity method investment.China Retail Market at a GlancePer a report by IBISWorld, revenues for the Pharmacy and Drugstore industry in China have been growing at an annualized rate of 16.6% over the past five years now. Per the report, substantial growth in demand for drugs in domestic retail purchase, relatively expensive drug prices in hospitals and increasing self-medication rate are major factors spurring this stupendous growth.Prospects With GuoDaPer Walgreens, GuoDa as China’s leading pharmacy chain is going to contribute to its global pharmacy expertise. Incidentally, Walgreens already has a strong base in China, courtesy of its merger with Alliance Boots. This latest development with GuoDa will further strengthen its business in this densely populated region. The company is particularly excited about its opportunity to invest in the country’s fast-growing retail pharmacy sector.Share Price  Over the past three months, Walgreens has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has lost 12.7%, narrower than the industry’s 13.5% decline during this period.Declining sales at the Retail Pharmacy International was a disappointment leading to a drop in the share price of the company in the recent past. We expect this to improve a little with the latest strategic decision by Walgreens.Zacks Rank and Key PicksWalgreens carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Myriad Genetics, Inc.

697,WBA,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), the Illinois-based leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens has outperformed its industry with respect to share price movement in the last month. The stock has gained 1.7%, ahead of the industry’s 1% rise during the period. Walgreens’ shelving of the $17 billion Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) acquisition deal came as a huge setback to the company’s investors. The buyout deal had once promised a strong platform for developing the company’s brand presence as well as its overall future business growth. However, delving into the deal’s latest  details, we believe there is still much to hope for.The new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half of the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. More specifically, the acquirer will take over nearly 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and a related inventory from Rite Aid for $5.175 billion in cash. Notably, the latter ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.This apart, the contract’s financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, Walgreens expects it to be modestly accretive to its adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year. Synergies from this new takeover are expected in excess of $400 million, to be entirely realized within three to four years of its initial closing.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge.Besides, the company’s new strategic pharmacy tie-ups and several recent programs including skin product launch and vaccination are encouraging. Earlier this year, the company partnered with communication service provider WPP to operate and develop multiple marketing and communications channels for its retail and wholesale businesses as well as its health and beauty product brands.Walgreens Boots also inked a multi-year partnership agreement with global express delivery service provider FedEx Corporation. The alliance is aimed at offering convenient access to FedEx drop-off and pickup services at several Walgreens Boots locations across the United States.In the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering the company’s margin significantly. Also, Walgreens Boots faces obstacles like increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain a decent market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants namely Target and Wal-Mart are on track to expand their pharmacy businesses.Risks from other channels such as supermarkets and mail order operations also pose a threat. In addition, industry conditions remain challenging as insurers slash reimbursement rates and raise prescription co-payments. Plus, currency fluctuations, weak macroeconomic environment and delay of Walgreens Boots’ long impending buyout of Rite Aid emerge as other headwinds.Key PicksSome of the better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). While Align Technology sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEXX Laboratories carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. The stock has gained around 6.8% over the last six months.Lantheus Holdings has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.5%. The stock has surged 70.4% over the last six months.Align Technology has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 26.6%. The stock has rallied roughly 22.3% over the last three months.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

698,WBA,"Fred’s Inc  is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6, before the opening bell.We note that Fred’s delivered losses in the past five quarters. Further, the company has been struggling with murky comparable-store sales (comps).While the company has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters, let’s look into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is pegged at a loss of 15 cents, which has widened by a penny over the past 30 days. However, estimated loss for the quarter under review is lower than the prior year adjusted loss of 27 cents.Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $500.5 million, down 3.1% from the year-ago period.Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fred's, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Fred’s has been delivering dismal comps since past many quarters, owing to declining traffic trends, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and rise in generic dispensing rate. Additionally, the company’s store expansion plans were gravely impacted by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. Had the deal materialized, Fred’s would have emerged as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).We note that comparable store sales dipped 1.2% and 0.3% during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017. The company’s weak comps trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as well.Nevertheless, Fred’s has been advancing with initiatives to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and boost free cash flow. Further, the company has been trying to organize pharmacy business to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. Although such efforts seem promising, they are yet to bear significant impacts upon the company’s performance.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fred’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Fred’s carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

700,WBA,"Before we tick down the list of new Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell this morning, another metric pointing to a strengthening economy: a positive read on September (preliminary) Durable Goods Orders. Results came out way ahead of expectations at +2.2%; analysts had been looking for +0.8%. Removing the more-volatile transportation goods totals, we still see +0.7%, which is again a healthy number. Ex-capital goods, non-Defense, ex-aircraft came in at +1.3%.These numbers indicate that factories look to be busier manufacturing hard products, which spells sunny days ahead for industrial and commercial companies, their workforces and their shareholders. Whatever doubt remains about a new Fed hike coming round the bend is even further quashed. The domestic economy is finally living up to its potential, after years of sluggish growth.Q3 Earnings BonanzaThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), speaking of durable goods, topped expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $2.72 per share beat the $2.65 Zacks consensus estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. Revenues reached $24.31 billion versus the $24.06 billion expected. The premier aircraft manufacturer also upped full-year guidance by a dime to $9.90 - 10.10 per share. Lower backlog quarter over quarter — an important metric for a company that makes such huge and expensive items — helped its Q3 results. Shares are up modestly at this hour; bear in mind BA stock has skyrocketed 70% since 2017 began.Fiscal Q4 2017 results from Visa (V  -  Free Report) also beat earnings and sales estimates, with 90 cents per share up 5 cents over the Zacks consensus and +15.4% from a year ago. Net operational revenues rose 14% year over year to $4.9 billion, higher than the $4.62 billion we were looking for. Visa continues its pristine earnings performance, having averaged an 8.4% positive surprise in its trailing four quarters. Visa shares are up another 1% in the early session, and are up nearly 40% year to date.Defense major Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) posted a huge earnings beat: $3.68 per share was far ahead of the expected $2.92, whereas quarterly sales of $6.53 billion came in higher than the $6.32 billion anticipated. Northrop also cranked up its full-year earnings guidance notably — from $12.10 - 12.40 per share previously to $12.90 - 13.10 this morning. NOC shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in the current pre-market.Coca Cola (KO) also beat on top and bottom lines, albeit less impressively by comparison. Earnings of 50 cents per share topped estimates by a penny, whereas revenues for the quarter $9.1 billion from the expected $8.84 billion. Organic growth of 4% and improved results from its Sprite brand were the notable takeaways. Coke has now beaten earnings estimates 4 times in the last 5 quarters.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) — the parent company of pharma retailer Walgreen’s — posted an impressive earnings beat of $1.31 per share, compared to the $1.22 expected, up 22.4% year over year. Sales of $30.15 billion outpaced the $30.05 in the Zacks estimate, up 5.3% year over year. Strong retail pharma sales in the U.S. was somewhat offset by weaker International sales. But WBA shares are up markedly in today’s early session, nearly +4%.

Within this segment, total sales at comparable drugstores rose 3.1%, while prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew 8.7% on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings is pegged at $5.48, within but near to the lower end of the company’s guided range.Our TakeWalgreens Boots reported an impressive fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with both earnings and sales surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, declining sales at the Retail Pharmacy International was a disappointment. Nevertheless, Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.In September, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total of $4.375 billion. Synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years of initial closing of the transaction, achieved majorly from procurement, cost savings and other operational areas. Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract is in line with its growth strategy and offers additional operational benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Walgreens Boots has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

702,WBA,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) revealed that it is now accepting Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Apple Pay as a mode of payment on its website. This marks another step in the drugstore chain’s omni-channel initiatives. Notably, the company began using Apple Pay in its stores in 2015, when it also announced plans to use Google Wallet.Why Apple Pay Online?Rite Aid resorted to accepting Apple Pay online, as customers are using their smartphones to make transactions. In fact, management stated that over half of its website visitors access www.riteaid.com from their mobiles, the most being iPhone users. Notably, Apple Pay’s operations is currently spread across 15 nations including Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Singapore and the United States among others.Thus, accepting this most popular digital wallet is likely to be beneficial to Rite Aid, which apparently is the first pharmacy retailer to use this payment option online. Per the announcement, customers can purchase from an array of about 12,000 Rite Aid products at its online store and check out by tapping the Apple Pay payment button. Per sources, the option will be available for customers using Mac, iPhone, or iPad with certain specifications.Can the New Payment Method Aid Rite Aid’s Performance?We believe that this digital payment option should aid Rite Aid’s performance, which hasn’t been very impressive of late. The company’s bottom line has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters, including two quarters of negative earnings surprise. Though the bottom line matched the Zacks consensus mark in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reported a loss of 1 cent as against the year-ago period earnings of 3 cents per share. Rite Aid’s bottom line has declined year over year for over a year now.Additionally, the top line remained soft in the second quarter, with same store sales falling on account of lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Well, Rite Aid has been posting year-over-year decline in sales for two straight quarters now due to lower same store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Apart from these factors, Rite Aid’s second-quarter debacle also could be attributable to the impact of the failed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report).Owing to these factors, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has plunged 77.8% year to date, much worse than the industry’s decline of 13.1%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Nevertheless, acceptance of Apple Pay on its website underscores Rite Aid’s focus on undertaking endeavors to enhance consumers’ experience and resonate with their evolving demands. In fact, this step seems to be well-timed, given the speculations of Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entry in the drugstore business. Let’s see if this can help improve Rite Aid’s top-line and drive its overall performance.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

(WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.53%. It is worth noting that Walgreens has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.63%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market in the last reported quarter. Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw the highest comparable prescription growth in more than seven years.Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts and volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteBased on a promising performance in the preceding quarter, Walgreens Boots raised the low end of its guidance for fiscal 2017 by 8 cents and currently expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 reflects a 14% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $30.09 billion reflects a 5.1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.However, the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint. The reduction in government pharmacy funding in the U.K. has been affecting performance. In absence of any near-term catalyst, we expect the scenario to persist in the upcoming quarter as well.We also note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots' margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressures as well as generic drug cost inflation have been denting margins. In the third quarter of 2017, Walgreens Boots' gross margin contracted on account of reimbursement pressure and price inflation of branded drugs.Management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy's gross profit due to lower margin products. Although the company is working to boost efficiency and provide high-quality, cost-effective pharmacy services, the near-term outlook remains bleak.Meanwhile, market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase. Also, in order to expand its footprint in Asia, the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea in April 2017. This development is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.In September 2017, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total value of $4.375 billion.

704,WBA,"Drugstore chain, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) may seem like the fabled forbidden fruit of Eden for most at the moment, particularly after its merger deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) fell apart on Jun 29. Concurrently, the company also reported dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 results and entered a fresh deal with Walgreens to sell 2,186 stores to the latter.The whole chain of events has drastically impacted the stock’s performance as evident from the 20% decline witnessed since the announcement. Further, the company has significantly underperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry’s fall of 1.4% in the same time frame. Looking back, Rite Aid has declined as much as 67.4% in the last one year, compared with the industry’s fall of 15.7%. Let’s delve a little deeper and try to understand the reasons behind the slump.Reasons for the DeclineAs already stated, Rite Aid and Walgreens terminated its long-standing merger agreement following the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) closed door meeting on Jun 28, which dropped hints on the minimal chances of the deal being approved.The deal has been awaiting FTC’s approval ever since the announcement of the agreement in Oct 2015. FTC’s concerns were mainly regarding the lack of a strong competitor in the drugstore space. With Walgreens and Rite Aid being the second and third-largest drugstore chains in the U.S., the FTC believed the merger could give rise to a duopoly, leaving behind the industry leader (by size) – CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).Further, Rite Aid’s dismal earnings results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, released simultaneously, disappointed investors. The company posted adjusted loss of 5 cents per share for the first quarter that was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents. Further, this compared unfavorably with the year-ago period earnings of 2 cents. Additionally, the top line remained soft, with comps declining on account of lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Moreover, unfavorable reimbursement rates continued to strain margins, as evident from the 100 basis points contraction in the adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter.Will the New Deal Provide Some Solace?While Walgreens and Rite Aid called off the merger, the two major industry players entered into another fresh deal. Per the deal, Walgreens will buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory. This all-cash deal worth $5.175 billion is expected to conclude in six months, on a cash-free and debt-free basis. Apart from this, Rite Aid will also get termination charges of $325 million from Walgreens, in cash.Management expects the new agreement to place the company as an independent drugstore chain, alongside being a pharmacy benefit manager with robust control in core markets. Well, Rite Aid will continue to operate its pharmacy benefit manager – EnvisionRX, RediClinic and Health Dialog. Further, the company intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt, thus improving leverage levels, easing balance sheet and improving financial flexibility.All said, this deal is likely to make Rite Aid a smaller, yet stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of the aforementioned unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates.ConclusionWell, though the new deal is definitely a breather for the troubled drugstore chain, whether the companies’ succeed in getting FTC’s approval on this deal is yet to be seen. Further, if approved, how Rite Aid revives its troubled income statement and operations as an individual company will decide its fate. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader Retail-Wholesale space is Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Further, the company’s long-term EPS growth rate of 15.9% and share price growth of 7.1% in the last six months help it to stand strong in the industry. Moreover, the company flaunts a superb earnings surprise history.
