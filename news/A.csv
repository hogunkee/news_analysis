12,A,"After a strong rebound since March 2, the stock market took a rest on Tuesday. The major indexes took losses of 0.6% to 1% in heavier turnover vs. Monday. Several top-rated stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold above or close to recent buy points.While Broadcom (AVGO) is receiving tons of media attention on news that President Trump ordered to block a potential megamerger with Qualcomm (QCOM), industry-mate Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has quietly broken out of a 15-week double-bottom base that features a 124.54 buy point.In a good double bottom, the second sell-off must undercut the first initial decline. Monolithic certainly did that: The base's second low of 103.14 went below the first low of 105.01.The stock found solid support at the 200-day moving average, and the base features symmetry. A third positive trait: The overall decline in the base is a mild 18.7% from head to toe.Monolithic, an expert in mixed-signal circuits including DC converters, LED drivers and audio amplifiers, holds a 97 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup in IBD's fabless semiconductors industry group. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% to 77 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) is trying to clear a cup base that shows a 21.23 entry. This base is unique, particularly on a daily chart.

Yet the stock has a volatile streak, so the jagged price action can generally be treated as a cup.Second, as seen only on a daily chart, it formed a tight handle, starting with a down day on Feb. 28. That produced a 20.42 entry, a dime above the handle's intraday high. Volume on the breakout from that early buy point was light.San Diego-based Halozyme specializes in recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery, encrinology and oncology fields of medicine. It turned profitable in recent quarters. The small-cap firm posted earnings of 2 cents and 85 cents a share in Q3 and Q4 last year, respectively.The Dow Jones transportation average outperformed on Tuesday, rising 0.5%. Airlines gave the sector index a nice push up. Ryanair (RYAAY) is building a cup base that appears to have made two handles. The most recent handle has a 125.32 entry.The Irish discount carrier is one of the highest-rated companies in IBD's airline group, which has moved from 88th to 34th over the past six weeks in terms of six-month performance. Ryanair, a large cap with a $29 billion market value, has posted four straight quarters of profit growth, averaging 28% per quarter. Q1 profit is seen climbing 27% to 28 cents a share.Meanwhile, real estate data provider Zillow (Z), highlighted in this column on March 5, has now rallied 17% past a breakout from a solid cup with handle and a 48.59 buy point.

15,A,"Coming up with brilliant ideas is hard enough when you have lots of time. But when you're under pressure to produce breakthroughs, tension can mount.Leaders know they cannot demand instant innovation. Instead, they need to nurture a supportive environment for employees to think creatively and experiment freely.If you're seeking quick results, create a sense of urgency without setting unrealistic expectations for your team.To encourage innovation when facing a ticking clock:Tamp down the frenzy. Even if you're privately worried about an approaching deadline or a looming competitive threat, convey outward confidence in your colleagues to come through in the clutch. Calmly explain the need for fast output without adding to everyone's anxiety.""When the brain is under stress, it can't operate as creatively,"" said Stephen Shapiro, author of ""Best Practices Are Stupid."" To optimize innovation, he suggests alleviating stress for you and your team by taking walks, yoga classes and relaxation breaks.Simplify the issue. Potential innovators operate best when they understand exactly what they're trying to accomplish. Make their job easier by directing their attention to what matters most — and jettisoning the rest.""Get your team to rally around the problem that you want to solve,"" said Shapiro, a professional speaker based in Orlando, Fla. ""The brain loves focus. Otherwise, we innovate by meandering all over the place.""Adopt counterintuitive measures. If you're under the gun, you may demand that employees crank out dozens of ideas immediately. But insisting that they meet a certain quota is misguided.Shapiro cites a leader who asked associates to propose 40 new product ideas within a week. They couldn't deliver so much output, so soon.""He then decided to take them to lay on the grass with notebooks, look up at the clouds and jot their ideas,"" he said. ""That worked better because they were able to focus on quality, not quantity.""Convey excitement, not desperation. When racing against time to devise innovative solutions, emphasize the positive aspects of the situation. Talk about what's to gain by capitalizing on opportunity rather than conjuring negative outcomes and cautioning your team to avoid a calamity.""When leaders keep saying 'Stakes are high' and 'Time is tight' it doesn't produce the results they want,"" Shapiro said. ""When pounding people with a threat, they can't be as creative.""Ditch formalities. When confronting a time crunch, abandon standard operating procedures — and free your team to brainstorm in new ways.""Innovation is unpredictable and can be messy,"" said Amy Radin, author of ""The Change Maker's Playbook."" ""So set aside the things that have always been done, the processes that are based on predictability and avoiding risk.""If you usually spur innovation by holding highly structured off-site meetings, for example, replace those retreats with a series of smaller test runs. Staging more short-term trials — and pulling out early if initial results prove underwhelming — encourages bolder experimentation.Rather than have your team present new ideas using an elaborate slideshow, try sharing ideas in five-minute standup gatherings. That way, you let employees articulate succinctly why their suggestion has merit — and avoid long meetings driven by dense slides.Maintain an open mind. Beware of letting your preconceived notions color your judgment. Consider proposals that initially strike you as too vague or imprecise — and give people a chance to run low- or no-cost pilot projects.""You have to trade off precision for speed,"" Radin said.

From there, the ranking at the start of each month has been 23 in February and then 22, 26, 45, again 45 and 39.Going into Friday's session, the credit-card group was No. 37.Two of the credit card stocks recently appeared in the Stock Spotlight screen.Mastercard (MA) is rated No. 1 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The stock has some of the characteristics of a turnaround stock, though the negative side isn't bad enough to fit the definition.For example, annual earnings growth slowed to 11% and 7% in 2015-16. Last year, earnings growth picked up to 24%. The Street expects 38% growth this year.Pretax margin was 53.6% last year, the third highest in the past nine years. (The year 2013 was the peak at 55.1%.)The stock chart has some bullish traits. Mastercard completed a three-weeks-tight pattern June 22 and crossed above the 204.10 buy point Wednesday. The 3-weeks-tight is a secondary entry, which is ideal for adding shares to an existing position.Another plus is the relative strength line. The RS line is at a high, which is bullish. The line compares a stock's price action vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.USA Technologies (USAT) also is in the payment processor group.

18,A,"The ""gig economy,"" RIP. Well, maybe.As you'll recall, the gig economy refers to a radical transformation of the nature of work and U.S. labor markets. Digital platforms better match workers with jobs (aka, gigs). Uber was, and is, the prototype of this upheaval.Its existence seemed confirmed. One survey by well-regarded labor economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Alan Krueger of Princeton estimated that the share of U.S. workers in various ""alternative work arrangements"" rose from 10.7% of total employment in 2005 to 15.8% in 2015. That's a big deal.Opinion has been divided. Supporters found many virtues. Workers would work when they wanted. Companies could better calibrate their work forces to their needs. Productivity would improve. Critics were unpersuaded. A bigger gig economy, they argued, would reduce job security and fringe benefits (health insurance, retirement accounts).But suddenly, the debate has imploded; the gig economy may be a myth. A new survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that, in 2017, the share of workers in ""alternative employment arrangements"" (gig jobs and other) was 10.1% of total employment, almost exactly what it was in 2005 (10.7%) and 1995 (9.9%). Whatever Uber and other digital platforms are doing, they haven't altered long-term trends.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 1995 survey, the first of its kind by the BLS, defined ""traditional"" job as permanent employment on a firm's payroll. ""Alternative"" jobs fell into four groups: (1) on-call workers — for example, seasonal workers; (2) independent contractors — freelancers, self-employed consultants; (3) temps — people paid by a temp agency but who physically work at another company; and (4) contract firms that provide services to other firms (examples: security guards or cafeteria workers).Look at the table below. It shows that, as a share of total employment, these types of jobs have remained remarkably stable. Independent contractors are the largest single group, representing 6.9% of total employment in 2017 compared with 7.4% in 2005 and 6.7% in 1995.""The nature of work hasn't fundamentally changed,"" argues Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research and advocacy organization. ""Freelancing and gig work are not taking over.""To be fair, there is no widely accepted definition of what constitutes a ""gig"" job. As a result, the gig debate can be highly confusing. Doubtlessly, Uber and similar websites have altered employment trends, but the effect is apparently much less than the perception. One explanation is that many Uber drivers regard their earnings as a second source of income, and the BLS survey counted only workers whose jobs provided their main source of income. Uber-like jobs have been undercounted.True. But correcting for this bias may not make much difference.In a study, Mishel reports that although Uber has about 833,000 drivers in a year, most drive only part-time and for part of the year. Taking the high turnover into account, he estimates that the number of Uber drivers is equivalent to 90,521 full-time workers. Even including similar jobs at other companies, that's only about 0.1% of full-time U.S. employment — one-tenth of 1%. Hardly a revolution.The BLS expects to publish more data on computer-driven job creation later this year. This may clarify what the gig economy is or isn't. For the moment, it's best to regard the gig economy as modestly adding to the economy's flexibility, for better or worse.It enables households to tap a second source of income when they need it — when they've had unanticipated expenses or the economy dips into a recession. But the same flexibility abets job insecurity. Employers can maintain a cushion of workers — temps, contract workers or whatever — who can be more easily fired if prospects worsen.It's also clear that the various alternative work arrangements are not substitutes for each other, the BLS found. Independent contractors were older and four-fifths preferred their current status to a traditional job; by contrast, temporary work agency workers were younger, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and only about two-fifths preferred their current work status.There is a larger lesson. Be suspicious of the scribbling and chattering class (of which this reporter is obviously a member). It's in the business of discovering and popularizing new social, political and economic trends. Sometimes our need to be noticed exaggerates trends that, when examined closely, barely exist.Other columns by Robert SamuelsonMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

19,A,"Like psychologists, advisors can find themselves in intimate conversations with clients. To do their job, they need to listen raptly and gather highly personal information.Some clients speak freely about the most sensitive issues. Others prefer to avoid certain topics altogether.By building trust and not passing judgment, advisors learn more from even the most reluctant clients. The key is making individuals feel comfortable opening up and revealing their innermost secrets.""Advisors need to create a safe atmosphere,"" said Lynn Dunston, a certified financial planner in Denver, Colo. ""We're letting them know we want to interact on a human level.""When leading these get-to-know-you meetings, Dunston begins by making three points. He assures them of confidentiality, emphasizes he won't judge what they say and thanks them in advance for sharing.""They usually respond with a sigh of relief and say, 'That's good to know,' "" he said.His third point — thanking them for confiding in him — wields a special power. Many clients appreciate a sincere expression of gratitude and feel less guarded as a result.""I want them to know that I'm honored to hear their stories,"" Dunston said. ""And when they share their stories, I thank them again. It shows I don't take that for granted. And that brings us closer.""Dunston has learned that by remaining quiet, clients are more apt to talk. Even if they veer off-topic, he stays silent and does not interrupt.Because financial planners spend much of their day dishing out advice, it's natural to want to offer guidance to clients grappling with difficulty. But if they feel hesitant opening up, it's often best to restrain the urge to advise.Clients may need time to weigh whether to broach a painful subject, such as their troubled marriage or a family tragedy. Advisors who strike an attentive pose signal that they are ready to listen.""I learned early in my career to match and mirror clients' body posture,"" Dunston said. ""If they lean forward, I lean forward. It signals, 'I hear you. I'm with you. I want to hear more.' ""The setting also plays a role. If clients feel relaxed in your environment, they're less likely to withhold sensitive information.Shelly Terzolo, an advisor in Syracuse, N.Y., meets with clients around a table rather than from behind a desk. She offers them a beverage and lets them steer the conversation.""I don't start off by opening a folder with a long questionnaire,"" she said. ""I just have a notepad and a pen, and I'll move it aside to set the stage for them to feel comfortable in the space.""She has found that some clients are less inclined to open up if they see her writing notes as they speak. By maintaining friendly eye contact, she strengthens her bond with them.Part of the challenge for advisors is prompting clients to flesh out their thoughts and feelings on a delicate matter. In many cases, individuals will not tackle a tender subject head-on; instead, they will hem and haw until they feel ready to address the core issue.With a compassionate nod of the head, Terzolo shows her sympathy while allowing clients to elaborate. Her goal is to assure them that she cares and wants to help.""I don't want them to feel bad that they brought it up,"" she said.Flexibility pays off as well. Advisors may plan for a meeting to focus on investment strategy, but a preoccupied client may raise an entirely different and more personal concern.""You can't say to someone who talks about some trauma or horrible situation with their family, 'Oh, that's too bad. Let's get back to that $4 million in your 401(k),' "" said Nancy Coutu, a certified financial planner in Oak Brook, Ill. ""I might be the first person they've told this to.""At the same time, Coutu knows not to press clients to divulge more. Observing their nonverbal cues helps her build rapport and avoid awkward moments.""I read body language,"" she said. ""If they're wrestling in their seat and not making eye contact, I'll move on and not keep asking about that. I may come back to it later.""Coutu lays the groundwork for more searching conversations by having new clients complete a questionnaire and bring it to their first appointment. Glancing at their responses might trigger an icebreaker such as, ""I see you have five kids.""""Rather than dive into money, I start by acknowledging the information they've already shared,"" Coutu said.

Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses these platforms out to pharmaceutical companies like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). As of June 2018, Ligand has a year of both double-digit sales and earnings growth under its belt.Ligand and Supernus both have IBD Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

22,A,"The escalating trade war between the United States and China poses crucial, though unanswerable, questions: Is this the beginning of the end of the post-World War II international trading system or will the present arrangements survive, as they have for 70 years?Almost certainly, historians will judge favorably the postwar expansion of trade (it has never been completely ""free"" but has been liberalized substantially by removing many tariffs and quotas). It helped lift hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty and cemented the Cold War alliance of democratic societies against communism.Now, however, two problems cloud its future.First, global economic growth has slowed considerably, while inequality has increased. International trade and investment — aka ""globalization"" — are now blamed (often unfairly) for these setbacks.Second, China has burst onto the global economy, rising from a backward country four decades ago to the world's second largest economy. But its ascendancy, aside from challenging the United States (still No. 1), has been controversial, because China practices mercantilism: government policies intended to give its companies an advantage on global markets.President Trump portrays these policies — subsidies, trade preferences and the illicit acquisition of foreign technologies — as monstrously unfair to U.S. workers and firms. Unless China overhauls its economy to make competition more even-handed, Trump vows to do the job himself by imposing stiff tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States (in effect: taxes on China's U.S.-bound exports).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat's where we are now. Trade negotiations between the two countries have broken down, and Trump has announced 25% tariffs on a long list of Chinese exports, from soybeans to semiconductors to plastics. When fully phased in, the affected exports would total about $50 billion. The Chinese said they would retaliate with similar tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports.Trump responded by asking the U.S. trade representative to prepare a further list of $200 billion of Chinese exports to be hit with 10% tariffs. If China retaliated, Trump threatened to add another $200 billion of Chinese exports.Nothing like this has happened since World War II. If this isn't a ""trade war,"" what is it?Whether it portends an end to postwar trading system is unclear. Many economists are skeptical. They also doubt the trade war will plunge the U.S. economy into recession. The direct effect of the tariffs — which will raise prices, inspire retaliation and dampen some production — is ""tiny,"" says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for IHS Markit, a consulting firm.Do some simple arithmetic, he says. A 25% tariff (tax) on $50 billion of Chinese exports totals $12.5 billion; another 10% on $200 billion of exports is $20 billion. Together, that's $32.5 billion, not much in a $20 trillion U.S. economy.Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics agrees but warns that imposing tariffs on most Chinese exports (around $500 billion in 2017) could cause a recession. So could some of his other trade proposals. These include, a 25% tariff on car imports and a repudiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada. The car tariffs alone could cost as many as 550,000 jobs, he says.There is a real dilemma: China's mercantilist policies are bad, but so are Trump's proposed remedies.The view that the present trade war won't become more destructive assumes that China and the United States will find a middle ground that allows both to declare victory. But this is hardly guaranteed. ""Even though it's an authoritarian country, public opinion (in China) matters,"" says economist David Dollar of the Brookings Institution. China's leaders can't be seen as capitulating to Trump. Trump probably feels the same way toward China.The defining characteristics of the postwar trading system have been reductions in trade barriers and the adoption of jointly-agreed upon rules, now enforced through the World Trade Organization (WTO), about what's fair trade and what isn't. The United States played the leading role in this global project, though there has long been frustration with the rules' complexity and their slow-motion operation.""The United States seems to be giving up on the WTO rules — which we helped create. Other countries may do the same,"" says economist Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College and author of ""Clashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.""This would signal an unraveling of the postwar trading system and its replacement by a hodgepodge of bilateral and regional trading agreements — many already exist — with what consequences no one knows. The history of warfare is a long string of miscalculations by combatants on all sides. The same may also be true of trade wars.Other columns by Robert SamuelsonMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

28,A,"This week's big planned Trump administration announcement of emergency investment and export rules targeting China is out, and it doesn't include any rules or even mention China. By now it should be clear that Trump is bending over backwards to soothe Beijing and avoid a China trade war.Instead of detailing tough new emergency measures, including a reported 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology, Trump will instead back legislation moving through Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.In a statement that never mentions China, Trump noted, ""certain countries direct and facilitate systematic investment in United States companies and assets in order to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property in industries those countries deem important.""Last week, Trump called members of Congress to the White House to stop them from interfering with his plan to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs at communications equipment firm ZTE put at risk by U.S. sanctions.Trump's moves appear designed to facilitate progress in trade negotiations ahead of a July 6 Trump tariff deadline that may dramatically intensify the emerging China trade war. On that date, the U.S. is to impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports, with tariffs on another $16 billion in goods due shortly thereafter. China has said it will match Trump tariffs dollar for dollar, whenever they are imposed.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all rallied early Wednesday on hopes that Trump's move to delay investment and export restrictions might keep the China trade war on the back burner. But they reversed sharply lower as the bond yield curve narrowed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Trump had been ""spooked"" by Monday's market sell-off, which helped spur the change in plans.Trump has already made clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would  ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy.Trump's latest decision could be a reprieve for the semiconductor sector. Chip equipment from key U.S. suppliers Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) was seen as one likely area for controlling exports. Chinese companies account for about 6% of the group's sales.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.On Tuesday, the House cleared the modernized CFIUS bill, which now will move to a conference merging it with a Senate-passed bill.Trump's statement said that ""such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE: Dow Jones Futures: 5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedStocks Strengthen In Afternoon; Netflix, Apple, Intuitive Surgical Lead Nasdaq 100Faster Than Concorde: Boeing Hypersonic Jet Concept Would Cross Atlantic In 2 HoursTesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

32,A,"You may have heard the saying, ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in the dog."" (Substitute ""cat"" for ""dog"" if you'd like.)Can this wisdom apply to stocks? In a way, perhaps yes.When you want to find stocks with the biggest potential to rocket to serious gains in a solid market uptrend, you must target those companies with the biggest quarterly and annual increases in earnings and sales. This, in fact, is the C and the A in the IBD CAN SLIM investment model, or current and annual growth in earnings and revenue.Investing those with ""Big C"" and ""Big A"" often means you'll have to accept the risks in buying small- and midcap companies. But the rewards, when you time the market properly and use charts correctly, are well worth the financial adventure.Take Pfizer (PFE), a former market leader, most recently so in the mid-to-late-1990s. It made big gains following peppy breakouts. Yet after peaking at 50.04 in April 1999, the New York-based pharmaceutical giant has virtually sat out much of the bull market runs.Take a look at its annual fundamentals, and you immediately understand why.Pfizer has grown its top line just once in the past seven years. In 2016, sales went up 8%. Earnings have not grown the way they did two decades ago. The company is still a giant, though, with $15.5 billion in net profit and $52 billion in revenue last year. (You can read more about Pfizer as a promising dividends play in IBD's Income Investor column last week at Investors.com.)Looking at the raw total sales of six firms representing the medical sector in the IBD 50 through Thursday, and they're the size of kittens compared with Pfizer's lion-like numbers. But what really roars loudly? The size of the year-over-year increases. This is what the top-performing mutual funds, hedge funds, pension plans, banks and university endowments really want to find.The six medical companies include three in the biotech and ethical drug industry groups: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) ($141 million in net sales in 2017); Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) ($302 million in net sales); and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) ($1.62 billion). Orthodontics industry innovator Align Technology (ALGN) ($594 million) and heart pump maker Abiomed (ABMD) ($1.47 billion) help lead IBD's Medical-Products industry group.San Diego-based genetics research equipment leader Illumina (ILMN) has the biggest annual sales in the bunch at $2.75 billion last year. But here again, it's not the quantity alone that matters; it's the level of growth. Illumina has expanded the top line every year since at least 2009, when sales were $666 million. Compounded annual growth since then: a healthy 19%.The consensus quarterly earnings-per-share estimates for the six IBD 50 firms range from a 26% increase (Jazz Pharma) to 249% (Ligand), and the average is 76%. Average return on equity of 24.9% towers over most companies traded on Wall Street. And the average full-year revenue growth forecast for the six? An impressive 30.3%.Always make sure not to chase stocks up in price. Knowing where a growth stock is in its cycle of rising, falling, and rising again is just as critical as knowing you're investing in a true leader in fundamentals.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

33,A,"China stocks Baozun (BZUN) and Momo (MOMO), both IBD Sector Leaders, are holding above a key technical level after finding support. The moves could represent opportunities to add on shares. Baozun stock jumped 4.3% to 57.81 Monday while Momo stock pared most of its gains and rose 0.5% to 46.65.Baozun and Momo are top China stocks in the fast-growing internet segment that each earn an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. That means their shares outperform 98% of stocks in the market based on key fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.China internet stocks were some of the top performers in June. But as stock market indexes came under pressure in the latter part of the month, so did China stocks. But pullbacks aren't necessarily bad, as they can lead to buying opportunities.Baozun stock is looking to close at its highest level in eight sessions, and to retaking the 50-day line Monday after hovering around that level for about two weeks of trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a stock rebounds higher after finding support at the 50-day line, that could be a chance to add shares to a position. With add-on buy points, you want to buy as close to the 50-day line as possible to prevent from buying an extended stock.This represents Baozun's first pullback to the 50-day line, or 10-week line on a weekly chart, since the China stock's earnings fueled a breakout past a 52.43 buy point.The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as good opportunities to add shares to an existing position, as long as the line is above the buy point.But Baozun stock plunged below the 50-day line in above-average turnover on June 27, closing below the buy point. That may have prompted some investors to exit their positions.That's why it's a good idea to take at least partial profits when a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended from a buy point. Baozun reached that level in its third week after the breakout.Meanwhile, Momo is holding above its 50-day line after rebounding from that level Friday. While Momo stock pared all its gains Monday after rising as much as 4.4% early in the session, volume isn't massive. If the stock was falling hard in heavy volume after rising that much, that would be very bearish.The cup-half-full investor would note that Momo battled back to break even after losing as much as 0.9% midway through the session.The chart for Momo stock looks similar to that of Baozun. Shares gapped up, past a buy point, after earnings and then ran up more than 30%. Then it pulled back to the 50-day line. But unlike Baozun, Momo never round-tripped its gains.As this is the first pullback to the 50-day for Momo after a breakout, it could qualify as an add-on opportunity as well.Momo's June-quarter earnings are projected to accelerate from 57% to 77% as revenue growth slows from 64% to 54%. Accelerating earnings growth is bullish. While the top-line growth is seen slowing, a 54% jump still represents strong growth.Meanwhile, Baozun is expected to see earnings growth slow from 29% to 17% on a sequential basis. Revenue growth is estimated to decelerate slightly from 25% to 21%.In addition to looking at stocks with strong technical action, it's important to focus on stocks that have good fundamentals.

43,A,"Ferrari stock has outshined fellow automakers and luxury players alike since its 2015 debut. But Trump tariff threats and slowing earnings growth have tapped the brakes on the Italian sports car company's shares.Along with declines for the major stock market indexes, Ferrari (RACE) is feeling the weight of recent tweets from President Donald Trump, who is threatening a 20% tariff on cars imported from the EU. The latest threat comes after retaliatory tariffs from the EU in response to Trump's implementation of duties on steel and aluminum.Whether or not the Trump tariff threats become a reality, the threat of automakers getting swept up into the trade war drama in a massive way is a risk that some investors may not be willing to take on. But Ferrari's pricing power could mute the potential impact.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd as the Trump tariff threats loom, so does the company's capital markets day in September, where Ferrari has plans to update its five-year road map. The company in January announced its first SUV is due out in late 2019 or 2020. Ferrari also said it will push into the Chinese market.Ferrari is also working on a luxury electric car that could woo high-end consumers away from premium offerings from Tesla (TSLA). Several luxury and sports carmakers are rolling out would-be Tesla killers in the next few years.""While acknowledging the potential for exciting new product unveils and reiteration of ambitious medium term targets to drive the stock toward our bull case, we remain UW (underweight) as we look ahead of an epoch of higher spending, elevated execution risk, and fierce competition,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a May 22 report.A notable concern for a brand like Ferrari, which has a long history of success in Formula One racing, is how to strike the right balance between growth and preserving exclusivity.Ferrari management's existing strategic plan is to increase sports car shipments from 7,694 units in 2015 to 9,000 in 2019.""We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on this plan given plentiful evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,"" said JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in a May 7 research report.Brinkman noted yearlong waits for customers to take deliveries and the recent announcement of a complete sellout for the F12tdf, of which only 799 were made.""There is likely a level of deliveries beyond which expansion would harm exclusivity (and therefore pricing and profits). We do not know precisely where this limit lies, of course, but we believe it is well in excess of the 10,000 per annum amount,"" Brinkman said.But Jonas says the expansion into new markets like China and new segments like SUVs presents ""a challenge to the brand's exclusivity and residual value retention.""Ferrari stock broke out of a flat base with a 141.66 buy point on June 13. After becoming slightly extended from the 5% chase zone, shares began pulling back amid broader stock market selling and the Trump tariff threats.By the end of June, Ferrari had undercut its 50-day moving average and fell as much as 7% below its buy point, triggering a sell signal. Since then however, Ferrari stock has found support at its still-rising 50-day line.Ferrari stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99. That means it outperforms 96% of stocks on metrics like earnings and sales growth, margins, ROE and price performance. That's far better than any other automaker.Revenue likely fell 4% in the June quarter. That would mark the first top-line decline since Ferrari's public spinoff from Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) in October 2015.Analysts expect earnings growth to decelerate. They see 11% EPS growth in the June quarter after Ferrari earnings raced 37% higher in the March quarter. That would be the smallest profit gain in 10 quarters. Ferrari costs have risen due to product portfolio revisions and the launch of new models.While analysts at Banca IMI called the current year ""more challenging"" for Ferrari, optimism remains.""We believe that Ferrari's unique characteristics place the company in a good position to achieve its midterm targets and to deliver an EBITDA margin at the high end of the range (33-38) of luxury players,"" analysts with Banca IMI said in a June 4 research report.Ferrari's successful IPO could spur public offerings from other high-end automakers.""A read-across on the planned IPO of Aston Martin may also heighten investors' appetite for Ferrari,"" Banca IMI said. The analysts said that could inspire a ""re-rating"" of Ferrari's valuation given there would be a competitor to compare financials.Conversely, Morgan Stanley's Jonas isn't convinced that these IPOs would necessarily be a good thing for Ferrari.Jonas argues that ""a potential supply of new ultra-premium car companies to the public equity markets (Aston Martin, McLaren, Lamborghini, etc.) offers greater supply of stock for investors to choose from, potentially diluting Ferrari's exclusive position in the market.""But with the Trump tariff threats, those IPOs may be on hold, at least until market conditions improve.On the positive side, Jonas notes that Ferrari and other luxury brands ""have shown resilience during periods of economic uncertainty."" He added that the luxury car company is ""probably the least cyclical company in our coverage universe.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:U.S. Auto Sales Strong, But This Is Why GM, Ford Stocks Keep FallingThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCan Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?

51,A,"""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""
"
52,A,"— Donald Trump, June 13, 2018""North Korea is upgrading its nuclear research center at a rapid pace, new satellite imagery analysis suggests.""
"
53,A,"— The Wall Street Journal, June 27, 2018As the president prepares, if this time he does prepare, for his second summit, note all that went wrong at the first. If he does as badly in his July 16 meeting with Vladimir Putin in Finland as he did with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, the consequences could be catastrophic.An exceptionally knowledgeable student of North Korea, the American Enterprise Institute's Nicholas Eberstadt, writing in National Review (""Kim Wins in Singapore""), says the one-day meeting was for the United States ""a World Series of unforced errors."" The result was that North Korea ""walked away with a joint communiqué that read almost as if it had been drafted by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) ministry of foreign affairs.""Kim, says Eberstadt, is ""the boss of a state-run crime cartel that a U.N. Commission of Inquiry wants to charge with crimes against humanity."" Au contraire, said America's president, who slathered Kim with praise: Kim, with whom Trump has ""a very special bond"" is a ""talented man"" who ""loves his country,"" which reciprocates with ""a great fervor."" Trump called Kim a ""very worthy negotiator,"" which might actually have made sense if Kim had been forced to negotiate for the concessions that Trump dispensed gratis.North Korea, Eberstadt says, is committed to what he calls its ""racial socialism,"" which motivates Kim's ""central and sacred mission,"" which is ""nonnegotiable"" — the unconditional reunification of the Korean Peninsula. This presupposes extermination of the South Korean state, which requires the policy Kim announced last New Year's Day — to ""mass-produce nuclear warheads and missiles and speed up their deployment."" Eberstadt:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Such a program would not be necessary for regime legitimation, or for international military extortion, or even to ensure the regime's survival: All of those objectives could surely be satisfied with a limited nuclear force. Why then threaten the U.S. homeland?"" America is the guarantor of South Korea's security, and if Washington can be made to blink at a time and place of Pyongyang's choosing, the U.S.-South Korea alliance will end, as will the U.S. security presence there. Hence the delusional nature of Trump's belief: One one-day meeting sufficed to cause the North Korean regime to abandon its raison d'être.In addition to the legitimation supplied to Pyongyang by the pageantry of the summit for which Trump obviously hungered, the official record of the Singapore deliberations reveals no U.S. interest in Pyongyang's atrocious human rights practices (""unparalleled in the modern world,"" Eberstadt says) that raise doubts about the fervor with which North Koreans appreciate Dear Leader's love for them. In return for Trump's promise to halt military-readiness operations, Kim gave nothing — no inventory of his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nothing beyond North Korea's decades-old commitment to ""denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula, an opaque goal that means only that Pyongyang is not clearly committed to anything — beyond a pre-summit promise to decommission a no-longer-useable nuclear test site. The New Year's Day vow has not been disavowed.Singapore was, Eberstadt believes, probably the greatest diplomatic coup for North Korea since 1950, and a milestone on ""the DPRK's road to establishing itself as a permanent nuclear power."" And the sanctions that were the Trump administration's strategy of ""maximum pressure"" will be difficult to maintain now that a ""defanged"" — Eberstadt's description — Trump has declared the nuclear threat banished.The most dangerous moment of the Trump presidency will arrive when he who is constantly gnawed by insecurities and the fear of not seeming what he is not (""strong""), realizes how weak and childish he seems to all who cast a cool eye on Singapore's aftermath. The danger is of him lashing out in wounded vanity. Meanwhile, this innocent abroad is strutting toward a meeting with the cold-eyed Russian who is continuing to dismantle Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine. He is likely looking ahead to ratcheting up pressure on one of three small nations, Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia, each a member of the NATO alliance that, for the first time in its 69 years, is dealing with a U.S. president who evinces no admiration for what it has accomplished, or any understanding of its revived importance as the hard man in Moscow, who can sniff softness, relishes what Singapore revealed.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

55,A,"Chipmakers are closing out the seventh week of a rally begun in the first week of May, and they've helped power the Nasdaq to its new highs. The gains have been broad, although some were left behind (Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Tower Semiconductors (TSEM)). Others, like Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), remain deep in long-term corrections.Qorvo (QRVO) broke out on Thursday, but remained below long-term resistance near 86. Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics (STM) cleared a buy point in what was maybe not quite a breakout, but significant because it snapped resistance that had capped STM's progress since November.Multiple attempts to break that resistance made STM's base a bit of a puzzle. Possible buy points occurred at 25.40, 25.22 and, finally, a cup-with-handle buy point at 24.62.STM cleared the 24.62 entry June 5, right after it announced its chips were being used in the Alcatel 3V smartphone, just introduced on the European market by China's TCL Communication.STM is a broad-range chipmaker that counts Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), China's Huawei and Western Digital (WDC) among its more than 1,000 customers.The stock's 4.4% gain on June 4 rode volume that was 51% above its 50-day average, well above the 40% minimum needed to qualify as a breakout.But investors may have been hesitant. The breakout move left shares far below the stock's commanding resistance. And STM had posted gap-up moves past buy points on Jan. 18 and March 21. Both rose only briefly above 25.On June 6, STM took out the 25.22 buy point. Volume was only 27% above average. But the stock had pressed to a new high. After a four-day consolidation, shares broke decisively above both the buy point and the 25 resistance level.

60,A,"ETF providers hope to have cracked regulators' code for creating the first exchange traded product backed by Bitcoin — but it's going to cost you.Van Eck Associates and SolidX Partners on June 6 filed a request to list a Bitcoin-linked ETP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will be physically backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.The SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators' concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel Gallancy.""Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,"" Gallancy said in a phone interview. ""We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.""While I'm still skeptical a Bitcoin ETP gets approved in any form this year, you gotta be in it to win it, and this extra hustle from VanEck could pay off down the road,"" said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst.SolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.VanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.If approved, the product will be priced at 25 Bitcoins per share, which equals about $188,000 at June 6 prices, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This compares with a double-digit share price for most ETFs. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.The firms haven't determined fees for the fund yet, but Gallancy said it will probably be on the more expensive side compared with other ETFs, as they'll be handling the additional risk and hassle of trading cryptocurrency.SolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept offline. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn't disclose.VanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm's head, Jan van Eck.

61,A,"AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and other internet service providers once again face the possibility that California will impose its own net neutrality rules, bucking federal regulators and possibly cutting into their business.California lawmakers on Thursday said they forged a deal on a new version of a net neutrality bill. The reworked bill would create the toughest rules in the U.S., state lawmakers said. California's bill prevents ISPs from exempting some services from customer data caps. It also bans ISPs from charging websites ""access fees"" to reach customers.California's State Assembly derailed a similar bill in June. State Sen. Scott Weiner, D-San Francisco, on Thursday said the latest version of the bill restores key consumer protections.Despite the news, AT&T stock inched up 0.3% to close at 32.68 on the stock market today.

62,A,"SAN FRANCISCO — A top SEC official said Thursday that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities, adding that a key point in deciding whether a coin is a security is whether a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized.XNot being securities means transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't subject to SEC rules.""(When) purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security,"" said William Hinman, the head of the SEC's division of corporate finance, at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.However this also means that initial coin offerings, which have in the past been launched by centralized teams, could fall under SEC rules.This is because initial investors could be buying coins in the belief they can profit when they go public and increase in value. In addition, at such an early stage they are not sufficiently decentralized.Bitcoin, which has been falling in recent days, was up 5.5% at $6,645.48 late Thursday, according to Coindesk. Ethereum jumped 9.1% to $519.51. Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) rose 3.9% on the stock market today, Overstock.com (OSTK) gained 3.3%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) added 2.5%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 9.25%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe SEC had indicated in the past that Bitcoin was not a security, but this was the first time an official has said the same about Ethereum, whose status was in question after it was launched by a core group of creators.""Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,"" Hinman said.He also said applying the disclosure regime of federal securities laws to current transactions in Ethereum ""would seem to add little value.""Meanwhile, TruStory founder and CEO Preethi Kasireddy, whose young company uses tokens to incentivize users to uncover ICO scams, thinks the SEC has made the correct decision.However, she said there will be more trouble in the future, as she believes the SEC will have a ""hard time figuring out what's a security and what's not.""And she predicted cryptocurrency prices have much further to fall, and the drops so far this year are ""minor"" compared to what is to come.""I thought correction would be a lot more,"" she said. ""I think there'll be an even bigger correction.""Legal experts at the event welcomed the SEC's clarification. Grant Fondo, who chairs the digital currency and blockchain practice at the Goodwin Procter law firm, said it will help him structure potential token sales.He also believes more clarification will help America become more competitive in the cryptocurrency space.""I do think now more token sales (will) stay in the United States,"" he said. But ""it's a long way to see how it plays out. In the last six months there has been a big push offshore; hopefully this will help people come home.""However, it still remains an open question whether cryptocurrencies are actually good investments.Venture capital giant Keith Rabois, who is known for startup investments and his executive roles at the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn, said there are ""no clear use cases at the moment.""The Kholsa Ventures managing director also said it is difficult to pick the best digital currency just now, when it is still unknown which has either a clear use or the best underlying technology.He added that it has been clear for a ""very long time"" that large swathes of ICOs have been violating U.S. securities laws.But Baiju Bhatt, co-CEO of the Robinhood investment app, said he believes that in the future cryptocurrencies will be an ""awesome store of value,"" though he said it is too early to pick a winner.""Don't believe the hype, pay attention to the details.

63,A,"This past Tuesday, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a groundbreaking decision in NIFLA v. Becerra, a case about California's attempt to regulate so-called ""crisis-pregnancy centers"" — religiously affiliated centers that exist to dissuade women from having abortions. Because the case implicates abortion, much of the coverage of that ruling focused on which side came out ahead on America's most contentious political issue.But that blinkered view of the Court's decision is a mistake, because the Court's decision is one of the most important free-speech rulings in a generation, with implications that extend far beyond the abortion debate.Unlike most cases related to abortion — which concern who may get an abortion and under what circumstances — the NIFLA case concerned government efforts to regulate speech about abortion. The plaintiffs in the case are a group of crisis pregnancy centers. As a matter of moral conviction, these centers do not talk to their clients about abortion.But in 2015, at the urging of pro-choice groups who believed these centers were affirmatively misleading their clients, California enacted a law that required them to provide to all of their clients certain information, including information about how to obtain a taxpayer-subsidized abortion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLaws that regulate what people must say when they speak to others might seem like they would obviously implicate the First Amendment. But, remarkably, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the First Amendment did not apply at all.The reason? The people who worked at the centers, ruled the court, were ""professionals"" and so they could be ordered to speak, or prohibited from speaking, in whatever way the government saw fit.The Ninth Circuit was not the first court to come up with this idea. Several federal courts — though never the Supreme Court — had held that ""professional speech"" could be more easily regulated than ordinary speech. But few of these courts seem to have considered the profound implications of their rulings.Freed from the constraints of the First Amendment, government officials eagerly seized on the so-called ""professional speech doctrine"" to squelch all manner of speech.States cracked down on veterinarians who wanted to email people about their pets, on tour guides who wanted to tell ghost stories, and even on people who just want to publicly criticize government policy on things like traffic-light timing. These are not hypothetical examples: These are real people we have represented.Take the case of John Rosemond. John is a licensed psychologist practicing in North Carolina, and he is also the author of a long-running syndicated column where he often answers reader questions about parenting advice. Sounds normal enough — except to the Kentucky Board of Psychology, which sent John a cease-and-desist letter claiming that his column (which ran in at least one Kentucky paper) constituted the unlicensed practice of psychology in Kentucky.When asked to explain why the state had the power to prohibit a newspaper column, Kentucky's lawyers reached for the obvious tool: John was acting as a ""professional,"" and so the usual First Amendment rules simply did not apply to his speech. We represented John as well and won his case — though only after nearly a year of costly litigation.In short, the ""professional speech"" doctrine posed a real threat to the free-speech rights of millions of ordinary Americans. But even so, it seemed to be only growing in its influence in American courts.That is why Tuesday's opinion is so important: Writing for the majority, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas squarely rejected the idea that states can strip people of their First Amendment rights just by labeling them ""professionals.""""States cannot choose the protection that speech receives under the First Amendment,"" Justice Thomas wrote, as that would give them a powerful tool to impose ""invidious discrimination of disfavored subjects.""Just so: Countless Americans earn their living by speaking or giving advice, whether they are doctors or lawyers, life coaches or comedians. None of them should have to give up their First Amendment rights as a condition of doing their job.Whatever one thinks about crisis pregnancy centers, restrictions on their speech have to be justified under the First Amendment — not just blindly ratified in the name of ""professional regulation.""And while Tuesday's decision protects their speech, it also restored free-speech protections to countless Americans who had been without it for far too long. No matter where you stand on abortion, that is something that all of us should be able to celebrate.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

65,A,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts once wrote that the ""way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" He wrote those words in a 2007 opinion that turned back Seattle's race-based efforts to implement affirmative action-type policies to its local school district. While that case garnered a race-neutral result, his broader message seems to have fallen on deaf ears.In America, race-based policies are expanding not contracting.Rather than reaching down to lower-level schools, affirmative action policies are now exponentially expanding into corporate America.In recent weeks, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) have announced updated diversity policies for selecting new directors. Rather than simply selecting the best candidate, each company will interview a female and an under-represented minority for each open board spot. These policies resemble the National Football League's so-called Rooney Rule which requires that each team interview a minority candidate for open coaching slots.Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet were founded by, and still run by, white men. They have created tremendous wealth and many millions of jobs for women and men of all races and ethnicities. But in light of its new procedure, it's fair to ask: would Amazon reject Jeff Bezos from its board because he's a white male? That would be a disaster for Amazon's investors.It's also fair to ask if the race-hustlers and far-left unions that are pushing these racial and gender diversity initiatives care about corporate profits or return on investment. Liberal policies that their ilk promote, such as high taxation and regulation, diminish corporate profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlphabet announced its new procedure at its annual shareholder meeting a week after Facebook and Amazon did the same. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg proudly publicized its new policy after a question from Jesse Jackson in which he attacked the company because its ""top 15 employees are white."" Jackson lauded Sandberg's proclamation in which she also revealed that Facebook formulated the new board principles in conjunction with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Likewise, Amazon's announcement came in response to an SEIU shareholder proposal pushing board diversity. Jackson was also in attendance to laud that racial initiative. Amazon has since claimed that it's not a new policy but just an affirmation of its practices already in place.There is reason to doubt Amazon's veracity.Companies may ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to exclude any shareholder proposal from their proxy statement. One of the easiest ways to do so is to show that the company already has practices in place that align with the proposal's request. If Amazon is telling the truth now, why didn't it make this basic appeal to the SEC?Amazon certainly avails itself of this option. In 2018, it petitioned the SEC for the right to remove nine proposals from its proxy statement — far more than most corporations do in a given year. Many of these requests involved more complex SEC provisions and legal reasoning than would have been needed to dispatch the SEIU's proposal, that is, if Amazon is telling the truth.What is true is that once the SEIU's proposal was on Amazon's proxy statement, it received support from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).ISS is one of only two major proxy advisory services. Operating with almost zero scrutiny, these firms increasingly exert outsized influence on environmental, governmental, and social issues. That's because, according to research from the American Council for Capital Formation, ""when proxy advisors recommend voting in favor of a proposal, large institutional holders support the resolution 80% of the time. And some funds automatically vote with the proxy advisors nearly 100% of the time.""ISS has become little more than a rubber stamp for liberal activist investors. From climate change to gender pay issues, to board racial and gender composition, ISS supports a full slate of far-left shareholder proposals.It's entirely possible that Amazon caved to the SEIU's proposal under pressure from ISS. If ISS can exert that much power over Bezos and Amazon — the richest person in the world and one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies — what choice do other companies have but to bend to ISS's liberal will?The outsized role of proxy advisors has received congressional attention. A bipartisan bill working its way through the House, co-sponsored by Congressmen Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., seeks to curb these firms' unchecked power.There are also non-governmental remedies.First, companies need to steel their collective spines and speak up. If ISS supports a shareholder proposal, the vote is essentially rigged. ISS clients often ""rubber stamp"" votes for its recommendations without any deliberative process. Since shareholder resolutions are non-binding, and these votes are all-but rigged, companies should give them little deference.Second, fund managers must take a more active role in evaluating ISS recommendations.Finally, the conservative investment community should work toward creating a proxy advisory service that reflects pro-growth and long-term return on investment metrics.Otherwise, conservatives may as well cede this entire space to liberal firms and watch corporate America drift further to the left. This year, with ISS backing, it's the Rooney Rule run amok. Next year, it may be something even more insidious.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsThanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.

Today, the firm is working on SkinTE, a rival to traditional skin-graft technology.Investor's Business Daily interviewed Chief Executive Denver Lough in May. An IBD article on June 18 focused on the technology, which removes an entire ""village"" of supportive cellular elements to regrow full-thickness skin for burn victims and to lessen the visibility of scars.For the article, IBD asked to interview an expert familiar with the technology. A spokesperson for the company connected IBD with Dr. Mark Granick, a professor and chief of plastic surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.Both the company and Granick failed to disclose that Granick is a paid member of PolarityTE's clinical board of advisors. That fact is listed on PolarityTE's website, but isn't listed on Granick's public profile with the medical school.A spokesperson for the company told IBD in a follow-up email that advisory boards are normal for biotech and medtech companies.""These are small companies that seek input from those in research of clinical practice,"" the spokesperson said. ""I know that we didn't present Granick as someone other than (one) of the first users of the product who can talk about his experiences.""The article has since been removed from IBD's Investors.com website.Citron describes itself as a stock commentary website. It has previously published negative reports on fellow med-tied firms Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG), as well as bigger tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).The website cautions it usually has a short position in the securities it profiles. Citron didn't immediately return a request asking what position it has in PolarityTE.This story updates and replaces a June 25 article on Citron Research and PolarityTE.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFs

68,A,"What's the No. 1 skill employees are lacking? Effective communication, according to a recent LinkedIn survey.""The ancient art of persuasion is no longer a soft skill. It's your competitive edge in the age of automation and artificial intelligence,"" said Carmine Gallo, author of ""Five Stars: The Communication Secrets to Get from Good to Great."" Gallo is also president of Gallo Communications Group, a keynote speaker and Harvard instructor.Tips on reaching people:Keep it basic. Great persuaders use simple words to explain complex ideas, Gallo says.He points to co-founders of a fast-growing startup in the health insurance space, who Gallo interviewed for his book. ""They decided to write all of their material using third-grade words. Most of your customers don't understand your subject as well as you do. Use simple words to sell your ideas.""Spin yarns. Humans are hard-wired for storytelling, Gallo says. ""Stories inform, educate and inspire,"" he said. ""Stories are the single best tool we have to transport our ideas to another person.""Richard Branson, the billionaire Virgin-brand founder, told Gallo that storytelling can be used to drive change. Do that with your customers and within your organization by ""seeing yourself as the chief storytelling officer for your brand or department,"" Gallo said.Great storytellers have an unfair advantage. But you can learn to tell good stories.Tell personal stories of overcoming hurdles. Share customer case studies. Inform about your company's history. Storytelling is ""an unfair advantage that you can use to stand out in a sea of average,"" Gallo said.Refresh presentations. Stick to a 10-minute rule, Gallo says. Studies show that most people tune out of a lecture or presentation after 10 minutes.""After the 10-minute mark, you must re-engage your audience with stories, videos or demonstrations to maintain their interest,"" Gallo said. ""Above all, make sure you hit the most important points in the first 10 minutes.""Be genuine. Honesty is always the best policy, because people will know where they stand. And they will have been provided a direction to improve.That's from Sandy Brown, commissioner of Major League Lacrosse, the premier professional outdoor lacrosse league.Acknowledge people. Offer a pat on the back for a job well done. ""A little encouragement goes a long way,"" Brown said.Be polite. No matter the subject matter of an email, always end with ""many thanks,"" Brown said. Extend an olive branch even in the most difficult emails. And ""for those emails that are even the most mundane, it shows that you care,"" Brown added.It's also his policy to return emails within 24 hours, or better yet within the same day. ""This says a lot about your dependability,"" he said.Be present. FaceTime is a useful tool. But actual interaction is still crucial.""Moreover, these opportunities do not always happen organically — sometimes you have to create the chance to get in the same room with your important constituents,"" said Scott Ferguson, CEO of World Trade Centers Association, a trade group.Take initiative. Check in with employees across the organization. ""Empathize with their concerns and jointly problem solve,"" said Tim Chen, CEO of NerdWallet, a personal finance website and app.""Not only does this approach help leaders recognize the root cause of organizational issues, it also makes employees part of the resolution process,"" he said.Master metaphors. Business magnate and investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) can hardly get through an interview without using them and analogies to explain his investing decisions, Gallo points out.""The human brain thinks in analogy,"" Gallo continued. ""We process our world by comparing something new to something we've seen before. A great persuader understands this and will use metaphors and analogies to make the abstract understandable.""

American pastor Andrew Brunson is being held on charges that he aided terrorist groups in Turkey.S&P 500 component Lockheed Martin slipped 2.3% on the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney division makes the F-35's engines, was off 1.9%. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major F-35 subcontractor and prime contractor on the upcoming B-21 stealth bomber, fell 2.7%. Aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which is developing a future fighter along with Lockheed, tumbled 3.8% amid U.S.-China trade tensions.The Senate voted 85-10 in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes $639 billion in military spending.

The NATO ally's use of Russia's S-400 system in particular raises concerns.Turkey actually helps build the F-35, which also worries Congress.

The country remains under a state of emergency.Turkey has agreed to buy Russia's formidable S-400 air-defense system for $2.5 billion, amid ongoing tensions with fellow NATO members.Russia's S-400 system, deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a major threat to ""fourth generation"" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.Back in May, Russia tested a new surface-to-air missile that it claims could destroy even these stealth aircraft. The new S-500 is also supposedly able to intercept hypersonic missiles, drones and other aircraft. It also is said to be capable of destroying objects in near-space, some 62 miles above the face of the Earth.If Russia's claims are accurate, the S-500 would offset a major advantage in U.S. warfighting capacity.The F-35 program, the most expensive military program ever at $400 billion, has faced criticism over cost overruns and combat effectiveness.The stealth fighter only recently flew its first-ever combat missions as part of an Israeli air force operation.

86,A,"Value stocks were supposed to have a stellar year. Instead they're bleeding assets, which could portend dangerous times ahead for the stock market.An index tracking a market-neutral value strategy, which picks shares that are cheap relative to the underlying company's assets, is trading at its lowest level since 2013 and is on pace for a third consecutive month of declines. A couple of value-focused exchange-traded funds absorbed big block sales on Tuesday, boosting trading volumes for the ETFs.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) absorbed $424 million in trades Tuesday, almost triple its average daily volume over the past year.

89,A,"When Occidental Petroleum (OXY) packed up its Los Angeles, Calif., headquarters and shipped out to Houston in 2014, few investors had heard of the Permian Basin. At the time, Occidental was the largest oil producer in Texas. It was the largest producer of natural gas in California.By 2017, the almost century-old company was the third-largest oil play in Texas. That put it just behind EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). It is also among the largest holders of acreage and producers of oil in the Permian Basin. That is the west Texas redoubt that Bloomberg has said is on track to ""become the world's largest oil patch over the next decade.""Occidental shares slipped 2.4% in weak trade Monday, edging just below the stock's 50-day moving average. The move technically put the stock back into a buy range above a 78.18 buy point in a cup base. Investors probably don't want to enter a stock that high in the buy range. But a rebound off the 50-day line could produce a follow-on buying opportunity.Many Permian producers face a musical chairs-type shake out, as production outpaces the available capacity of pipelines to transport the oil to market. But Occidental owns its own gathering systems within the basin, the pipelines that take oil and gas from the wellhead to larger pipelines or to separation facilities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, Occidental has locked down contracts giving them capacity of 470,000 barrels per day out of the Permian, according to a CNBC interview with chief executive Vicki Hollub in May. At that time, that was roughly double the company's output within the basin, she said.In mid-June, capacity bottlenecks trimmed prices for oil coming out of the Permian to about $10 below West Texas Intermediate crude priced at Cushing, Okla., the transaction location for the WTI benchmark. The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""In addition, Occidental is expanding the loading capacity of its Ingleside oil export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. It is adding loading arms and dredging the terminal to a depth of 66 feet, allowing it to load VLCC tankers — the largest class of oil tanker afloat — with oil headed for markets in Europe and Asia. Crude exports out of Corpus Christi are expected to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2020.In 2013, just before its move to Texas, Occidental began exiting locations in the Bakken shale of Montana and North Dakota. It spun off its operations in California, and divested four international operations. As a result, production decreased 40% — just as the global oil glut was swinging into gear. Earnings per share dropped by 98%, to 12 cents, in 2015, followed by a $1-per-share loss the following year.Earnings recovered to 89 cents per share last year. They are projected to rebound to $4.61 for 2018, with a 673% jump projected by the consensus estimate for the second quarter.Occidental operates in three segments: oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing. In 2017, the oil and gas unit produced about 63% of revenue. Chemicals were another 35%. The oil unit generated 55% of total earnings. Chemicals were 41%.The strength of diversification was apparent in the segment numbers. For 2017, Occidental's operations outside the U.S. accounted for more than 100% of profit, because domestic operations and oil exploration efforts both lost money.An increasing number of analysts are questioning how much longer the Permian basin can continue to increase its total output, and at what point the Permian's localized glut might began to spread.Hollub said she expects additional pipeline capacity will be built, easing the take-away restrictions. More crucial, she told CNBC, are labor shortages plaguing the industry.She said companies attempting to ramp activity much above current levels are in for a struggle, and face rising costs.""We're really at the activity level we want to be,"" she said, pointing to Occidental's current output from the field. ""If you are a company that is not trying to ramp up significantly, you have a significant advantage.""Occidental has delivered uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1975, with annual increases each year since 2002. The current annual rate is $3.08 per share, which yields about 3.7% on an annualized basis.RELATED: Dow Giant Triggers Sell Signal As China Trade War Boosts RivalIBD Stock Of The Day: This China Internet Gives Back All Its GainsPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70Divergence In The Stock Market Is A Worrisome Sign

Those were the Leisure-Movies & Related group, Internet-Content and enterprise software developers.The movies group easily outran all others. It rose 5.2%, vs. the internet content group's 4.3% gain and a 4% advance for the enterprise software developers.Netflix (NFLX) is clearly the big dog in the movies group. It posted a 4.9% gain over the five-day period.

92,A,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts once wrote that the ""way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" He wrote those words in a 2007 opinion that turned back Seattle's race-based efforts to implement affirmative action-type policies to its local school district. While that case garnered a race-neutral result, his broader message seems to have fallen on deaf ears.In America, race-based policies are expanding not contracting.Rather than reaching down to lower-level schools, affirmative action policies are now exponentially expanding into corporate America.In recent weeks, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) have announced updated diversity policies for selecting new directors. Rather than simply selecting the best candidate, each company will interview a female and an under-represented minority for each open board spot. These policies resemble the National Football League's so-called Rooney Rule which requires that each team interview a minority candidate for open coaching slots.Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet were founded by, and still run by, white men. They have created tremendous wealth and many millions of jobs for women and men of all races and ethnicities. But in light of its new procedure, it's fair to ask: would Amazon reject Jeff Bezos from its board because he's a white male? That would be a disaster for Amazon's investors.It's also fair to ask if the race-hustlers and far-left unions that are pushing these racial and gender diversity initiatives care about corporate profits or return on investment. Liberal policies that their ilk promote, such as high taxation and regulation, diminish corporate profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlphabet announced its new procedure at its annual shareholder meeting a week after Facebook and Amazon did the same. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg proudly publicized its new policy after a question from Jesse Jackson in which he attacked the company because its ""top 15 employees are white."" Jackson lauded Sandberg's proclamation in which she also revealed that Facebook formulated the new board principles in conjunction with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Likewise, Amazon's announcement came in response to an SEIU shareholder proposal pushing board diversity. Jackson was also in attendance to laud that racial initiative. Amazon has since claimed that it's not a new policy but just an affirmation of its practices already in place.There is reason to doubt Amazon's veracity.Companies may ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to exclude any shareholder proposal from their proxy statement. One of the easiest ways to do so is to show that the company already has practices in place that align with the proposal's request. If Amazon is telling the truth now, why didn't it make this basic appeal to the SEC?Amazon certainly avails itself of this option. In 2018, it petitioned the SEC for the right to remove nine proposals from its proxy statement — far more than most corporations do in a given year. Many of these requests involved more complex SEC provisions and legal reasoning than would have been needed to dispatch the SEIU's proposal, that is, if Amazon is telling the truth.What is true is that once the SEIU's proposal was on Amazon's proxy statement, it received support from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).ISS is one of only two major proxy advisory services. Operating with almost zero scrutiny, these firms increasingly exert outsized influence on environmental, governmental, and social issues. That's because, according to research from the American Council for Capital Formation, ""when proxy advisors recommend voting in favor of a proposal, large institutional holders support the resolution 80% of the time. And some funds automatically vote with the proxy advisors nearly 100% of the time.""ISS has become little more than a rubber stamp for liberal activist investors. From climate change to gender pay issues, to board racial and gender composition, ISS supports a full slate of far-left shareholder proposals.It's entirely possible that Amazon caved to the SEIU's proposal under pressure from ISS. If ISS can exert that much power over Bezos and Amazon — the richest person in the world and one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies — what choice do other companies have but to bend to ISS's liberal will?The outsized role of proxy advisors has received congressional attention. A bipartisan bill working its way through the House, co-sponsored by Congressmen Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., seeks to curb these firms' unchecked power.There are also non-governmental remedies.First, companies need to steel their collective spines and speak up. If ISS supports a shareholder proposal, the vote is essentially rigged. ISS clients often ""rubber stamp"" votes for its recommendations without any deliberative process. Since shareholder resolutions are non-binding, and these votes are all-but rigged, companies should give them little deference.Second, fund managers must take a more active role in evaluating ISS recommendations.Finally, the conservative investment community should work toward creating a proxy advisory service that reflects pro-growth and long-term return on investment metrics.Otherwise, conservatives may as well cede this entire space to liberal firms and watch corporate America drift further to the left. This year, with ISS backing, it's the Rooney Rule run amok. Next year, it may be something even more insidious.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsThanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.

Broadly, biotech stocks rose about 1.5%.Galapagos tested its drug, GLPG2737, as a cystic fibrosis treatment for patients with a specific genetic mutation. The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance. It also trailed Vertex's data for its drugs VX-659 and VX-445, which showed benefits of 10%-11% and 12%-14%, respectively.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""With Vertex already advancing into Phase 3 pivotal studies with their triple regimens, we see few competitors that will be able to challenge Vertex in the near/intermediate term.""Chico kept her outperform rating on the biotech company's stock.An improvement of 10% vs. the placebo would have been competitive, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a report. GLPG2737 is also being tested as part of a triple-regimen containing a pair of other drugs from Galapagos. But Divan is now bearish on that study, called Falcon.Thursday's ""data raises significant concerns about Falcon and the competitiveness of the entire (cystic fibrosis) franchise,"" he said.Galapagos is partnered with AbbVie on its cystic fibrosis efforts. But AbbVie is ""taking a knee in"" cystic fibrosis, Raymond James' Chico noted. In a press release, Galapagos said AbbVie decided not to proceed with a previously contemplated second triple-regimen therapy.Now, ""Galapagos is reviewing the future of its CF (cystic fibrosis) collaboration with AbbVie,"" the biotech company said in its release.The data release from Galapagos removes a major overhang on Vertex stock, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. He expects Vertex to be ""the dominant (cystic fibrosis) player for the foreseeable future.""Abrahams expects the biotech company to hit out-year cystic fibrosis treatment sales of about $7.5 billion and $15 per share in earnings. He has a 202 price target on Vertex stock.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges has a 175 price target on Vertex. He noted Galapagos' cystic fibrosis treatment resulted in a sweat chloride reduction that was also materially lower than Vertex's results in its experimental triple-regimens. Sweat chloride is an indicator of cystic fibrosis.""None of this is particularly surprising to us,"" he said in a report.

94,A,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) grabbed a bullish analyst view on Monday, nearly a week after it unveiled ""landmark"" data for a gene therapy to treat boys with a muscle-wasting disease.JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko assigned a 275 price target to Sarepta stock — nearly double the shares' value today. At the close on the stock market today, Sarepta dipped 1.9%, to 137.74, amid similarly bullish views that sent rival Solid Biosciences (SLDB) up 2.6%, to 43.15.Sarepta's gene therapy, called micro-dystrophin, is under investigation as a Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment. Sarepta has an approved drug for the same use called Exondys 51. It works by exon skipping, a form of RNA splicing that skips over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code.If approved, micro-dystrophin could chip away at sales of Exondys 51 and other exon-skipping drugs in Sarepta's pipeline, Bayko said. But gene therapy is also potentially curative, meaning Sarepta and others in the same position are eyeing high prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Management indicated the price for AveXis' (now Novartis' (NVS)) gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy at $2 million is too low, so we bookmark it between $2 million and $8 million which represents the net present value of 15 years' worth of exon skipping,"" Bayko said in a report to clients.Sarepta assumes it could grab approval for an exon-skipping drug called golodirsen by year's end. It also sees approval for a similar drug called casimersen roughly nine months later. The biotech company notes that it's likely micro-dystrophin will cannibalize some of those sales.The ongoing test assumes micro-dystrophin can work as a Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment for 70% of patients, Bayko said. That statistic is based on the specific parts of the genetic code that need to be skipped.Micro-dystrophin is created using what's called an adeno-associated virus. The virus doesn't cause disease, but prompts a very mild immune response. About 15% of patients couldn't enroll in the ongoing test due to antibodies in their blood that would make them immune to the drug.But Sarepta is looking at strategies to overcome pre-existing antibodies. The ongoing study is in patients ages 4-7, but Sarepta also has plans to test micro-dystrophin in younger and older children. Further, exon-skipping drugs could still have a role to play.The biotech company has some preclinical evidence showing there could be a benefit of using exon-skipping drugs prior to gene therapy. The biotech company also sees exon-skipping drugs as monthly maintenance therapy following gene therapy.""Either of these strategies would support substantial upside to our base case, where we assume the gene therapy cannibalizes revenues from the exon skippers,"" she said.The biotech company will likely accelerate enrollment in its next study, which will dose 24 more children in what's called ""Cohort C."" These patients will be tested for functional improvements at the year mark, Bayko said.The Food and Drug Administration may allow Sarepta to use the Cohort C study as the basis for approval. Sarepta will soon meet with the FDA to determine how to structure the study and its key goals.Those goals might be tailored to the gene therapy. The root cause of muscular dystrophy is a lack of dystrophin, a protein tied to muscle function. Sarepta will likely look for the OK to use increased micro-dystrophin as a measure of success in the study.The biotech company could also boost sales by using gene therapy as a treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Bayko doesn't currently include that use for the gene therapy in her model for Sarepta.But ""Sarepta could mitigate the expected drop and plateau in gene therapy sales, in part by the staggered introduction of (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy) gene therapies which have significant overlap with the micro-dystrophin construct,"" she said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

96,A,"Governance: Conservatives are celebrating a number of important victories at the Supreme Court, as well as the chance to replace moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy. But none of these wins would have been possible if the Never-Trump crowd had its way. How about a mea culpa?Over the past few days, the Court ruled against forced union dues that fatten public sector unions and provide a gravy train of campaign cash to Democrats. It ruled that President Trump's restrictions on travel from terror-prone countries was constitutional. The court upheld Ohio's right to clean up its voter registration rolls. It said that states can't force pro-life organizations to advertise abortion services.All were landmark decisions that upheld core conservative principles. And each came down to a 5-4 vote, with Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch casting the deciding vote.In fact, of the 13 cases decided by a 5-4 margin this term, Gorsuch himself wrote five of the opinions.Liberals currently freaking out about these cases understand the importance of Gorsuch's appointment, as well as Trump's role in getting him there.Recall that when Justice Scalia died suddenly in 2016, President Obama named liberal Judge Merrick Garland as his replacement. Senate Republicans blocked Garland from getting a hearing, arguing that voters should have the chance to weigh in when they voted in the presidential elections.So, everyone knew the stakes in the November election. A vote for Hillary Clinton meant a liberal majority on the court. A vote for Trump at least provided the hope that conservatives would retain their tentative majority.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet despite the importance of replacing Scalia with another conservative, the Never-Trump crowd refused to support his presidential campaign. The list, by the way, is surprisingly long (Wikipedia has an entire page devoted to it) and includes hundreds of governors, senators, congressmen, state and local officials, and conservative pundits. Many of them outright backed Hillary Clinton.What's more, just after the court ended its session, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his plans to retire. That means Trump can replace moderate Kennedy with a more reliably conservative justice. Before his first term is up, Trump may also be able to replace the ailing liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In other words, Trump has the chance to decisively shift the balance of the court — something most Never-Trump Republicans have been dreaming about for decades.We admit that we, too, had our doubts about Trump during the primaries. Our concern was that, given his past positions and writings, Trump was one of the least reliably conservative candidates among the huge field of contenders.Once he won the nomination, however, it became clear that, for all his faults, he'd be far preferable to Hillary Clinton.Then, to our surprise — and many on the right — Trump went on to achieve more for conservatives in just over a year than President Reagan did in his first term, or George W. Bush in eight years.Trump secured huge pro-growth tax cuts, embarked on an aggressive regulatory rollback, neutered the out-of-control EPA, achieved a swift victory over ISIS, named a huge number of conservative judges, tried to gain some measure of control over the country's borders, chipped away at ObamaCare, and partially rolled back the disastrous Dodd-Frank act.He's been unwavering in his willingness to stand up to partisan hacks in the media — another huge win for conservatives. And, free trade aside, Trump continues to aggressively push a free-market conservative agenda against increasingly fierce and violent liberal attacks.Despite all this, legions of Never-Trumpers still wish he weren't in office. George Will even penned a column last week urging Republicans to hand control of Congress over to Democrats, to ""protect"" the country until Trump is out of office.This is madness.

Do that with your customers and within your organization by ""seeing yourself as the chief storytelling officer for your brand or department,"" Gallo said.Great storytellers have an unfair advantage. But you can learn to tell good stories.Tell personal stories of overcoming hurdles. Share customer case studies. Inform about your company's history. Storytelling is ""an unfair advantage that you can use to stand out in a sea of average,"" Gallo said.Refresh presentations. Stick to a 10-minute rule, Gallo says. Studies show that most people tune out of a lecture or presentation after 10 minutes.""After the 10-minute mark, you must re-engage your audience with stories, videos or demonstrations to maintain their interest,"" Gallo said. ""Above all, make sure you hit the most important points in the first 10 minutes.""Be genuine. Honesty is always the best policy, because people will know where they stand. And they will have been provided a direction to improve.That's from Sandy Brown, commissioner of Major League Lacrosse, the premier professional outdoor lacrosse league.Acknowledge people. Offer a pat on the back for a job well done. ""A little encouragement goes a long way,"" Brown said.Be polite. No matter the subject matter of an email, always end with ""many thanks,"" Brown said.

109,A,"— From ""Getting On,"" by Alan BennettThis, one of the pleasures of being a conservative, is not for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28. She recently won the Democratic nomination — effectively, election — in a Bronx and Queens congressional district, running as a ""democratic socialist."" In response to her, progressives and conservatives are experiencing different excitements.The left relishes the socialist label as a rejection of squishy centrism — a naughty, daring rejection of timidity: Aux barricades, citoyens! The right enjoys a tingle of delicious fear: We told you that the alternative to us is the dark night of socialism.At the risk of spoiling the fun — the left's anticipation of the sunny uplands of social justice; the right's frisson of foreboding — consider two questions: What is socialism? And what might a socialist American government do?In its 19th-century infancy, socialist theory was at least admirable in its clarity: It meant state ownership of the means of production (including arable land), distribution and exchange. Until, of course, the state ""withers away"" (Friedrich Engels' phrase), when a classless, and hence harmonious, society can dispense with government.After World War II, Britain's Labour Party diluted socialist doctrine to mean state ownership of the economy's ""commanding heights"" (Lenin's phrase from 1922) — heavy industry (e.g., steel), mining, railroads, telecommunications, etc. Since then, in Britain and elsewhere, further dilution has produced socialism as comprehensive economic regulation by the administrative state (obviating the need for nationalization of economic sectors) and government energetically redistributing wealth. So, if America had a socialist government today, what would it be like?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSocialism favors the thorough permeation of economic life by ""social"" (aka political) considerations, so it embraces protectionism — government telling consumers what they can buy, in what quantities and at what prices. (A socialist American government might even set quotas and prices for foreign washing machines.)Socialism favors maximizing government's role supplementing, even largely supplanting, the market — voluntary private transactions — in the allocation of wealth by implementing redistributionist programs. (Today America's sky is dark with dollars flying hither and yon at government's direction: Transfer payments distribute 14% of GDP, two-thirds of the federal budget, up from a little more than one-quarter in 1960. In the half-century 1963-2013, transfer payments were the fastest-growing category of personal income. By 2010, American governments were transferring $2.2 trillion in government money, goods and services.)Socialism favors vigorous government interventions in the allocation of capital, directing it to uses that far-sighted government knows, and the slow-witted market does not realize, constitute the wave of the future. So, an American socialist government might tell, say, Carrier Corp. and Harley-Davidson that the government knows better than they do where they should invest shareholders' assets.Socialism requires — actually, socialism is — industrial policy, whereby government picks winners and losers in conformity with the government's vision of how the future ought to be rationally planned. What could go wrong? (Imagine, weirdly, a president practicing compassionate socialism by ordering his energy secretary to prop up yesterday's coal industry against the market menace of fracking — cheap oil and natural gas.)Socialism, which fancies itself applied social science, requires a bureaucracy of largely autonomous experts unconstrained by a marginalized — ideally, a paralyzed — Congress. So, an American socialist government would rule less by laws than by regulations written in administrative agencies staffed by experts insulated from meddling by elected legislators. (Utah Sen. Mike Lee's office displays two piles of paper. One, a few inches high, contains the laws Congress passed in a recent year. The other, about 8 feet tall, contains regulations churned out that year by the administrative state's agencies.)Socialism favors vast scope for ad hoc executive actions unbound by constraining laws that stifle executive nimbleness and creativity. (Imagine an aggrieved president telling, say, Harley-Davidson: ""I've"" — first-person singular pronoun — ""done so much for you."")Today's American socialists say that our government has become the handmaiden of rapacious factions and entrenched elites, and that there should be much more government. They are half-right. To be fair, they also say that after America gets ""on the right side of history"" (an updated version of after ""the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest""), government will be truly disinterested, manipulated by no rent-seeking factions, serving only justice. That is, government will be altogether different than it is, or ever has been. Seriously.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

He reiterated his buy rating and 27 price target on Cara stock.Another dose of CR845, at 0.5 micrograms per kilogram of weight, failed to significantly reduce pain in post-surgical patients. But it did significantly cut down on nausea and vomiting over a 24-hour period after surgery, Cara said in a news release.Chief Executive Derek Chalmers noted the need to find alternatives to addictive painkillers known as opioids. Researchers have also tied the use of opioids to nausea and vomiting.""There is a critical need for post-surgical analgesics (painkillers), like I.V. CR845, that lack abuse potential and traditional mu-opioid side effects,"" Chalmers said in a written statement.Janney's Trbovich says he wouldn't be surprised to see Cara seek out a partner to help it develop and commercialize intravenous CR845 for post-surgical pain relief. It's possible now that short sellers could give the stock a reprieve.As of May 31, 6.8 million shares of Cara had been sold short, he said. This is down from 9.8 million shares that were short as of June 30, 2017, when Cara reported negative results for oral CR845 in osteoporosis pain. But the current short still represents 25% of the firm's float, he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Next Nvidia?

112,A,"Breakouts don't always work. That doesn't mean the stock is automatically a failure.The failures start when a stock clears a proper buy point, then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the golden sell rule: Get out no deeper than 8% below your purchase price.But then what?Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not. Remember, breakouts tend to work better when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend.W.W. Grainger (GWW), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, has been in an uptrend since July 2009.The base, begun in July 2011, was V-shaped (1) and featured heavy selling on the left side. Poor characteristics.Grainger still managed to form a handle with a 156.95 buy point and broke out in strong trade Sept. 13 (2). The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the buy mark.In the process, it carved through its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But it also found firm support at its 200-day moving average (3).Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner. Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it.A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.In the meantime, keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes that are in the top half of the trading range suggest that institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for the first three days above 200-day support (4). Volume rose on the first and third days, too. Good signs. It retook the buy point Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.Four trading sessions later, Grainger stormed past the 156.95 buy point in the original cup with handle on Oct. 18 with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade (5). It climbed 41% in just five months, giving investors plenty of chances to sell on the way up for an excellent short-term gain.(Editor's Note: A version of this story originally ran in the Jan. 19, 2012, edition of IBD.

113,A,"Sugar stockpiles are poised for a record as slowing demand growth and surging production creates the worst-performing commodity of 2018.Consumers have become increasingly wary of the health impact of their sweet tooth, and companies from canned-fruit maker Del Monte Foods Inc. to snack-food seller Mondelez International Inc. are touting products made with less sugar. While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4% in recent seasons, down from 1.7% over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer. Farmers in Thailand are also collecting massive crops. World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25% in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years. The price is doomed to stay low for a while.""On Monday, raw sugar for October delivery fell 1% to 11.4 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.Investors are setting up for more declines.In the week ended July 3, money managers more than tripled their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, to 54,736 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. The move came as short holdings increased 15%, while long bets fell almost 7%.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, in Brazil surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Of course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's central southern region, the world's biggest-producing locale. The potential for an El Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Conn. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market.""

114,A,"As a theatrical production, last weekend's G-7 had it all: young French knights unhorsed in a joust; Wagnerian heroines sinking into despair; and the King's privy councilors bellowing about betrayal, backstabbing and burning in hell.But there was one thing even more unsettling than all the sturm und drang over the Trump administration's rejection of the G-7 Communiqué: the document itself. Its plot can be summed up in three little words: ""tax and spend.""Yes, the clash over trade policy is deeply concerning. Hopefully the posturing and tariff threats will be of short duration — and the solution to the (thus far mostly theoretical) trade war will not involve any new ""plurilateral"" and ""inclusive"" agreements (to quote the Communiqué).And there was one positive in the Communiqué: language demonstrating solidarity on North Korea, Russia, Syria, and terrorism, as well as talk of unity in the face of threats to world peace by China and Iran. One of the main reasons the G-7 was established was for the mutual security of the Western market democracies.But a careful examination of the rest of the Communiqué — and how it would affect American taxpayers — leads to just one question: Why did it take Trump so long to reject it?Code words embedded in key sections of the Communiqué should set off alarm bells:This chestnut appears in every Communiqué. And civil servants and politicians in every G-7 nation regularly cite them to justify more government spending on the problem. For them, the condition of the environment is always a sign of market failure rather than an opportunity for market-based solutions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Communiqué also doubled down on the Paris Climate Agreement, an ineffective but costly pact from which the U.S. wisely exited last year. The agreement would not have made a dint on global temperatures. However, as my Heritage Foundation colleague Nicolas Loris has noted, it would open the door to ""egregious regulation, cronyism, and government spending that would have been as disastrous for the American economy as it is proving to be for those in Europe.""Who is to decide what is ""fair?' Again the Communiqué tilts away from a free market and toward whatever the state decides constitutes ""fairness.""There's the word ""fair"" again. What does it mean? Well, the Communiqué supports an OECD proposal aimed at centralizing and ""harmonizing"" global tax rules. By harmonizing, they mean raising effective tax rates on international firms to European levels — not lowering them to levels more compatible with economic growth. Naturally, most of the firms affected would be American. Odd, how the G-7 focuses only on collecting more taxes, never on cutting taxes and reducing government spending.Evidence from where? Sustained by whom? Such loaded phrases practically beg for preordained, politically correct answers that leave little room for solutions other than very expensive statist health care.As Jeffrey Smith and Alex Gladstein recently noted in Quartz Africa, Western policies and programs aimed at achieving the UN's SDG goals carefully avoid mention of concepts such as corruption, genuine human rights, and real functioning democracy. The unfortunate, practical result is to bolster the power of authoritarian dictatorships in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. They know that, by merely paying lip service to lofty SDG goals, they will appease any serious efforts to rescue the roughly 4 billion people under their rule.The American people need relief from recklessly expanding federal spending and the leviathan state it supports. Much of the G-7 Communiqué, on the other hand, reads like a blueprint for ever bigger government.President Trump's decision not to endorse it was the right one. Perhaps other G-7 leaders will re-examine its underlying assumptions and present a more prudent and fiscally balanced set of recommendations next year.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

115,A,"It's time to give Sector Leader Salesforce.com (CRM) some credit. While enterprise software leaders like ServiceNow (NOW), Baozun (BZUN), Paycom (PAYC) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) have come under selling pressure of late, Salesforce has shown resilience.It came close to a test of the 10-week moving average but didn't quite touch the line. Still, the stock's recent strength is worth noting.Widely regarded as one of leaders in cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS), Salesforce has one of the most consistent track records of growth out there.Even with a market capitalization of around $100 billion, the company had been able to churn out 25%-plus earnings and sales growth for several quarters in a row. Not many large-cap stocks can say that, but the consistent growth is proof positive that demand remains strong for Salesforce's sales and marketing software.Shares of Salesforce gapped up on May 30 after its latest earnings report. The results showed that enterprise customers continue to move their operations to lower cost, cloud-based services with more scalability.Adjusted earnings per share jumped 69% from a year ago, while sales increased 25% to just over $3 billion. Wall Street also liked the look of bullish guidance for the current quarter.SaaS is the largest segment of the cloud market. According to tech research firm Gartner, sales are expected to rise 22% this year to $73.6 billion. By 2021, Gartner expects SaaS spending to reach 45% of total application software spending by 2021.That means the growth runway still looks good for Salesforce.According to research firm IDC, the company controlled about 20% of the global customer relationship management software market in 2017, up slightly from 18.1% in 2016.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.You Might Also Like:Cloud Computing: Find Top Cloud Stocks And Track Industry Trends

116,A,"The U.S. economy is cruising along so well right now that it might take a stock-market rout to avert a Trump trade war.President Donald Trump touts his economic record on pretty much a daily basis of late and feels like he is launching trade conflicts from a position of strength. Now that verbal bombs aimed at Europe, Canada, Mexico, China and others are being followed by live tariffs and retaliatory action, the prospect for talks have never looked so dim.The trade conflict seems likely to get worse before it gets better. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have largely ruled out trying to wrest control of trade policy back from the White House.The only thing that might stop a trade war in its tracks — before the costs escalate — would be a suddenly lousy stock market that begins to put Trump's economic record and GOP control of Congress in jeopardy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo far, the various trade actions are only expected to nick the U.S. GDP growth that has picked up steam.That's why the stock market, whose current prices adjust to reflect altered expectations for earnings and economic growth over the intermediate term, seems to be the most likely catalyst to head off a widening Trump trade war.But right now, stock markets appear only slightly worried. On Friday, the Trump administration said that it will impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports from China on July 6. That spurred China to announce $34 billion in retaliatory tariffs. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index sold off initially, but rallied to close Friday with modest losses.After a weak open Monday on the stock market today, the Dow Jones pared losses but notch its fifth straight down session, falling 0.4%. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower, and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended at break-even levels.For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but that may not hold. Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research, wrote that his bullish stock-market outlook requires Trump's ""benevolent Dr. Jekyll persona"" of tax-cutter and deregulator to triumph over his protectionist Mr. Hyde.""If his tariffs trigger widespread retaliation and an outright global trade war, then earnings will take a dive,"" Yardeni wrote. ""We continue to expect that it will all end peaceably. But it isn't heading in that direction right now.""UniCredit Group chief economist Erik Nielsen wrote that he thinks markets are too optimistic about the risk of a broadening trade war and sees potential for ""some rough months ahead in global equity markets.""""Markets haven't taken this increasingly serious risk into account, but rather focused on the ongoing macro developments, possibly dismissing Trump's threats,"" Nielsen wrote.Here's something to keep in mind: A couple of months before imposing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., China suddenly stopped buying soybeans from U.S. farmers, shifting orders to Brazil and Canada. Suddenly, China started subjecting shipments of Ford Motor (F) vehicles, apples and pork to closer inspection and other regulatory hurdles.A Trump trade war can hurt U.S. multinationals with big China exposure like Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL) beyond official tariffs or quotas. The U.S. increasingly looks as if it is headed into a technological cold war with China. China doesn't want to disrupt its economy as it is still developing its technological capabilities. But Beijing may seek opportunities to steer business to non-U.S. countries as it looks to divide America from potential allies in a trade war vs. China.After Trump appeared ready to greenlight component sales to ZTE, bringing it back from the dead, China seemed ready to sign off on the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors. Yet now the Qualcomm deal may again be in jeopardy.On Monday, Qualcomm stock fell 1.1%. As for notable Dow Jones stocks, Caterpillar and Boeing closed down 0.9%. Apple, which outsources its iPhone manufacturing in China, edged 0.1% lower.Trump seemed to understand this dynamic when he kicked around the idea of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trading bloc. Yet Trump has instead stiff-armed U.S. allies in trade talks and weakened his leverage with China. So it may take a stock-market tumble to convince Trump that the trade-war campaign isn't working.After the stock market panned his steel and aluminum tariffs, Trump, albeit temporarily, granted broad exemptions that minimized both their economic impact and investor concern.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Forget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarThis Four Top Stocks Are Near Buy PointsJD.com Up On Google Investment, Retail Infrastructure PlansIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

117,A,"Leonard Cohen had most of his life savings stolen. But rather than being fazed by it, he started over — at 73 years old.And it set the stage for a final act for the ages.Cohen (1934-2016) was the influential singer-song writer who for five decades stood the test of time. He's in both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The latter said of Cohen: ""Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.""He's been compared to Bob Dylan as far as influencing his generation. ""Cohen's haunting bass voice, nylon-stringed guitar patterns … shaped evocative songs,"" Rolling Stone magazine said.When Cohen's former manager, Kelly Lynch, embezzled over $5 million from him — most of his retirement money — he took her to court in 2005. He was awarded $9 million in a civil judgment in 2006 but received nothing from Lynch.""I had to go to work,"" Cohen said in 2005, as quoted in ""Leonard Cohen on Leonard Cohen,"" edited by Jeff Burger. ""I have no money left. I'm not saying it's bad; I have enough of an understanding of the way the world works to understand that these things happen. ... I said, 'Let me start fresh at 70. I can cobble together a little nest egg again.' """"Perseverance and talent aside, Cohen succeeded by being his own inimitable self rather than chasing after success,"" Burger told IBD. ""He cared about success only to the extent that it allowed him to put food on the table and keep working. He was never particularly interested in wealth or fame. He was genuine to the core.""In 2008 Cohen undertook his first world tour in 15 years. It lasted until 2013 and encompassed close to 400 performances. He performed to the largest audiences he'd ever had. And the three studio albums he released in the last five years of his life were the most commercially successful records of his career.""He was also the rare artist of his generation to enjoy artistic success into his 80s,"" Rolling Stone said.Cohen was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. He was 73. He was appointed Companion of the Order of Canada, that nation's highest civilian honor, in 2011. He also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award that same year.""I just set out to write what I felt as honestly as I could, and I am delighted when other people feel a part of themselves in the music,"" Cohen said, as quoted by Harvey Kubernik in ""Leonard Cohen: Everybody Knows.""""If there's a universal lesson in Leonard Cohen's life and career,"" Burger said, ""it's that perseverance can pay off. And it's never too late to score a major success. Cohen's first album didn't come out until he was 33, (and he) didn't really begin reaching mass audiences until 40 years later.""""I was in it for the long haul,"" Cohen said in 1993 at age 58. ""And the long haul for all of us is a lifetime."" He added that ""any artist should be better with time; there's more experience, more maturity, hopefully more vision.""Born to a well-to-do family in Westmount, Quebec, Cohen lost his father at age 9. He wrote a farewell to him ""and sewed it into his bow tie and buried it in the garden where the pansy (flowers) grew,"" Cohen said. ""He always used to wear a pansy in his lapel. That did something good for my head so I kept on writing.""He also learned to play the guitar as a teenager and started a folk group.Cohen went on to become a poet and novelist. In 1956 his first book of poems was published. He won the McGill University Literary Award. In 1959 he earned a grant from the Canada Council that funded a European writing excursion. He earned another one in 1961.He went on to write other books of poetry and novels. But while he was getting published and his work was well-received, he wasn't making much of a living from writing.A return visit to New York City in the mid-1960s left him influenced by the Greenwich Village folk-song culture. He decided to put his poems to melodies. Cohen's big break came in 1967. Judy Collins recorded two of Cohen's songs, ""Suzanne"" and ""Dress Rehearsal Rag."" Other artists such as James Taylor and Willie Nelson were soon asking Cohen to write songs for them.He quickly moved on to performing. By the end of 1967 he recorded his debut album, ""The Songs of Leonard Cohen."" And in 1969 he recorded ""Songs from a Room,"" which featured ""Bird on a Wire.""Singing and songwriting brought him acclaim and financial success. He continued to record through the 1970s. His popularity declined in the 1980s. But his 1984 album ""Various Positions"" included what would become Cohen's signature song, ""Hallelujah."" Although the song didn't receive acclaim until the mid-1990s, ""Hallelujah"" has since been sung by hundreds of artists and has been featured in films and TV shows.""I've only learned one thing writing songs and that is, if you stay with it long enough the song will yield,"" Cohen said. ""But 'long enough' is beyond any reasonable length of what long enough might suggest to you. You might think it's a few months — it might be a year or two.""He said songwriting was a long and difficult process for him. It made him ""run through word after word after word and test every idea. I have to write perfectly many verses that get thrown away because they are imperfect for a particular song; and it takes time and patience and tears to get there.""""Leonard certainly had a drive, this need to take notes, to write, to study to somehow make sense of (life),"" said Cohen's foremost biographer, Sylvie Simmons, to IBD. She authored ""I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen."" ""He was a student. He studied very deeply right up until the end of his life. Leonard was a very disciplined man. He had this drive and this discipline to get through almost any obstacles.""Cohen's 2008-2013 tour was one of the biggest-grossing ones in music history, Simmons says. ""Leonard was met by a tsunami of love everywhere he went. Even then he was showing this kind of humility of taking his hat off and holding it over his heart when different band members were playing things on their own. He always liked to give the credit to other people.""""The hardest thing about touring with Leonard was that he spoiled me for everyone else,"" said Perla Batalla, a backup singer for Cohen before embarking on a successful solo career. ""He treats everyone in his universe with the same degree of respect and kindness.""Cohen said he was writing all the time. He wrote right up to his death. Simmons says Cohen carried a little black notebook everywhere so when an idea or inspiration popped into his head, he captured it on paper. It was all part of the process for him.""I've accepted the fact that I sweat over every word,"" he said. ""But why shouldn't my work be hard? Almost everybody's work is hard. One is distracted by this notion that there is such a thing as inspiration, that it comes fast and easy. And some people are graced by that style. I'm not. So I have to work as hard as (anyone) to come up with the payload.""Inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Recipient of Companion of the Order of Canada and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.Overcame: Setbacks in his career and life.Lesson: If you believe in what you're doing, stay true to yourself.""At times when commercial defeats and setbacks happened, I wasn't too troubled, because I knew the worth of the work, and I look back on a lot of my songs and poems and feel good about them because a lot of them have lasted.""

118,A,"Check out the way Facebook stock has responded to the data-breach scandal that smacked the company earlier this year, and it seems clear the social networking giant's long apology tour has helped lift the stock.XOn the public relations and Facebook (FB) news pages of the company's website, there are headlines such as ""Removing Bad Actors From Facebook."" It says Facebook took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the company is still running a media blitz that started in May called ""Facing Facts,"" an explanatory campaign that includes national commercial broadcasts and regular messages to Facebook users.Facebook also is trying to keep users updated on what it's doing to prevent false news and how its fact-checking program is working. It has pledged to commit a task force of 20,000 people to get the job done.Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, has called the data breach the darkest chapter in Facebook's 14-year history. Still, he says, the fundamental damage to the social network's platform has been ""very contained.""""We're seeing minimal damage over the last few months, in terms of user engagement, trends and advertising,"" said Ives. ""Facebook is going through a hand-holding period with users, regulators and app developers to make sure these things can't be repeated.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs details of the data breach emerged, Facebook stock plunged 24% from a high of 195.32 on Feb. 1 to a one-year low of 149.02 on March 26. But the stock has rebounded 32% since then, indicating Facebook's mea culpa and recovery plan is working. Facebook stock surged to another all-time high of 203.55 on June 20. On Monday, shares gained 1.6% to close at 197.36 on the stock market today.Facebook's data breach involved research firm Cambridge Analytica and its access to personal information from 87 million users of the social network. The breach seeped its way into the U.S. presidential election of 2016, due to its connection with alleged Russian meddling.In subsequent congressional hearings, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before both House and Senate panels, giving 10 hours worth of testimony. Since then, Facebook has faced a storm of criticism from users, advertisers and regulators over the past few months, both in the U.S. and Europe.Facebook's troubles helped spur the European Union into implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which created data protection rules across Europe. It took effect in May, and Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit already have complied.But it has also raised a question as to whether digital advertising revenue at Facebook and Google will be impacted long-term by a regulatory wave in Europe and in the U.S.""It's created some disruption but I think the bark is worse than the bite,"" said GBH's Ives. Ives has a rating of highly attractive on Facebook stock and price target of 225.Whatever troubles Facebook is facing hasn't slowed its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. Facebook's first-quarter revenue jumped 49% from the year-ago period to $11.96 billion, along with 63% growth in earnings per share.For the second quarter, analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue growth of 43% to $13.3 billion. They also see 30% growth in earnings per share.Working in Facebook's favor is its massive size. It has 2.2 billion monthly active users, one-third of the world's global population. That's up 14% from the same period a year ago. About 1.45 billion people log on daily, spending an average of 20 minutes per visit.Put it all together and Facebook has enormous influence among advertisers, which account for about 96% of its revenue. Facebook's clout, resulting from the large amount of data it has on users, is matched only by Google. Combined, the two rake in about 60% of digital advertising spending. That includes Alphabet's YouTube.Other social networking sites, including Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Pinterest and Yelp (YELP) have hardly put a dent in Facebook's armor.All this is occurring while Facebook stock still has several revenue-growth levers to pull. Its biggest ace-in-the-hole right now is Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing mobile platform that just surpassed 1 billion users. Compare that with Snap's Snapchat, which had 191 million users at the end of the first quarter.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads. The company does not break out Instagram revenue. It is, however, seen by analysts as a core revenue driver with a lot of room to accelerate.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves believes ad revenue will more than double from a year ago to $8.9 billion. By 2020, he thinks Instagram will account for 26% of Facebook's total revenue.""As core Facebook matures, Instagram is the key to the next leg of growth,"" Hargreaves wrote in a report to clients this month. He has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 245.""Facebook continues to grow its core user base and increase the effectiveness of its advertising offerings, which, when combined with a massive opportunity to grow Instagram and monetize its messaging products, we believe creates a substantial opportunity for future growth for many years,"" he wrote.Another growth lever is the Facebook Messenger platform.This past month, analysts have spotted some of the first advertisements on Messenger. That includes ads from Staples, Uber and Peloton.""Just in the last two weeks we have seen consistent ads in Facebook Messenger for the first time,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a June 19 note to clients. Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion monthly active users.Mahaney thinks Messenger could contribute $6 billion to $8 billion in revenue. That translates into $1 in earnings per share to the company by 2020. He has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 250.Another future growth lever is Facebook's other messaging platform, WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion users.There is one overhang out there that analysts are watching closely. The issue is whether younger users are abandoning the platform for social apps considered more ""cool,"" or other reasons. It's already happening, but not to a level that has yet threatened the stock, GBH's Ives says.Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America's youth. But it no longer is the most popular online platform among teens, a recent Pew Research Center survey said. In a survey on Facebook and teenage usage, about half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, but they use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat more often, in that order.Notably, it said 95% of those teens have a smartphone, with almost half saying they ""almost constantly"" use the internet. That's a big pool of advertising opportunity.""That's been a challenging demographic for them and speaks to why the Instagram acquisition will go down as one of Zuckerberg's best moves in the evolution of Facebook,"" said Ives.

119,A,"Medical products stock Align Technology pulled back in the four sessions through Friday, breaking its eight-week rally and tripping a stock-selling signal for swing-trade investors.The developer of the widely used clear orthodontic braces broke out of a cup-with-handle base on April 18. Align Technology (ALGN) immediately dropped more than 8% below the base's 277.41 buy point, triggering the automatic cut-loss rule. Shares turned and retook the buy point in healthy trade on May 10 and 11.The eight-week advance drove shares to as high as 371.55 on June 18, 34% above the April entry. CAN SLIM investors should have taken at least some profit as the stock climbed past the 20% gain mark at the end of May.Active short-term investors may also have carved off another piece of profit as the stock broke below its 10-day moving average on Friday. It was the first such break since retaking the buy point in May.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 5-day and 10-day lines act as early warning devices to help lock in profit. It is entirely possible that the stock would reverse course and surge to new highs. But it's equally likely that the stock will either fall further, or settle into a weekslong consolidation likely to eventually produce another buy point.The odds suggest that taking a piece of the position off the table in defense of those possibilities leads to more gain than pain. But there is no reason to exit the stock entirely.The San Jose, Calif.-based company's prospects remain healthy. Analyst consensus projects a 30% EPS gain this year, followed by a 27% advance in 2019.Revenue is forecast to grow 32% and 24% for the two years. Consensus views look for a 27% EPS gain to $1.08 in the second quarter. Align has cleared consensus expectations over the past four quarters, with beats ranging from 16% to 24%.But the company could be due for some moderation in growth. The big-cap stock's annual revenue surged 36% last year, and it is set to break the $2 billion barrier in 2019. Annual earnings growth accelerated to 56% last year. Quarterly EPS growth rates hit 100% and 98% in Q4 and Q1. A sharp slowdown from those levels could trigger another form of sell signal.RELATED: Use The 10-Day Moving Average To Get Ahead Of Sell Signals Know This Sell Signal: Earnings Slowdown Says 'Sell,' But It Can Be ...How Far Will Abiomed, 3 More Growth Stocks In The Medical Sector Run?

120,A,"As the nation's largest nuclear power producer, Exelon (EXC) is a utility company of a different stripe.Because nuclear power emissions are cleaner than coal and other types of generation, Exelon boasts a low-pollution advantage. Exelon's role also makes it a player in energy politics. The company is contributing funds to a campaign for a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, Bloomberg reported.Nuclear plants do require more safety measures. After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan that severely damaged the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant, Exelon hardened its U.S. plants. Nuclear waste is a pesky problem, too.Exelon said this month it is shutting down in October the 50-year-old Oyster Creek nuclear power plant outside Philadelphia.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseExelon serves 10 million customers through its subsidiaries in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Maryland. Besides nuclear power, it also has gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric generating plants.The stock is trying to clear resistance around 41.50 to 42 on its chart. Although Exelon has formed many bases in the past several years, the stock normally makes small gains from its breakouts. That's fairly typical of utility stocks, which are prized more for their dividends than their share appreciation.Exelon pays a quarterly dividend of 34.5 cents a share, which computes to an annualized dividend yield of 3.3%.Since the company slashed its dividend from 52.5 cents to 31 cents in 2013, the payout has been raised each year starting in 2016, according to Exelon's website. The utility's goal is to raise dividends 5% each year through 2020.The corporate tax cut is expected to increase EPS by 10 cents a share in 2019, and to result in savings to customers of more than $500 million a year.RELATED:This Dividend Stock Won't Put You To SleepHigh-Yielding Oil Stocks Mixed Amid Recent Crude Oil VolatilityThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

121,A,"Leonard Cohen had most of his life savings stolen. But rather than being fazed by it, he started over — at 73 years old.And it set the stage for a final act for the ages.Cohen (1934-2016) was the influential singer-song writer who for five decades stood the test of time. He's in both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The latter said of Cohen: ""Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.""He's been compared to Bob Dylan as far as influencing his generation. ""Cohen's haunting bass voice, nylon-stringed guitar patterns … shaped evocative songs,"" Rolling Stone magazine said.When Cohen's former manager, Kelly Lynch, embezzled over $5 million from him — most of his retirement money — he took her to court in 2005. He was awarded $9 million in a civil judgment in 2006 but received nothing from Lynch.""I had to go to work,"" Cohen said in 2005, as quoted in ""Leonard Cohen on Leonard Cohen,"" edited by Jeff Burger. ""I have no money left. I'm not saying it's bad; I have enough of an understanding of the way the world works to understand that these things happen. ... I said, 'Let me start fresh at 70. I can cobble together a little nest egg again.' """"Perseverance and talent aside, Cohen succeeded by being his own inimitable self rather than chasing after success,"" Burger told IBD. ""He cared about success only to the extent that it allowed him to put food on the table and keep working. He was never particularly interested in wealth or fame. He was genuine to the core.""In 2008 Cohen undertook his first world tour in 15 years. It lasted until 2013 and encompassed close to 400 performances. He performed to the largest audiences he'd ever had. And the three studio albums he released in the last five years of his life were the most commercially successful records of his career.""He was also the rare artist of his generation to enjoy artistic success into his 80s,"" Rolling Stone said.Cohen was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. He was 73. He was appointed Companion of the Order of Canada, that nation's highest civilian honor, in 2011. He also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award that same year.""I just set out to write what I felt as honestly as I could, and I am delighted when other people feel a part of themselves in the music,"" Cohen said, as quoted by Harvey Kubernik in ""Leonard Cohen: Everybody Knows.""""If there's a universal lesson in Leonard Cohen's life and career,"" Burger said, ""it's that perseverance can pay off. And it's never too late to score a major success. Cohen's first album didn't come out until he was 33, (and he) didn't really begin reaching mass audiences until 40 years later.""""I was in it for the long haul,"" Cohen said in 1993 at age 58. ""And the long haul for all of us is a lifetime."" He added that ""any artist should be better with time; there's more experience, more maturity, hopefully more vision.""Born to a well-to-do family in Westmount, Quebec, Cohen lost his father at age 9. He wrote a farewell to him ""and sewed it into his bow tie and buried it in the garden where the pansy (flowers) grew,"" Cohen said. ""He always used to wear a pansy in his lapel. That did something good for my head so I kept on writing.""He also learned to play the guitar as a teenager and started a folk group.Cohen went on to become a poet and novelist. In 1956 his first book of poems was published. He won the McGill University Literary Award. In 1959 he earned a grant from the Canada Council that funded a European writing excursion. He earned another one in 1961.He went on to write other books of poetry and novels. But while he was getting published and his work was well-received, he wasn't making much of a living from writing.A return visit to New York City in the mid-1960s left him influenced by the Greenwich Village folk-song culture. He decided to put his poems to melodies. Cohen's big break came in 1967. Judy Collins recorded two of Cohen's songs, ""Suzanne"" and ""Dress Rehearsal Rag."" Other artists such as James Taylor and Willie Nelson were soon asking Cohen to write songs for them.He quickly moved on to performing. By the end of 1967 he recorded his debut album, ""The Songs of Leonard Cohen."" And in 1969 he recorded ""Songs from a Room,"" which featured ""Bird on a Wire.""Singing and songwriting brought him acclaim and financial success. He continued to record through the 1970s. His popularity declined in the 1980s. But his 1984 album ""Various Positions"" included what would become Cohen's signature song, ""Hallelujah."" Although the song didn't receive acclaim until the mid-1990s, ""Hallelujah"" has since been sung by hundreds of artists and has been featured in films and TV shows.""I've only learned one thing writing songs and that is, if you stay with it long enough the song will yield,"" Cohen said. ""But 'long enough' is beyond any reasonable length of what long enough might suggest to you. You might think it's a few months — it might be a year or two.""He said songwriting was a long and difficult process for him. It made him ""run through word after word after word and test every idea. I have to write perfectly many verses that get thrown away because they are imperfect for a particular song; and it takes time and patience and tears to get there.""""Leonard certainly had a drive, this need to take notes, to write, to study to somehow make sense of (life),"" said Cohen's foremost biographer, Sylvie Simmons, to IBD. She authored ""I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen."" ""He was a student. He studied very deeply right up until the end of his life. Leonard was a very disciplined man. He had this drive and this discipline to get through almost any obstacles.""Cohen's 2008-2013 tour was one of the biggest-grossing ones in music history, Simmons says. ""Leonard was met by a tsunami of love everywhere he went. Even then he was showing this kind of humility of taking his hat off and holding it over his heart when different band members were playing things on their own. He always liked to give the credit to other people.""""The hardest thing about touring with Leonard was that he spoiled me for everyone else,"" said Perla Batalla, a backup singer for Cohen before embarking on a successful solo career. ""He treats everyone in his universe with the same degree of respect and kindness.""Cohen said he was writing all the time. He wrote right up to his death. Simmons says Cohen carried a little black notebook everywhere so when an idea or inspiration popped into his head, he captured it on paper. It was all part of the process for him.""I've accepted the fact that I sweat over every word,"" he said. ""But why shouldn't my work be hard? Almost everybody's work is hard. One is distracted by this notion that there is such a thing as inspiration, that it comes fast and easy. And some people are graced by that style. I'm not. So I have to work as hard as (anyone) to come up with the payload.""Inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Recipient of Companion of the Order of Canada and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.Overcame: Setbacks in his career and life.Lesson: If you believe in what you're doing, stay true to yourself.""At times when commercial defeats and setbacks happened, I wasn't too troubled, because I knew the worth of the work, and I look back on a lot of my songs and poems and feel good about them because a lot of them have lasted.""

124,A,"Harley-Davidson (HOG) warned on Monday that European Union retaliation for Trump tariffs on steel and aluminum will cost it close to $100 million a year, forcing the company to shift some production out of the U.S.XMoving production overseas ""is not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe,"" Harley said in a Monday filing.The disclosure reveals the mounting cost of the President Trump's confrontational trade policy and, in particular, his controversial decision to justify Trump tariffs on U.S. allies based on national security grounds.Harley stock plunged 6% to 41.57 on the stock market today, as trade concerns had the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 tumbling. Harley fell 2.2% on Friday as EU tariffs against Harley took effect.The EU, like Canada, Mexico and China all are aiming retaliatory tariffs at targets aimed to weaken Trump and the GOP in key political battlegrounds. Trump has already shown he is sensitive to tariffs aimed at American farmers, nearly reaching a trade deal with Beijing that would have boosted Chinese imports of U.S. agricultural goods, instead of putting billions of dollars in sales at risk. While such a deal might still happen, trade tensions with China are likely to intensify this week as the U.S. gets set to announce investment restrictions meant to keep key technology out of Beijing's hands.Meanwhile, Trump is threatening to slap 20% tariffs on U.S. auto imports from Germany and the rest of Europe, which would dramatically escalate the conflict.Harley said in a Monday filing that EU tariffs on its motorcycles built in the U.S. just jumped from 6% to 31%, adding roughly $2,200 to the cost of each. To avoid harming dealers and undermining its business, Harley said it will swallow the cost.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden.""The company noted that ramping up production in international plants will require incremental investment and take nine to 18 months.The EU is Harley's most important market outside of the U.S., accounting for 40,000 sales in 2017. The company didn't note how U.S. workers would be affected but plans to detail financial implications as well as ways to mitigate the impact of retaliatory EU tariffs during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call on July 24.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Dow Jones Futures Fall As U.S. Plans China Tech Curbs: These 5 Top Stocks Are Near Buy PointsIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisThree Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep TumblingStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

125,A,"Taxes: Whatever you think about the issue of taxing internet sales, the simple fact is that the Supreme Court has just guaranteed that people across the country will now be paying more in state taxes. It's hard for us to see how this is good news.In its 5-4 decision on South Dakota v. Wayfair, the court overturned two previous rulings that prevented states from taxing sales of out-of-state companies. That meant a catalog company based in Maine didn't have to navigate 45 state sales-tax laws to figure out how much each customer owed, and then remit that money to the right states.Brick-and-mortar stores have been trying to lift this ban for decades, because, they say, it unfairly tilts the playing field in favor of catalog and online retailers. According to the Government Accountability Office, this break cost states up to $13.4 billion in lost revenue last year alone. And, retailers say it cost jobs and hurt local economies.Not surprisingly, Amazon.com  (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), Etsy (ETSY), Wayfair (W) and other e-commerce stocks dropped on Thursday.The Supreme Court ruling was notable not just because it did something it rarely does — namely, overturn previous decisions. (The most recent, Quill v North Dakota, was in 1992.) The court also split in a highly unusual way.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the majority side were rock-ribbed conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who sided with Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion. But so did stalwart liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Kennedy argued that the explosive growth of online retail rendered the court's previous rulings outdated.Three of the other liberals on the court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, sided with Chief Justice Roberts' dissent. Roberts argued that it should be up to Congress to make a change like this.Whatever the merits of the decision, the Court's ruling means not only higher taxes for consumers, but higher prices.Keep in mind that despite online retail's explosive growth, the internet still accounts for less than 10% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Plus, at least some of that growth represents entirely new sales that never would have occurred in an offline world.At the same time, the ruling means that online retailers — large and small — will soon have to comply with nearly 10,000 different tax jurisdictions across the country in the 45 states that impose sales taxes. That means different rates, varying definitions of products, and a variety of exemptions. The resulting complexity is mind-boggling.In New York, for example, clothing and footwear costing less than $110 is exempt from state sales tax, but not in some local jurisdictions. New York taxes shower caps and walking boots, but not swimming caps or hiking boots, says Avalara (AVLR), which makes automated tax software.Some states treat diapers as a health care item exempt from taxation, and others treat them as clothing. A few years ago, Wisconsin issued a 1,437-word bulletin explaining how the state taxed different forms of ice cream cakes. Then there are the various state tax ""holidays"" meant to goose sales.It is true that some states have tried to simplify their sales taxes to reduce compliance costs. And there are consulting firms that can help companies navigate this minefield.But there can be no doubt that this ruling means a higher cost of doing business. In fact, Avalara stock shot up 13.5% after the court's ruling. Tax complexity is always good news for tax consultants.In addition, smaller online firms will now be at a disadvantage, not only with local brick-and-mortar businesses that only have to comply with one state's sales-tax laws, but against online giants that can easily absorb the extra compliance costs.Worse still, the court may have opened the door to letting states impose other taxes on out-of-state firms.Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform argues that states could use this ruling to impose corporate taxes and even income taxes across state lines.""If physical nexus is no longer required for sales taxes ,then it is no longer required for personal or corporate income taxes,"" he said. ""Now, California (or any state or city that loses population through exit) can tax people and businesses who do their best to avoid that state or city.""If you think that's a fanciful prediction, you haven't been paying attention. State governments will take every opportunity they can to raise taxes — especially if their own residents aren't the ones paying them.In the end, it makes Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts' dissent look all the wiser.As he noted, the online retail industry has thrived up until now based on the existing rules regarding sales taxes.""Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy,"" he wrote, ""should be undertaken by Congress.""Anyone Notice That Trump Is Now Tied With 'Popular' Obama On Job Approval?The Economy Is Not An Engine — So Stop Describing It Like OneTrump Didn't Sign G-7's Leftist Agenda — Smart MoveMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

127,A,"Cutting losses quickly is critical to success in swing trading. You must have a set stop loss and the discipline to act if it hits. With China trade war headlines jostling stocks, you need to know where to put your stop loss for the protection it provides.Baozun (BZUN) had a lot to offer as a swing trade opportunity. It's a member of the computer enterprise software group, one of the top-performing groups of this year. Its last earnings report acted as a catalyst for a strong breakout (1), vaulting 20% move in the next few weeks. Rather than fretting over the missed opportunity in Baozun's move, you can look for a new opportunity in a pullback. In this case, a bullish reversal presented itself as the stock fell below 60 then powered back above it in a single day (2).Typically in a reversal, we look for the price to surpass the previous day's close to confirm the strength. The reversal day fell short in that regard. But the next day, the stock opened above the reversal day high and started making progress early in the trading day (3). Baozun joined IBD's SwingTrader at an early entry of 62.36. But before entering a trade, you need to determine where to put your stop loss.For reversals, we often look to the low of the reversal day as our stop loss. In this case, that would amount to an excessive risk for a swing trade at nearly 10%. Using the low of the entry day would normally be an acceptable alternative, but that was too tight.There seemed to be an area of support around 60 from a few weeks back on the daily chart and this matched up nicely with an area of support on the intraday chart. At over a 3% risk percentage it was on the higher side but still reasonable. You could also reduce the risk to your portfolio by adjusting your position size.Two days later, short-term market conditions worsened and Baozun hit our stop loss (4). It's not fun taking a loss, but it is a part of trading. Sure, by the end of the day the stock was above our stop loss but you don't know if it will come back when your stop loss triggers. You have to protect yourself from the loss potentially growing.The China trade war rhetoric continued the next week and Baozun fell 10% the day after we removed it from SwingTrader. It continued falling throughout the week. If you don't respect your stop loss, you set yourself up for devastating losses.It's bad enough that you reduce the capital in your portfolio. It means starting with less money for your next opportunity. But even worse is what a large loss can do to your emotional capital. You can get more timid at the next move, investing less or investing late. That's the hidden cost of big losses. Cut losses short, respect your stop losses and it will save you from a lot of costly mistakes.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED: What To Do When A Swing Trade Doesn't WorkCutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

Winfrey, who recently signed a deal to make video programming for Apple (AAPL), could soon be pointing to the iPhone maker and shouting ""You get a car!""Apple has long been rumored to be working on a self-driving electric car, but the buzz has died down over the past year or so. Speculation shifted from Apple making its own vehicle, which some dubbed the iCar, to it making autonomous-car technology to supply to existing automakers.Guggenheim analyst Robert Cihra predicted Wednesday that Apple eventually will come out with its own car. In a report titled, ""The Ongoing Case for an Apple iCar,"" Cihra said the market opportunity is simply too large for Apple to ignore.""We believe Apple needs big new TAMs (total addressable markets) to keep growing and we reiterate our expectation that it ultimately launches a self-driving car, irrespective of contrary news flow and even its own hesitations to date,"" Cihra said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Apple has signed video content deals with Winfrey, filmmakers Steven Spielberg and M. Night Shyamalan, among others.Cihra reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 215. Apple shares rose 0.7% to 185.50 on the stock market today.The automotive business is one of few markets that could help Apple realize meaningful sales growth, he said.""Consensus is that Apple has pulled back on ambitions to launch a car and is now just focusing on autonomous tech to sell to others,"" he said. But Apple has never acted as a supplier of core technology to others. Its business model is to own and control the end-to-end experience, Cihra said.Apple has a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. It also has filed patents in autonomous vehicle control, guidance and navigation systems. There's also related neural networking, lidar detection, camera and machine vision systems. Plus, it has patents in vehicle climate control and body structure, Cihra said.""Given the market's sheer size and parallels to Apple's historical MO, we remain convinced that it will inevitably be drawn into launching its own car,"" Cihra said.Apple recently hired Jaime Waydo, lead systems engineer for Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's Waymo self-driving cars. That follows the hiring in April of Google's former senior vice president of engineering, John Giannandrea.

130,A,"Few ideas are more dangerous in investing than the conviction that ""my side of the ship isn't sinking."" The bow may rise as the stern sinks, but that's nothing to be complacent about. Divergence in the stock market is a worrisome sign.Going into Monday's session, the Nasdaq and the small-cap S&P 600 were each up 11% year to date. But the large-cap S&P 500 lagged with a 3% gain, and the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 0.6%.The Stock Spotlight screen confirms the divergence. Of the 16 stocks in the screen, four are members of the S&P 600. Year to date, the four held an average gain of 67% as of Friday's close. The remaining 12 were up an average of 43% for the year.Here are the four S&P 600 stocks and their action from legitimate buy points:Medifast (MED) was consolidating at the end of 2017. The stock staged a breakaway gap March 7 and advanced 124% from its June 20 high of 179.52. Medifast has since pulled back roughly 15% from the high.The small-cap provider of diet and health products is expected to grow earnings 56% in the second quarter.However, shareholders should ignore the fundamentals when selling a stock. A stock should be sold mainly by the chart: A chart breakdown usually happens long before the fundamentals show a problem.Medifast is far extended and logged a 12% loss in heavy trade on Thursday, its biggest percentage loss in the entire run. The big loss constitutes a change in character.Investors who are still in the stock would be wise to book the profit.Home-nursing services provider Amedisys (AMED) hesitated after clearing a 61.88 buy point in March. The stock fell 4% below the buy point in early April but then found traction.An IBD-style investor who bought at the breakout conceivably could've held even after the stock reached the 20% profit-taking zone. Why? The stock showed very bullish action May 8 (an 8% gain in volume 160% above average) as it came within a dime of the 20% profit level.An investor could've cashed in a 40% gain Friday.Portable oxygen provider Inogen (INGN) broke out in April and advanced 43% from a 135.07 buy point. The stock is about 6% off its high.Inogen gapped up 23% on May 1, but action has been choppy since then. Here again, taking profits makes sense.Diagnostic-test developer Neogen (NEOG) broke out in March and rose about 31%. The stock is about 3% off its high. Monday's action was wide and loose, a good reason to take the profit.Taking profits at 20% to 25% and cutting losses at 7% to 8% is a solid approach in any market. This is even more important in a news-driven market like the current one.The stock market doesn't have to resolve the divergence in favor of the bears. Yet the bulls are going to need help to resolve the current situation in their favor.What could fire up the stock market?If President Trump settles the trade issues, a strong relief rally is possible. But Trump appears to be stuck on a protectionist path that is making investors uncomfortable, and trade partners are retaliating.RELATED:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedWill Trump's Hoover-Like Stance On Tariffs Sink Stocks?These Stock Plays Trouncing The MarketThe Nuclear Option In Dividend Investing

131,A,"How much of a drop below the 10-week moving average should you tolerate before you sell a stock?58.com (WUBA) was a stock that was held on Leaderboard while it made a few pullbacks to or even below the 10-week line. It wasn't booted until it made a distinct break of that line, which teaches investors the importance of judging action at the 10-week line properly.The Chinese internet company, sometimes called the Craigslist of China, was added to Leaderboard on July 10 (1). At the time, the stock was breaking out of a cup without handle in double its usual volume. The base was well-crafted, with no wild price swings and a symmetrical outline.The stock closed slightly below the 47.48 buy point on the day of the breakout, but the next day it finished business above it. From that point on, shares never looked back. 58.com kept adding gains apace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Aug. 21, the company reported quarterly earnings. With some cushion from the entry, we decided to keep the stock through the report. The cushion would help absorb losses if results sparked a sell-off. Instead, shares soared more than 20% on the earnings announcement, widening the profit from the buy point.Some of the gains were wiped out in a Sept. 25 sell-off (2). But 58.com held at the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. That was a signal to continue holding. In fact, the show of support became a follow-on buy area for investors to add some shares and enhance their returns. Indeed, the stock quickly bounced back.By late October it was back to the 10-week line. This time, 58.com traded below the line, something that had not occurred in the entire run (3). Still, it was a modest drop below the moving average, and on Halloween the stock was right back above the line.In early December, a similar harmless pullback occurred (4). Yet there was something different this time. 58.com took longer to rebound, and a five-week cuplike pattern was actually an improper base. The stock managed to make some gains, but the peak was coming into focus.On Feb. 2, the stock closed the week down 15% and below the 10-week moving average (5). Notably, volume was 52% above average for the week. When a stock closes the week below the 10-week line in weekly volume at least 40% above average, that's a sell signal — one that had not appeared in earlier pullbacks.Conscious that 58.com was well past a standard 25% gain from the buy point, Leaderboard editors decided to remove the stock from the Leaders list. The profit from the breakout was more than 55%.Since then, 58.com has stalled. The stock broke out of another base on April 30, and was added back to the Leaders list at that time. But it was removed about three weeks later due to slack price action.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

133,A,"All of a sudden, everyone on the left wants ""free markets in energy policy."" As someone who's advocated for that for, oh, about three decades, this riff should be music to my ears. But is laissez faire energy policy really what liberals are seeking?First, some context. A few weeks ago, liberal activists leaked a draft of a Trump administration directive that would order utilities to purchase coal and nuclear power as part of their energy mix in supplying electricity to homes and businesses.There are good arguments for and against this policy — I'm fairly neutral — but what was fascinating was the indignant response from those on the left who hate fossil fuels. ""Crony capitalism!"" they shrieked in unison. Catherine Rampell, an economic columnist at The Washington Post, moaned that President Donald Trump ""is wielding the power of the state to keep uncompetitive companies in business, and costing taxpayers and consumers lots of money in the process."" ""If that doesn't count as 'picking winners and losers,' it's hard to say what would,"" Rampell wrote.The Los Angeles Times slammed the Trump plan as ""a preposterous idea"": ""Continuing to operate financially nonviable power plants and forcing grid operators to buy power they don't need or want is an unacceptable governmental intrusion into the power market that, by one analysis, would needlessly cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.""This could cost hundreds of millions of dollars? That's bad, for sure, but have you ever heard the Los Angeles Times rail against subsidies for wind and solar power? I haven't. The Obama administration's policy was to try to bankrupt coal, oil and other fossil fuels through regulation, while enriching their renewable energy pals in Silicon Valley with lavish subsidies.Remember Solyndra? That was the company that was going to revolutionize solar power, and it went bankrupt after the Obama administration gave the firm hundreds of millions of dollars. All told, $150 billion was pipelined into the green empire under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and most of the money funded such fiascoes. But now Trump is the one who is accused of ""picking winners and losers""?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAn even bigger farce is the idea that Adam Smith's invisible hand of free market forces is what is driving certain nuclear power and coal plants into bankruptcy. (Coal still provides five times more electric power than wind and solar combined.) Rampell of The Washington Post explains: ""The reason these (coal and nuclear) plants are struggling, after all, is that they can't compete with cheaper natural gas and renewables."" That's half-true. Yes, $3 natural gas prices have revolutionized the electric power markets and driven down costs.But the idea that renewables are ""cheap"" is a lie, and those on the left know it. Let's be clear about an economic reality that environmentalists have spent four decades trying to hide: Without massive government subsidies, there would be no wind or solar energy to speak of. They are complete creatures of government favoritism; and after 30 years, we still can't cut the umbilical cord.Consider how gargantuan the green energy subsidies are. First, wind and solar receive a tax credit that is basically a 35%-off coupon for the energy they supply, with taxpayers picking up the tab. If coal or nuclear power got a 35% taxpayer subsidy for every kilowatt of electricity they supplied, they would be basking in profits. I helped write and negotiate the just-passed Trump tax bill. When we tried to get rid of the renewable energy tax credit (i.e., create a ""free market in energy""), the green lobby went ballistic and told Republicans this would put much of the industry out of business.For every dollar of subsidy that coal and nuclear power receive, wind power gets almost $5 and solar receives about $20. This does not even include the biggest subsidy of all: About half the states have renewable energy standards requiring utilities to buy 20% to 30% of their power from wind and solar, regardless of the price. What other industry in America has that kind of golden parachute?In terms of assessing the merits of energy alternatives, we ought to have an insurance policy against brownouts and blackouts. Other nations and California have suffered from these because of overdependence on intermittent power sources such as wind and solar. We may regret shutting down reliable nuclear or coal plants, which can't be easily powered up again, during storms, cold winters or hot summer days when we need electricity the most.In the meantime, enough hypocrisy from liberals who lecture us about bailouts and subsidies as if they were Milton Friedman disciples. There is nothing more horrifying to proponents of renewable energy than a genuine free market in energy.Democrats Blast Trump For High Gas Prices … After They Spent Years Trying To Force Them UpDon't Tell Anyone, But We Just Had Two Years Of Record-Breaking Global CoolingCarbon Tax: A Bad Idea Whose Time Should Never Come

135,A,"A mixed week for IBD's Global Leaders list saw some mixed action in the past week, but a promising chart for Atlassian (TEAM).There were some heavy losses among China-based names, with Alibaba Group (BABA), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Huazhu Group (HTHT) carving deep declines as China's domestic markets staged a sharp pullback.At the other end of the spectrum, China-based IPO CLPS (CLPS) spiked about 50% for the week. That left the financial software provider more than 150% above its May 24 IPO price.The list's only other gains for the week came from stocks outside China: Mellanox (MLNX) and Orion Engineered Carbons (OEC). Both are extended from buy points.Among the week's more interesting chart action, software developer Atlassian — headquartered in the U.K. with its operations in Australia — added a tenth week to an unusual base pattern.Atlassian's cloud-based products help direct project-management and team collaboration within large companies and government agencies. IBD Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW) is a key competitor, as are Box (BOX) and the start up Slack. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) entered the market in early 2017 with its own products. It moved more seriously into the space early this month with its $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub.Atlassian has also been an acquirer, paying $425 million for Trello in January last year. Analysts expect to see more deals.Despite the competition, consensus views see Atlassian earnings rising 33% this year and 40% in 2019. Revenue growth is projected at 34% and 30%, respectively, over the same two years.Atlassian shares are up about 42% so far this year. The advance has been saw-toothed, with many highs and lows, including a breakout attempt that failed in February. At the same time, the gains have been loosely cradled by the stock's 10-week moving average.The result sets up the perfect circumstances for an ascending base, considered to be a rare but bullish chart pattern. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.The result is a three-lobe base that forms over a nine-to-16 week period. Each grotto within the base forms higher highs and higher lows. The final high provides the position of the buy point.In Atlassian's case, the base began during the week ended April 20. The buy point is at 68.85. The stock has been trying to clear that entry but fell almost 5% early Friday, testing support at its 10-week moving average before paring losses to around 2%. That left shares down a bit more than 2% for the week.While the base is considered rare, IBD Leaderboard and Global Leaders stock Autohome (ATHM) broke out from an ascending base May 30 with a 107.64 buy point.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.By Thursday, Atlassian's relative strength line had leveled out at new highs. Its Accumulation/Distribution rating was a B-, suggesting institutions were buying moderately.RELATED:Autohome Stock 'Ascends' Into Buy Zone Via This Rare, Bullish BaseHow Atlassian Stacks Up Versus ServiceNow, Microsoft In EnterpriseAtlassian Bulls Focus On Customer Growth, Product InvestmentsInternet Tax Decision, OPEC Worries Spur Selling; Time To Sell Growth Stocks?Trade War Heats Up As EU Tariffs To Kick In: Investing Action Plan

136,A,"When advisors plan a client's financial future, they may assume a steady income stream. But in rare cases, a client stumbles upon an unexpected fortune.Whether they receive a surprise inheritance or hit the jackpot in some other unpredictable twist of fate, individuals can find themselves facing a host of challenges. Advisors step in to provide perspective and sound judgment.To help clients manage unforeseen wealth, advisors wear many hats. Aside from offering tax planning and investment advice, they may serve as a sounding board as clients adjust to a new reality.""Money changes people,"" said Joe Wirbick, a certified financial planner in Lancaster, Pa. ""Their family dynamic changes. Their kids act differently. Their friends act differently. It can get ugly.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOver a decade ago, he worked with a client who won the lottery. The client used some of the money to build his sister a house.Everything started off amicably, but the sister kept expanding the square footage well beyond what they originally agreed. As the construction cost soared, Wirbick's client pulled the plug.This led to a feud, and the siblings stopped speaking to each other.""If you don't earn money slowly over time, you don't know how to handle it when it comes all at once,"" Wirbick said. ""You are not equipped to manage that money.""His client started attending a support group for lottery winners, where they heard cautionary tales of how others had squandered millions. Wirbick recalls that his client couldn't believe that another support group member spent $50,000 on a toilet seat embedded with gold coins.Advisors can play a stabilizing role in keeping their clients grounded after gaining great wealth. That's especially true if they've known the client for years and earned their trust.""I've seen too many people give away their money to their kids or grandkids and, 15 or 20 years later, they may not have enough for themselves,"" Wirbick said.He gives three pieces of advice to those who acquire a huge windfall: It's important to be a good steward of the money, the dollar amount is not as large as it appears on paper, and try not to let everyone know.On a deeper level, advisors strive to enable clients to extract more meaning from their newfound wealth. Doubling as life coaches, they offer guidance on how to harness the money to leave a lasting legacy.Michelle Maton, a Chicago-based certified financial planner, cites a client who sold a painting for vastly more than she paid decades earlier. Maton posed a series of questions such as, ""What have you always wanted to do?"" and ""Who will this impact?""""That clarifies their values,"" Maton said. ""It uncovers what's really important to them. Say their family is really important. They have a choice of buying a fancy car or taking the family on a big vacation every year.""When basking in sudden wealth, clients can look to their advisor to take on a new role as a family mediator. Financial planners often lead meetings to educate family members on the repercussions of having so much money.""With my clients, we discuss what expectations family and friends might impose on them and what expectations they impose on themselves,"" Maton said. ""I tell clients that they can say to their adult children that I've set this rule (about disbursing funds), that they can make me the bad guy.""In addition, advisors can provide a calming influence amid the turbulence that accompanies a planeload of money. Their ability to assess the situation with clear-eyed understanding produces an invaluable benefit.""The first thing we say to a client is, don't do anything until we develop a plan for what the money would be used for,"" said Ryan Dennehy, an advisor in San Ramon, Calif. ""There's no rush. The worst case is to lose it in a casino right away.""From his experience with two clients who hit the jackpot — one in a lottery, the other in a lawsuit award — Dennehy prioritizes debt avoidance. He cautions clients to resist the temptation to finance their high-ticket purchases.""You can buy so much more if you finance it out, but that's what gets people in trouble,"" he said. For newly rich clients, he recommends that they spend $1 million in cash to purchase a home outright than buy five $1 million properties — paying a total of $1 million and borrowing the rest.""Those mortgages stack on top of each other,"" he said.

141,A,"It's tough not to wonder what you might have left on the table when taking profits in that hot stock. But it's better to speculate after the fact, rather than to risk having all of those gains cycle into a loss.Of course, investors hope their latest purchase will double, triple or more in price. And some will, but such big winners are often few and far between.Most stocks will pause to take a breather once they've run up about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to take profits when you're up 20% to 25% on most of your stocks. Even if you don't sell the entire position, it doesn't hurt to lock in some gains.You can then use those winnings to open a position in another stock on your watch list. But what if you're convinced the stock you own isn't ready to slow down?That's why a special hold rule exists. True leaders can sometimes score even bigger gains during a short period. So if a leading stock you own soars 20% or more in less than three weeks from a breakout or a rebound off the 10-week moving average, that warrants holding for eight weeks.When the hold period expires, evaluate the stock to decide if you should sell it or hang on to it for even longer.Whatever you do, don't take what's called a round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout.Let's say stock XYZ, which boasts sound fundamentals across the board, breaks out past a 20.10 cup-base buy point in heavy trade and rises as much as 20% to 24.12 over the next month. You know you should lock in some gains, but think the stock may have more legs, so you stay put.Now XYZ starts to slip. Soon your gain has been whittled down to 18%, then 16%, and so forth. But volume has been light, so you keep holding as the stock nears its 50-day moving average. Then it suddenly slices the key support line and falls below the buy point. You've just taken a full round trip — and it was anything but relaxing.RetailMeNot, which formerly had the ticker symbol ""SALE,"" came public with much fanfare on July 19, 2013, and closed 32% above its 21 offering price the first day. From there it rallied as much as 43% over the next two months before pausing to start its first base.The stock formed a cup-shape base with a 35% correction, on the deep end, but still within normal range. It broke out past a 39.60 buy point the week ended Feb. 14, 2014, in heavy volume (1). RetailMeNot extended its gains, soaring as much as 23% over the next two weeks (2). Such a strong advance normally triggers the eight-week hold rule.But on Feb. 28, 2014, the stock fell 11% in heavy trade, paring its post-breakout gain to 5%. Even though the hold rule was in place, that was an alarming drop. The next week, shares had dipped more than two points below the original 39.60 entry before finding support at the 10-week moving average (3).And by March 11, it closed 17 cents below the buy point (4). Had investors not gotten out by then, they would have suffered a round trip.While the market was in the thick of a bull run, RetailMeNot's fundamentals weren't pristine. Earnings fell 9% and 15% in Q2 and Q3 2013 before rebounding with a 73% gain in the fourth quarter. After-tax profit margins also narrowed during most of those quarterly periods.Then RetailMeNot reported five quarters in a row of falling profits.By February 2016, the stock traded as low as 5.52 a share before getting acquired by Harland Clarke Holdings in May 2017 at $11.60 a share.Editor's Note: A version of this column originally was published in the Sept. 16, 2014, edition of IBD.

144,A,"Cal Turner was raised in Scottsville, Ky., a spit of land roughly 60 miles north of Nashville, 120 miles south of Louisville and home back then to about 2,000 folks. It was the values Turner (1915-2000) learned in this small town that formed him and ultimately led to the creation of the Dollar General. The retail giant now has around 6,000 stores nationwide and annual sales of about $6 billion.According to Cal Turner Jr., who took over the reins of the company from his dad in 1977 and is the author (with Rob Simbeck) of the just-published memoir, ""My Father's Business,"" Turner was convinced that living in a small town made you a better person.""Your behavior and values are different in a small town,"" Turner said in a phone interview. ""Everyone knows you and is keeping an eye on you. Small towns encourage good behavior.""It was ""a vision and value system"" instilled by family patriarch John Luther, a dirt farmer with a third-grade education who actually turned his lack of schooling into a plus. As Turner writes, ""He was convinced that everyone he met was smarter than he (was), and he needed to learn something from each of them.""In 1939 he opened J.L.Turner & Son, Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery. His son Cal did much of the buying. Cal instinctively could pick out merchandise that his retail customers (and, in turn, their customers) would like. He also knew how to strike fair bargains with his suppliers.In his book Cal Jr. quotes Paul Polizzi, a manufacturer's rep, describing Cal Sr.:""He was an outstanding negotiator, but a fair negotiator. He knew the perceived value of a product and what his customers needed and wanted. When he saw a good buy, he jumped right into it.""Junior agrees with that assessment: ""He thrived on negotiating,"" he said. ""He was the quintessential people person.""Vendors loved dealing with him because he paid his bills on time and never sent back returns. That helped him get the best price.Ironically, it was one time that he overbought a product that eventually led to creation of the Dollar General stores. It was a sizable order of ladies' panties that he couldn't unload. He decided that the retailers he was selling to were less of a pipeline to consumers and more of a bottleneck.""We realized you had to go directly to the consumer,"" Cal said. ""We decided we had to have more outlets to get rid of our (buying) mistakes.""Because he knew it well, he decided to serve the value market. He planned to open what he called junior department stores in communities like Scottsville around the South. In these stores, salespeople helped customers and then escorted them to the cash register.And because they knew Cal Sr. well, roughly three dozen merchants became willing partners. The Turners opened stores in Tennessee and Kentucky. They were wholesalers for all the stores. But the stores themselves were 50-50 partnerships.Still, Tuner had definite ideas of how the stores should be run. He insisted they be clean, with all the merchandise displayed. He hated walking into a store and finding goods in the stock room. And he preferred the front doors open, a welcoming sign for potential customers.By the mid-1950s, the stores were grossing $2 million (almost $18.5 million today). Turner was looking for ways to make that number grow further. He became intrigued by Dollar Day specials, a marketing tactic used by several big-city department stores.He figured since the stores were spending a lot of money advertising the specials, they had to be drawing in a sizable number of customers who clearly loved that price point.That's what gave him the idea to open a store where everything always costs $1. It simplified operations and lowered his expenses. His management team told him it wouldn't work. But Turner was a classic entrepreneur who operated from his gut. And his gut told him he was right.The first Dollar General store opened on June 1, 1955. He'd converted an existing store that was failing. In the first 10 months it did $1.1 million in business. Others soon followed.Since this was a new concept, Turner decided to buy out his former store partners. When he first formed the partnership, he understood that for it to work, both partners had to be committed to the stores' success. So he presciently added an intelligent and fair buyout agreement to each contract.If party A wanted out, party B got to name the price for the other half of the business. For example, say B offered $20,000 for A's share. If A thought that was too low — if he felt for that half the business was worth $30,000 — he would immediately be allowed to purchase B's half of the business for $20,000. That way, both parties would be assured that the correct price was offered. No one would underbid knowing he could lose his half of the business.""It was a point of great pride with my dad that while he dissolved all the partnerships, each partner was still his friend,"" Cal Jr. said. ""He attributed that to this agreement.""If Turner made the right call on how to happily dissolve a partnership, he wasn't exactly on target with the everything-for-a-buck concept. That became clear when he sold shoes for $1 each, and people with different size feet left him with unmatched pairs. So, ultimately, he had to abandon the everything-for-a-buck strategy. But everything in the store went for even dollar amounts, and higher-priced items were a step up in value.For example, Turner refused to pay more than a dollar a square foot annually in rent. He didn't care about location. At the low prices he was charging, he understood customers would find him.Turner also paid attention to the tiniest details. Early on, he'd be on the phone with each store manager after closing Saturday night. He needed to know what sold, what didn't and what the cash flow would be the following week.Even as the chain grew and managers sent in paper (or later computer) reports, he might circle a utility bill and send it back asking why a manager was heating the outdoors.He cut expenses where he could. But the bottom line was value for his patrons. One example was his decision to stock irregulars — or slightly flawed — clothing from brand-name manufacturers. He knew Dollar General customers appreciated well-made clothes. And he recognized that an irregular from a good manufacturer was likely better made than the best quality clothing from one not so good.Stonie O'Briant was an executive vice president of Dollar General. He spent about three decades sitting in the office next to Turner's. He saw that Turner was willing to spend money when necessary. The pair would go out on 30, 40 or 50 store visits a year.""If he went into a store that was struggling for whatever reason, he'd encourage the manager to do whatever he thought necessary to make it right, even if it cost a little extra money,"" O'Briant said in a phone interview. ""Sure, he was budget-conscious, but he wanted the manager to know that he had the support he needed.""Asked why he felt Turner was successful, O'Briant summed it up in two words: common sense.""He'd come into my office every morning for about 30 minutes to have a business discussion.""I spent a lot of time in retail, and I pride myself on having a lot of common sense when it comes to people and processes. And he'd come up with ideas, and I'd constantly be asking myself, 'Why didn't I think of that?' ""Founded value chain that became a $6 billion behemoth.Overcame: Discouragement from peers who thought they knew better.Lesson: Go with your gut.Quote: ""If I control my expenses better than the competition, I just have to buy as well as he does and I got him.""

146,A,"Heron Pharmaceuticals (HRTX) presents ""a huge competitive threat"" to Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX), an analyst said Thursday after Heron's painkiller outperformed another in knee replacement and breast-augmentation patients.On the stock market today, Heron rocketed 30.3%, to 40, ending the day at its highest point since September 2015. Pacira tumbled 13.9%, to 34.25. Shares of Alkermes (ALKS), another rival, plunged 15%, to 43.65. Biotech stocks collectively dipped less than 2%.Heron tested its drug, HTX-011, in patients following knee-replacement surgery or breast augmentation. Across the board, HTX-011 and a combination using it proved better at staving off pain than a standard painkiller called bupivacaine.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich argued that puts Pacira's painkiller, Exparel, at risk. Heron has said it will target hospitals and physicians already using Exparel. Later, it will go after those who use bupivacaine.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We continue to view HTX-011, if approved, as a huge competitive threat that is likely to significantly alter the future trajectory for Pacira's Exparel,"" he said in a report.He noted Exparel is difficult to administer. It must be mixed with standard bupivacaine and diluted to fill six separate syringes, all of which are injected multiple times in the case of knee replacement surgery. This requires no fewer than 50 needle sticks, he said.""By comparison, HTX-011 is instilled into the surgical site via a needle-free syringe,"" he said. ""As a result, it is unlikely to require special training to achieve optimal results.""Chief Executive Barry Quart sees reducing opioid use as key to preventing addiction. The firm plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve HTX-011  in the back half of 2018.""With postoperative opioids serving as a gateway to addiction, there is a large unmet need for non-opioid pain alternatives,"" he said in a written statement. Heron now plans to submit its application for approval of HTX-011 in the U.S. in the second half of the year.Heron split knee replacement patients into four groups to test the effects of HTX-011 — alone, in combination with painkiller ropivacaine, bupivacaine by itself and a placebo.In knee replacement patients, the HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone resulted in pain reductions of 23% and 19%, respectively, 48 hours following surgery. The results were nearly double that of bupivacaine, which cut pain by 11% vs. a placebo.At 72 hours following surgery, the combination reduced pain by 22%. HTX-011 cut pain intensity by 19% compared to a placebo. Bupivacaine reduced pain by 11%.Using a more conservative assessment of pain, the combination and HTX-011 cut pain by a respective 16% and 12% at 48 hours vs. a placebo. Bupivacaine resulted in a 4% cut. At 72 hours, the combination and HTX-011 cut pain by 15% and 11%, respectively.Researchers tested HTX-011 as a nerve block — injecting it near key nerves — at three doses in breast augmentation. They tested bupivacaine and a placebo. Another study compared HTX-011 as an instillation — administered drop by drop — vs. a nerve block.A day after undergoing breast augmentation, patients experienced 22% reductions in pain intensity after receiving 400-milligram doses of HTX-011 as either a nerve block or by instillation. Bupivacaine as a nerve block resulted in an 8% reduction.With a more conservative measure of pain, HTX-011 by instillation cut pain by 24% a day after surgery. As a nerve block, it reduced pain intensity by 23%. A nerve block of bupivacaine resulted in a 12% reduction.HTX-011 as a 400-milligram instillation was effective in reducing opioid use by 33%. As a nerve block it reduced the need for opioids by 26% compared to a placebo. Bupivacaine as a nerve block resulted in a 10% reduction.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFs

147,A,"A quiet sea change is underway in U.S. defense procurement, one that has vast implications for innovative tech firms around the country.For the first time in a long time, the Pentagon is seeking to aggressively tap the expertise of companies well outside the circle of contractors that have provided the technological advantage to America's military.This effort is driven by the understanding that in an era of rapid technological change, some of the greatest advances that would benefit the armed forces are occurring in the commercial sector. The stepped-up interest is a potential benefit to the bottom line for thousands of U.S. companies that might not have otherwise considered the Defense Department a viable market.The allure of nondefense companies is not new. Defense and Congress every few years call for greater use of commercial capabilities. But the extent of the renewed vigor is sky-high, coming from both ends of Pennsylvania Ave. — from a White House intent on cutting regulations and a Congress intent on reforming Pentagon procurement.It is underpinned by a congressionally mandated panel of contracting experts that examined how to make the military's vast and glacial procurement system more effective and efficient. The experts reported back last year, telling lawmakers that the traditional coterie of defense companies is no longer sufficient to keep the U.S. in the technological lead when facing potential enemies.""The defense industrial base has changed, and to maintain technological advantage, DoD increasingly must leverage the commercial marketplace. To be successful in this broader marketplace requires a fundamental change in the DoD-commercial relationship. DoD must become an attractive customer with which commercial firms want to do business,"" they wrote.The press for widening the circle of defense companies comes at a critical period for the U.S. military — as it is facing dramatically rising threats from Russia and China, two nations with a voracious appetite for new technology and that cast a wide net for any advantage.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The competitive military advantage we enjoy today is the result of capabilities developed by our services in an era of unchallenged technological dominance. That era has now passed,"" Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told a congressional panel in May.To reach companies that don't typically do business with the Department of Defense, the Pentagon is turning to a funding mechanism known as ""Other Transaction Authority,"" or OTA.OTA is designed to jump-start the slow technology-buying process and rapidly develop prototypes for assessment by the military services. The speed is generated by slashing the Pentagon's legendary red tape, and efficiency is gained by testing technology before buying it. OTA projects provide greater flexibility than typical government procurements, and they are very welcoming of companies that have no history working with the Department of Defense. A research and prototyping project can be shepherded through the acquisition process and funded in about two months, where it could take well over a year if managed through the usual wickets.Use of OTA in the Department of Defense has increased fivefold since 2012, says Stan Soloway, a former deputy undersecretary for defense, from $400 million to approximately $2 billion last year. The current year is expected to continue that upward trend.While still a drop in the bucket compared with the annual Pentagon budget of approximately $700 billion, the increasing reliance on OTA highlights its value for a military eager to mine the full spectrum of the commercial sector.So how to best employ the OTA mechanism? An important aspect is having the armed forces look well beyond Silicon Valley to other technology centers in the U.S.That's a key reason why the U.S. Army, for example, in search of simulation, gaming and augmented-reality/virtual-reality systems to improve its training of soldiers, recently held an industry day in Austin, Texas. The event attracted nontraditional defense companies, large and small. They ranged from sizable companies such as Dell and Accenture, to small Austin-area startups such as Offworld Industries and iTexico.A second aspect is creating the right environment to bridge the cultural gap between the public and private sectors. The Defense Department can bring new meaning to the word ""byzantine."" So companies with innovative technology that have never before worked with the armed services require mentorship to ensure the partnership is fruitful. The goal should be to make the partnership easy for the innovator and the contracting office, while boosting the capabilities of U.S. forces as rapidly as practical.Potential adversaries have greater access to emerging commercial technologies than ever before, posing a serious threat to national security. OTA will allow the U.S. to tap the technological prowess of U.S. commercial firms, while making Pentagon procurement reform a reality.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

148,A,"When he was asked how to become a columnist, Charles Krauthammer would say, with characteristic drollery, ""First, you go to medical school."" He did, with psychiatry as his specialty because, he said with characteristic felicity, it combined the practicality of medicine and the elegance of philosophy. But he also came to the columnist craft by accident. Because of one.It has been said that if we had to think about tying our shoes or combing our hair we would never get out of the house in the morning. Life is mostly habitual — do you actually remember any details of driving home last evening? The more of life's functions that are routinely performed without thinking, the more thinking we can do. That, however, is not how life was for Charles after his accident.In 1972, when he was a 22-year-old student at Harvard Medical School, he was swimming in a pool. Someone pushed the diving board out, extending over a shallower part of the pool. Charles, not realizing this, dove and broke his neck. At the bottom of the pool, ""I knew exactly what happened. I knew why I wasn't able to move, and I knew what that meant."" It meant that life was going to be different than he and Robyn had anticipated when they met at Oxford.He left two books at the pool. One was a text on the spinal cord. The other was Andre Malraux's novel ""Man's Fate.""You can read past Charles Krauthammer published by IBD here.Paralyzed from the neck down, he completed medical school, did an internship and, one thing leading to another, as life has a way of doing, became not a jewel in the crown of the medical profession, which he would have been, but one of America's foremost public intellectuals. Nothing against doctors, but the nation needed Charles more as a diagnostician of our public discontents.During the 1980 presidential campaign, Charles wrote speeches for the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Walter Mondale, who did not realize — neither did Charles — that the campaign harbored a thinker who soon would be a leading light of contemporary conservatism. Dictating columns when not driving himself around Washington in a specially designed van that he operated while seated in his motorized wheelchair, crisscrossing the country to deliver speeches to enthralled audiences, Charles drew on reserves of energy and willpower to overcome a multitude of daily challenges, any one of which would cause most people to curl up in a fetal position. Fortunately, with more brain cells to spare than the rest us have to use, he could think about doing what was no longer habitual, and about national matters, too.Charles died at 68, as did, 19 years ago, Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page. For many years, Meg, Charles and this columnist met for Saturday lunches with a guest — usually someone then newsworthy; now completely forgotten — at a Washington greasy spoon whose name, the Chevy Chase Lounge, was grander than the place. Like Meg, Charles was one of those vanishingly rare Washingtonians who could be both likable and logical. This is not easy in a town where the local industry, politics — unlike, say, engineering; get things wrong and the bridges buckle — thrives on unrefuted errors.Medicine made Charles intimate with finitude — the skull beneath the skin of life; the fact that expiration is written into the lease we have on our bodies. And his accident gave him a capacity for sympathy, as Rick Ankiel knows.Ankiel was a can't-miss, Cooperstown-bound pitching phenomenon for the St. Louis Cardinals — until, suddenly and inexplicably, he could not find the plate. Starting the opening game of a playoff series at age 21, the prodigy threw five wild pitches and his career rapidly spiraled far down to ... resurrection as a 28-year-old major league outfielder, for a short but satisfying stint in defiance of F. Scott Fitzgerald's dictum that there are no second acts in a life. As Charles wrote, Ankiel's saga illustrated ""the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.""The health problems that would end Charles' life removed him from the national conversation nine months ago, so his legion of admirers already know that he validated this axiom: Some people are such a large presence while living that they still occupy space even when they are gone.Other columns by George Will

151,A,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) likely will seek a buyer after its Amgen (AMGN)-rivaling preventative migraine treatment gets approval, an analyst said Thursday as shares tanked on the hire of a new chief executive.Alder shares dropped 1.9% to 17.80 on the stock market today. Shares broke out of a cup base at an 18.70 buy point earlier in the week. But the rally was short-lived as the stock sank for three consecutive days.The biotech company hired Robert Azelby, former chief commercial officer at Juno Therapeutics, as its new chief executive. Celgene (CELG) recently acquired Juno, an immuno-oncology player. Before that, Azelby worked at Amgen where he managed the U.S. oncology business.But Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees Azelby's tenure as likely a short one.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The advantages of Mr. Azelby, in our view, are locality and availability, since he was already in Seattle and had presumably become available after the acquisition of Juno by Celgene,"" he said in a report to clients.He added: ""It's hard to believe that the board views Mr. Azelby as the long-term leader for this company, and the appointment adds to our conviction that the board will ultimately support a sale.""A sale is unlikely however until Alder gets approval for its preventative migraine treatment, known as a CGRP inhibitor. Amgen gained approval for its drug, Aimovig, in May. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are also working on similar drugs.Earlier this year, Alder's founder and former CEO Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down. Alder had planned to submit its application for its migraine treatment in the second half of the year. Now, it expects to submit an application in the first quarter of 2019.The fact that Alder hired a new CEO isn't surprising, Porges said. ""But it is something of a surprise that the individual appointed to the position has no experience in neurology, and has not previously overseen the complex multi-functional elements of a product introduction,"" he said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams, on the other hand, called the hire a ""sensible fit"" as Alder moves toward its commercial stage. Azelby brings significant experience in commercial strategy across large and small biotechs, and biopharma, he said.""We believe all of this will be important in launching (preventative migraine treatment) eptinezumab,"" he said in a note. ""We understand he has also been closely involved in regulatory processes at his prior organizations, experience which can help with eptinezumab's (application) filing.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

156,A,"Fidelity Investments has long been known for its top-performing portfolio managers like Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan Fund (FMAGX) and Will Danoff of Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).But in recent years, the Boston-based fund giant has increasingly focused on building a name for itself in the universe of exchange traded funds. In 2003, it launched its first ETF, Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking Stock Fund (ONEQ). Since Greg Friedman came on board in 2013 as head of ETF management and strategy, Fidelity has really beefed up its offerings.With its Thursday launch of two factor-based funds in the fixed-income space, Fidelity now has 10 factor ETFs in its lineup. It launched six domestic factor ETFs in September 2016 and added two international factor ETFs in January 2018. The two new funds, Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor (FLDR) and Fidelity High Yield Factor (FDHY), target the fixed-income space.""With a quantitative, rules-based methodology at its core and an active liquidity overlay, Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF leverages our extensive high-income capabilities to offer an enhanced exposure to the high-yield market for ETF investors,"" Friedman said in a statement. ""Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF is unique in its category because it seeks a balance between credit risk and interest rate risk, on top of pursuing higher income potential than a money market with lower volatility than a short-term bond fund.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity now offers 25 ETFs in its lineup, including the 10 factor ETFs mentioned above, three actively managed bond ETFs and 11 passive equity-sector ETFs. It also offers investors access to 70 passive iShares ETFs. Fidelity has more than $11 billion in ETF assets under management. Its ETF assets under administration is more than $380 billion.IBD touched base with Friedman to learn more about Fidelity's new funds, as well as what trends the mutual fund and ETF provider is seeing in exchange traded funds. The full interview with Friedman, previously an ETF product management executive at iShares and Russell, follows:IBD: Why did Fidelity start offering ETFs?Fidelity entered the ETF market with one of our biggest differentiators — distribution power. Today, we combine the power of our distribution capability with our asset management capabilities. Investors and advisors on our brokerage platform can access a broad range of industry-leading ETFs commission-free. Where we manufacture is in the active and smart-beta areas, where we are confident we can innovate and deliver real value for our customers.IBD: Do you think the ETFs have been taking some inflow (or interest) away from Fidelity's mutual funds?Friedman: Mutual funds and ETFs do not need to be an either/or proposition. Many investors and advisors use both to help meet their financial goals. A good example is our sector lineup, which includes sector mutual funds and ETFs. Since launching the sector ETF lineup in 2013, one of the widest sector offerings in the industry, we have seen assets grow in both areas.IBD: What sets Fidelity's ETFs apart from the competition?Friedman: We seek to bring the best of Fidelity and a strong value to our clients in our ETF offerings. More than 90 ETFs are available commission-free on our brokerage platform. We bring Fidelity's world-class investment insights to market through our active bond ETFs and our equity factor ETFs. Lastly, we also offer some of the lowest-cost passive sector ETFs in the industry.IBD: Which ETFs have seen the biggest inflows this year?Friedman: Our low-cost sector ETF offering has been seeing the most flows, and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF (FTEC) has gained nearly $500 million in assets thus far in 2018. But we've also seen interest in our income-oriented ETFs, such as Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR) and Fidelity Total Bond ETF (FBND).IBD: What are some of your biggest and best-performing ETFs over the past three to five years?Friedman: Our largest fund is Fidelity MSCI Information Technology, with over $2 billion in assets. Our next three largest funds are Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index (FHLC), Fidelity MSCI Financial Index (FNCL), and Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index (ONEQ). All these funds are over $1 billion in assets. For the three-year period, three of our best performing funds were FTEC (18.2%), FNCL (14.3%) and ONEQ (13.8%).IBD: Factor-based funds (smart beta) have been popular among investors. Do you think that's still the case?Friedman: Yes, clients use factor-based funds strategically as well as tactically to solve for investment needs. We see people using factor-based strategies in a few different ways. The most obvious is to generate strong returns. Strategies such as value, quality and momentum have historically produced strong performance. Another is to manage risk with a low-volatility strategy. Additionally, someone might be looking to achieve a specific outcome, such as generating higher dividend income. IBD: Fidelity last week launched two new factor-based bond funds — FLDR and FDHY. Could you tell us more about each fund and why Fidelity decided to roll them out?Friedman: Sure, I'm really excited about these new ETFs. To answer the why, we are constantly evaluating our ETF product offerings and soliciting feedback from our customers to ensure we're meeting their needs, particularly in areas where we can innovate. We've received strong interest from our customers for fixed-income factor strategies. This led us to create two new ETFs that are different from what's currently in the market, Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF and Fidelity Low Duration Bond ETF.The Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF leverages Fidelity's high-income capabilities to bring innovation to the high-yield-ETF space because it has a quantitative, rules-based methodology at its core and an active liquidity overlay. Fidelity Low Duration Bond ETF is also unique in that it seeks a balance between credit risk and interest-rate risk, on top of pursuing higher income potential than a money market with lower volatility than a short-term bond fund.IBD: Are there any particular trends you're seeing currently in the ETF space (sector, style, etc.)?Friedman: We are seeing a continuation of growth in factor and smart-beta investing. In addition, ETFs continue to be used as core positions in model strategies. We also see the industry anticipating development of active equity ETFs.IBD: Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates comes to mind as a potential rising-rate play. Could you please explain FDRR's investment strategy?Friedman: Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates targets high-dividend-paying stocks while trying to mitigate the effect rising interest rates often have on other dividend ETFs. That happens through two pieces of the index methodology. First is that in addition to dividend yield, payout ratio and dividend growth, we include the stock's correlation to 10-year Treasuries in the stock ranking process. Second is its sector composition. Many dividend-focused funds and ETFs have high exposure to historically interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities and REITs. By keeping sector weightings similar to the broader market, it should avoid overexposure to those rate-sensitive sectors.IBD: Anything else about Fidelity's ETFs you'd like our readers to know?Friedman: We are committed to bringing the best of Fidelity to ETF form, by delivering choice, value and innovation to our clients.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:From AI To Social Media And Beyond, This ETF Pioneer DeliversChina, Solar Among Hot Stock Picks As S&P 500 Targets 3000AI-Powered Stock Picks, Internet Giants Among New ETF Launches

161,A,"Discipline and persistence are keys to learning leadership skills. That, says Martin Lanik, CEO of Denver-based leadership development firm Pinsight, is because he sees it as vital for leaders to practice those skills, just as an athlete or musician would.Here's how to do it.Rote is right. Lanik, author of ""The Leader Habit,"" tells leaders to identify the traits and characteristics they need to be successful and then constantly work at aspects of them.""Do it so often that you don't think about it,"" Lanik told IBD. ""Make it like your morning routine.""Take small steps. It'll take too long if a leader focuses on a big task, Lanik says. Break it down into pieces so you can focus on one thing and make it a habit. Say you want to get better at delegating tasks. Rather than focus on that broad goal, start with one aspect, such as confirming that the person to whom you're delegating actually wants to do it.""Ask as you're delegating if that's something the person would like to do,"" Lanik said. ""If you keep practicing that, after a couple of months it'll become automatic.""Win faith. It's vital for the leader to be disciplined because that consistency creates stability that shows the team members they can believe in the person at the top.""Then there's a lot of pride and trust in the leader,"" said Bette Price, who runs the Price Group, her Dallas-based management consulting firm.Find opportunity. Persistence is vital because problems are always going to pop up. Things rarely go the way you planned. Take the attitude that you won't give up, Price says.""See obstacles as steppingstones,"" Price said. ""It's the old idea of either earn or learn. Obstacles are an inherent, realistic part of business.""Make less effort. You probably want to try harder, but Lanik gives the opposite advice. Practice traits that aren't as complex and that are achievable.""You can be persistent by minimizing effort,"" Lanik said. ""Cramming behaviors into a day is not sustainable. Keep it simple and focus on one step at a time. That's actually sustainable.""Focus on your strengths. You're better off paying attention to improving areas where you have natural talent, Lanik says. If you're an introvert, it'll take so much energy and effort to force yourself to do public speaking that it's unlikely you'll become successful at it. Instead, replace it with something you have a knack for, such as active listening.""You can fake that you like it and learn to do anything,"" Lanik said. ""But is the time and effort you put into it worth what you'll get out of it?""Stay positive. Avoid negative people. They're never going to overcome problems, Price says. Get people with a can-do attitude who can get past challenges.""No leader can do it alone,"" Price said. ""You have to trust your team.""Seek input. Don't just look for help from your executive team when trying to bring discipline and perseverance to the company's culture. Listen to all of your people. The best ideas often come from front-line workers.""They know that whatever part they play, they'll feel involved,"" Price said.Make end results clear. When people know how important their role is, they'll have a stronger sense of purpose, Price says. As she's researched millennials she found one person who had to compile papers for a presentation. It seemed like a menial task but he later found out it was for the sales team trying to close a big deal.""He said if he knew that he would've felt important,"" Price said.Track progress. Gauge how you're progressing in hitting your leadership practice goals.""Think about leadership development as a continuous process and have a system that keeps people accountable,"" Lanik said.

162,A,"You can take this to the bank: Millennials are optimistic about how to become rich. Exhibit A? Fifty-three percent of millennials expect to become a millionaire — or are one already. That self-confidence about how to become rich is even more pronounced among male millennials. An astounding 73% of them expect to become millionaires or already have reached that goal. Still, there's nothing wrong with aiming high. So the key question is, How can millennials achieve their aim of amassing $1 million?Experts do in fact offer roadmaps for how to become rich. One way that millennials — who range from 21 to 37 years of age, brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) says — can build their wealth is by investing in assets that grow — not just park them in a piggy bank, where they do nothing. Another step millennials should take, one expert says, is to limit how much advice they take from the, you know, ""experts.""""You can learn a lot from your peers, not just from older 'experts',"" said Ian Rosen, CEO of StockTwits, an online community of nearly 2 million investors and traders, the bulk of whom are millennials. StockTwits members help educate each other by sharing more than 200,000 messages per day about markets and investing.Rosen says that many millennials are jaded about so-called experts, who were the high priests of the financial industry and nearly broke the global economy during the Great Recession, enriching themselves while financially hurting millennials' parents and grandparents.

Also, pay down the balance on whichever credit card charges the highest interest. And if you pay off debt in minimum monthly installments, be sure to pay down principal as well as interest so that you eventually get rid of the balance.Yet 50% of millennials don't invest in the stock market. ""Many millennials don't realize that investing in an equity mutual fund means you're investing in stocks,"" Kinahan said. ""And broad ETFs and mutual funds are a good way to start.

163,A,"Sector Leader Netflix surged 3.5% Tuesday as markets and two of its three FANG stock tech peers lost ground. The impetus came from three analysts' reports.GBH analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target on Netflix (NFLX) by 25% to 500. The note said a GBH survey determined that Netflix subscribers, on average, use the streaming entertainment service about 10 hours per week. That was about double the amount of time spent by Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu subscribers spent on those services.(Hulu is a joint venture between Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOX), Comcast (CMCSA), and AT&T (T).)Ives also cited Netflix' strong positioning in terms of content and distribution growth. And overseas opportunities point the service toward what he projects will be a 700 million subscriber base by 2020.A note from Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White raised Netflix' price target to 460, from 375, and kept a buy rating on the stock. At Piper Jaffray, Michael Olson ramped up his price target 14%, to 420, and maintained his overweight rating.Netflix — also an IBD Leaderboard name — is hammering out new highs as it works on its fifth straight weekly advance ahead of its second-quarter report. The stock is extended after breakouts in January and May, and approaching a profit-taking zone.The stock is up 95% above the 204.48 buy point in January's flat base.Netflix had already broken out when it spiked nearly 10% on Jan. 23. The company had just reported meeting analysts' fourth-quarter earnings targets, and slightly beating Q4 revenue views. Subscriber growth, however, blew past expectations, rising to 8.33 million, vs. guidance for 6.3 million.Shares bolted 9% higher on April 17, the session following its late day quarterly report. Shares then pulled back over the next six sessions, settling firmly in a test of support at their 10-week moving average. That consolidation became a new flat base with a 338.92 buy point.Netflix cleared that buy point in meager trade on May 23. That was the day after the company reported signing former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama to a multiyear deal as film and series producers.Trading volume kicked in during the following session to verify the breakout. The stock on Tuesday was up 19.5% from that buy point. The stock will hit a 20% profit-taking zone beyond 406.70. A rise to 423.65 would spell a 25% profit.Analyst consensus projects a 433% gain in earnings to 80 cents a share for Netflix' second quarter. The company targets a 6.2 million increase in its subscriber base during the quarter, to 131.2 million. The company reports after the market closes on July 16.Among Netflix' FANG stock peers, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) both fell 0.4% on Tuesday, and Amazon.com (AMZN) erased early losses to rally 0.6% for its fifth advance in six trading days.RELATED:These 3 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy Range Right NowNetflix Stock Jumps On Big Increase In New SubscribersNetflix Stock Spikes To Record High As Investors Ignore Short-Seller Call

164,A,"Six months into the year, the performance of the current stocks in the IBD 50 looks good. Surprisingly good. Yet some stocks are naturally forming new bases.Among the companies that made the list after Thursday's market close, the average year-to-date advance stands at a stout 42%. Either way you cut it, the performance is oodles of times more than the 2.2% lift by the S&P 500, excluding dividends. Through Friday's morning trade, the Nasdaq composite reached 7672, up 11% since Jan. 1.However, no one knows what the next six months will bring. So it makes complete sense to gauge the health of the market on a day-to-day basis. Do it in three steps. One, track the major indexes. The Big Picture column helps immensely in this corner.Two, watch the action of the IBD 50. And three, closely observe the action in your own portfolio. If you're picking top-rated companies, you have insight into how the market leadership is acting.Currently, 13 stocks are trading 10% or more below their 52-week or all-time highs. The median correction within the IBD 50: a delightfully mild 5.5% from the 52-week peak.ZTO Express (ZTO) is about 9% below a 21.70 all-time high. As seen on a weekly chart, the midcap transport stock is working to keep above the rising 10-week moving average. Would a small dip below the 10-week line be reasonable? Yes, because the stock had performed admirably after a breakout past a proper entry point at 17.57 on May 14. After clearing the base, which has features of a double bottom, ZTO rolled ahead with a 23% gain.It's smart to take gains in most stocks when they build a profit of 20% to 25% from the breakout point, as ZTO shows.ZTO, a delivery giant and e-commerce play in China, joined IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday. It is forming a base with a 21.80 buy point.Canada Goose (GOOS) is trading about 14% below an all-time peak of 68.75. But in late June, the stock sank as much as 19% below that high. That means the current correction would be too deep for a flat base.The only stock within the IBD 50 that sits more than 20% off its high: Israel's SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). At a June 18 short-term low of 45.85, it's fallen more than 35% off its 70.74 peak. The solar inverter firm has now spent more than four weeks below the 10-week moving average, yet has not challenged the 40-week line (equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart).An escalating global trade war with the U.S. would likely impact the future growth of some IBD 50 firms. Baozun (BZUN), which promotes e-commerce in the Middle Kingdom for non-Chinese exporters, certainly carries more trade-related risk than, say, HealthEquity (HQY), the expert in health savings accounts in the U.S.Digital economy plays seem more immune to the tit-for-tat tariffs. After all, you're not going to find Netflix (NFLX) ""products"" on some container ship heading to Shanghai or Shenzhen. The online streaming video innovator is taking full advantage of broadband internet technology in its quest to bring fresh entertainment to subscribers all over the world.Canada Goose's products are gaining traction through the DTC (direct to consumer) channel. According to a 20-F filing to the SEC, the luxury cold weather apparel firm opened e-commerce stores in Canada, the U.S., U.K. and France from 2013 to 2016. On the brick-and-mortar front, the company has so far focused its investments in the cities of New York, London, Paris, Milan and Tokyo.You can trade the IBD 50 with just one transaction with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

167,A,"Congress created the usual special interest frenzy with its latest iteration of the Farm Bill. Agricultural subsidies are one of the most important examples of corporate welfare, money handed out to businesses based on political connections.Business plays a vital role in a free market. In real capitalism there are no guaranteed profits. But corporate welfare eliminates this handicap for the well-connected.Business subsidies that allow politicians to channel economic resources toward their preferred ends distort investment and trade. Moreover, turning government into an engine of illicit profit encourages what economists call rent-seeking. Well-organized special interests usually triumph over the broader public and national interest.Aid comes in many forms.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAgriculture has spawned a gaggle of sometimes bizarre subsidies. Like a dairy program which created milk surpluses, in turn encouraging state price fixing, generating massive cheese stockpiles, in turn triggering giveaways to the poor. Payments, loans, crop insurance, import quotas, and more underwrite farmers.Money also goes to agricultural enterprises through the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, which supports ""business development."" The recently defeated Farm Bill even included $65 million in special health care subsidies for agricultural associations. Ironically, farm households enjoy higher median income and wealth than non-farm households.The Market Access Program is one of several initiatives to subsidize agricultural exports. Other programs support general trade and investment.For instance, the Export-Import Bank is known as Boeing's Bank. It provides cheap credit for foreign buyers of American products. Which, ironically, gives foreign firms an advantage over U.S. producers who must pay full fare. Ex-Im's biggest beneficiary in recent years has been China, especially its state-owned firms.The Overseas Private Investment Corporation underwrites U.S. investment in potentially unstable nations. If the project pays off, investors win. If not, the rest of us lose. Why should the public guarantee investor profits?At the other end of the commercial spectrum is the Small Business Administration. Smaller firms are a vital part of the American economy but they are not an underserved market. There is no dearth of, say, liquor stores. SBA is a response to a political opportunity, not an economic need.Much corporate welfare is disguised in broader terms. The Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration subsidizes ""development"" in ""distressed communities,"" meaning the agency underwrites business, with dubious results. There are some 180 federal pork barrel ""economic development"" programs.The Rural Utilities Service (formerly the Rural Electrification Administration), continues, never mind that rural America got electricity decades ago. Today RUS has expanded into Broadband internet and even television service.The Bureau of Land Management (mis)manages federal lands, subsidizing use of rangeland by ranchers, for instance. There are incentives for airline companies to serve small markets. Foreign Military Financing is presented as a national defense measure, but in most cases the chief beneficiaries are arms makers.Housing subsidies are many, most notably mortgage support and tax preferences, though the latter was trimmed by last year's tax bill. The Trump administration is pushing subsidies for what the president calls ""beautiful"" coal power plants.Federal research and development offers bountiful benefits to business. The more basic the R&D, the better the argument that the public interest is being served. The closer to commercialization, the more the expenditures are essentially corporate welfare.For example, the Obama administration funneled $535 million worth of loan guarantees to Solyndra, which President Barack Obama called an ""engine of economic growth."" The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011.The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program provides $25 billion in loans for development of cars powered by alternative fuels. Tesla is a major beneficiary. Some firms enjoy multiple benefits.Although most public attention falls on direct expenditures, trade ""protection"" is no less a form of corporate welfare. Both tariffs and quotas allow domestic manufacturers to charge more. Tariffs and other fees alone come to around $40 billion a year.Tax preferences are another means of corporate welfare. Buried in the tax code, they often are difficult to identify, Measures which affect only one firm or industry, in contrast to those with general economic impact, should be treated as subsidies. The Tax Foundation once figured ""special tax provisions"" to cost more than $100 billion annually in lost revenue.States and localities also offer subsidies, many through grants, free property, and tax preferences to attract businesses to a particular area. Estimates of these costs run between around $50 billion and $80 billion.Few in Washington really want to cut spending. But ending corporate welfare would be a start to restoring fiscal sanity in Washington.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

It hit an all-time high of 182.45 on June 22.Spotify will have a hard time differentiating itself from rivals such as Apple (AAPL) Music because it offers the same catalog of songs, Helfstein said.

They, along with Merlin, a representative of many independent labels, control access to most music today with a catalog of 35 million tracks.Spotify is the leader in subscription-streaming music services today, but the relationship between scale and success is not as well defined in the sector as it is in other internet businesses, he said.Scale has translated to market dominance for firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Airbnb, he said.""Their leadership is a positive feedback loop as content/product availability increases proportionally to consumer demand,"" Helfstein said. ""We see no such force in music streaming because supply has no relationship to demand.""The music streaming market ultimately will be shared by a few scaled players, he said.

171,A,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

175,A,"Holding through a stock's significant decline that could lead to a new potential base is a challenging prospect. Who wants to sit through a potential 15% or 20% drawdown for an indeterminate period of time with virtually nothing but a belief that the stock will head higher? Yet that is one way to make long-term outstanding gains with true leaders in a healthy stock market.Let's take a look at PayPal (PYPL), which had a big move from its first-stage base in late April 2017 until its sell-off in the first two weeks of February this year.The stock moved sharply above its first buy point — a shallow six-month cup with handle with a 43.90 entry — on April 24, 2017, just days ahead of the company's quarterly results. A strong first-quarter report sent the stock soaring more than 6% on April 27; volume surged 459% above its 50-day average.At least four aspects factor into a decision to hold a stock long-term.First and foremost is the stock's fundamental story. PayPal has become a household name; users ""venmo"" each other money. Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases and has become one of PayPal's strongest-growing services.Second, check out the company's quarterly earnings and sales. PayPal has recently posted five quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. Accelerating growth means that earnings showed a larger percentage gain in the latest quarter than in the prior quarter. At least two quarters of accelerating earnings growth is a bullish fundamental metric shared by many of the stock market's big winners. IBD Stock Checkup shows the number of quarters of accelerating EPS growth for every stock.Third, a nice profit cushion is a requisite for holding a stock. A flat base can correct up to 15% and still be proper. Meanwhile, the math off the top can be brutal. A 15% decline erases an almost 18% profit, so starting off with a greater than 20% gain is a solid idea.Finally, patience is the last necessary quality, and only when the market is in a solid uptrend. Letting a stock idea bake requires the ability to focus on the macro picture and not the daily price swings from high to low.Remember, weekly charts — found on IBD and MarketSmith — come first. It's easy to lose your way in the daily volatility of a stock's action, and the weekly chart smooths out that choppiness. A simple longer-term sell rule is the first significant close below the 10-week line (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart). Leading stocks can go months, even years, without taking out that institutional support level.Even when PayPal built a 13.6%-deep flat base at the end of 2017, the 10-week line guided the stock higher. The new base featured a 79.48 buy point, 10 cents above the left-side high.In the week ended Feb. 2 this year, PayPal plunged through its 10-week line, closing down over 10% on the week in volume surging 105% above the 10-week average. It was the stock's first significant close below that level since the start of its move back in April, over nine months ago. On Feb. 6, PayPal fell more than 7% below the latest buy point, triggering a key loss-cutting sell rule. Driving the stock lower was news that its former parent, eBay (EBAY), would be ending their relationship by switching to a new digital payments provider.While that seems like a big giveback off the top, even selling at the Feb. 6 session low of 72.25 still captures a gain of at least 64% from the early cup-with-handle buy point of 43.90, while giving the stock room for an ever bigger move to the upside. You have to be willing to sacrifice a portion of your profit for greater potential upside, which underscores the importance of maintaining a lower-cost basis.It's great to have conviction, but only as long as the stock is going up. Remember, while buying a stock is primarily driven by its fundamentals, selling a stock is most definitively based on the chart. When it starts to trigger classic sell signals, it's time to listen to the stock and lock in hard-fought gains, especially when the market environment is falling apart.If the market regains its stride and the stock constructively builds a new base, you can always buy the stock back at a new risk-optimal buy point.(A version of this article was first published on Feb. 9, 2018.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

178,A,"A Wall Street analyst on Tuesday initiated coverage of Spotify Technology (SPOT) with the equivalent of a neutral rating, saying the streaming music leader has limited upside.Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein started Spotify at a perform rating and estimated that the stock has a value range of 160 to 170. Spotify stock rose 1.7% to 180.43 on the stock market today.Spotify went public on April 3, ending its first day at 149.01. It hit an all-time high of 182.45 on June 22.Spotify will have a hard time differentiating itself from rivals such as Apple (AAPL) Music because it offers the same catalog of songs, Helfstein said. It also has limited leverage with the music labels to negotiate for better terms that could improve its profitability, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe big three music labels are Vivendi's (VIVHY) Universal Music Group, the Sony Music Entertainment division of Japanese conglomerate Sony (SNE), and Warner Music Group, a division of privately held Access Industries. They, along with Merlin, a representative of many independent labels, control access to most music today with a catalog of 35 million tracks.Spotify is the leader in subscription-streaming music services today, but the relationship between scale and success is not as well defined in the sector as it is in other internet businesses, he said.Scale has translated to market dominance for firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Airbnb, he said.""Their leadership is a positive feedback loop as content/product availability increases proportionally to consumer demand,"" Helfstein said. ""We see no such force in music streaming because supply has no relationship to demand.""The music streaming market ultimately will be shared by a few scaled players, he said. Some like Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have other businesses that can create cross-selling opportunities using music services.Spotify ended the March quarter with 75 million paying subscribers. It also had 99 million monthly active users of its free, ad-supported service in the first quarter.Oppenheimer predicts that Spotify can reach 218 million paying subscribers by 2024.

""However, to ensure the best onboard experience for everyone, especially for customers with peanut-related allergies, we've made the difficult decision to discontinue serving peanuts on all flights beginning Aug. 1.""""Our ultimate goal is to create an environment where all customers — including those with peanut-related allergies — feel safe and welcome on every Southwest flight,"" the statement continued.An airline spokesperson told IBD that the end of peanut service will be permanent.Southwest will continue to serve free pretzels, along with its ""wonderful portfolio of free snacks on longer flights."" The carrier said it hoped those offerings ""will please customers who might be nostalgic or sad to see peanuts go.""The carrier will join United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in not serving peanuts aboard flights. United, on its website, warns that it is ""not possible to prevent customers from bringing food items on board that contain major food allergens including peanuts.""Southwest edged down 0.5% in the stock market today, still above its 50-day line. United dipped 0.7%, while American lost 0.5%. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q2 earnings Thursday, rose 0.2%.Southwest's passenger traffic rose 2.6% in June.

181,A,"Like any other stocks, a bank stock that falls into a long decline tends to eventually rise and emerge as a new market leader. When it does, investors are looking for ways to buy into the recovery.Investor's Business Daily's discussion of CAN SLIM strategies largely involves chart patterns that range from as few as five weeks to several months. Company turnarounds and industry cycles tend to take longer than this. As a result, some base patterns can stretch into months and years.A saucer base is a chart pattern that sometimes forms in just a few months. Mastercard's (MA) action in April to September of 2016 is one good example.But this base often requires one or two years to mature. This kind of ""geological pace"" seriously tests the attention span of modern investors, many of whom seek constant motion, or otherwise move on.Saucer bases are sometimes shallow, even below the 15% level that determines a flat base. But they tend to always appear shallow. This is due to their length. A cup base that is 35% deep and eight weeks long can look quite severe.But spread that 35% correction out over a year, and it looks like a saucer, not a cup.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJPMorgan Chase (JPM) dug a saucer base that was 29% deep between April 2015 and November 2016. Investors may alternately read the chart as a base formed between November 2015 and November 2016. Either reading is valid. And the ultimate breakout cleared both of those buy points in a single swoop.The S&P 500 notched a high in May 2015, then slipped into a long double-dip consolidation. This included the late August 2015 sell-off, begun in China, which wiped an estimated $2.1 trillion from U.S. stock markets in a six-day sell off. The index finally recovered to retake its May 2015 high in July 2016.Banks followed a slightly different timeline. JPMorgan chalked up its high in late July 2015. It quickly recovered from the late August sell-off. The bank was working its way through four quarters of earnings declines and weak revenue when it was hit again by powerful selling in January 2016. JPMorgan settled into a gradual uptrend, although bank stocks remained generally depressed ahead of what markets expected to be a Hillary Clinton presidency.That uptrend formed the right side of JPMorgan's 15-month saucer base.Because saucer bases tend to be long, there is a good deal of action that goes on within them. JP Morgan, for instance, formed a valid nine-week cup-with-handle base in June and July of 2016. It cleared the buy point of that handle on Aug. 4, 2016. Chart-wise, that may have been a valid breakout. But volume did not reach the 40%-above-average you'd like to see in a breakout. In addition, the bank had reported a gain of only 1% gain in its second quarter, even though that marked its first profit gain in five quarters.The stock barely lost ground, remaining sloggy through October, ahead of the presidential election. However, by this time, the company had reported a powerful 20% rise in Q3 earnings and a recovery to 10% revenue growth.On Nov. 9, bank stocks stepped into a leadership role as the market rallied on election results. JPMorgan broke out past potential buy points at 69.13 (1) and 70.71 (not seen on the accompanying chart). It also cleared the tops of handles that formed on the right side of the saucer. The stock was immediately extended, posting a 13% gain for the week and rallying more than 30% over the next three months.RELATED:Major Indexes Fall Broadly; These 2 Retailers Sink Especially HardThis Genetics Firm Broke Out On Improving Trends In Cancer TestingFast-Growing Tech Leader Joins IBD's Sector Leaders List No. 2 In Stock Checkup, This Stock Shows AccelerationPfizer Restructuring As It Plays Nice With Trump On Drug Price Hikes

182,A,"NATO: For Eurocrats, there never seems to be any downside to insulting President Trump, a man the EU's suave socialists love to hate. It has been on display as Trump prepares to meet with his fellow NATO members during his trip to Europe.Typical was the snarky, disrespectful reception for Trump prepared by European Council President Donald Tusk, on the eve of the much-awaited NATO meeting: ""First of all, dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many.""Tusk went on, talking about how Trump was ""criticizing Europe almost daily for, in his view, insufficient contributions to the common defense capabilities, and for living off the U.S.""He meant it to be snide and sarcastic. But Tusk's criticism is notable because, in fact, Trump's comments happen to too true. It's been an open secret for decades.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe European Union has used hefty U.S. defense spending and its willingness to send American troops into harm's way to protect Europe. It is in effect a kind of social welfare subsidy: We spend money on arms, they build ever-more generous welfare states.And then, from the safety of their left-leaning think tanks, universities and EU bureaucracies, they complain about American ""militarism,"" ""imperialism,"" and ""aggression.""It's getting tiresome, but it bears repeating. NATO's 28 members are required by the treaty that established the mutual defense organization to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.In 2016, President Obama's final year in office, the U.S. spent 3.6% of its GDP on defense, Greece 2.4%, the U.K. 2.2%, Estonia 2.16% and Poland 2%. Everyone else was below 2%. Everyone.And note that those that are pulling their weight are among Europe's poorest nations. The others should be ashamed, but shame is in short supply in Europe these days.It's the equivalent of going to a group dinner and, when presented with the check, having 23 diners come up short on the bill. And then ridiculing those who make up the difference.This year, after President Trump's repeated criticisms, NATO's ""burden-sharing"" will be better, but only marginally so. Just eight members will reach that lofty 2% goal. Remember, the U.S. has always exceeded it.A recent commentary on the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) web site admits as much.""European and American experts alike, including Trump's staunchest foes, admit that the president has a point and that Europeans should spend more on defense,"" write Jeremy Shapiro.A heart-felt mea culpa? Hardly. Shapiro, ECFR's director of research and an adjunct fellow at the Brookings Institution, goes on to accuse Trump of ""bullying.""If that's bullying, Europe deserves it. Europe's welfare states have never lived up to their part in the defense bargain. In the 1990s, when President Clinton was in office, European NATO forces were embarrassed at not being able to handle a conflict in the Balkans, right outside the EU's border. American airpower had to be brought in to end the conflict.Today, the media and internet web sites remember it as a ""NATO"" triumph. But the fact is, no U.S., no NATO.If Europe learned anything from that conflict, it's not apparent. A piece in The National Interest last week, citing the German magazine Der Spiegel, carried the headline: ""Germany's Air Force Is Dying a Slow Death."" It notes that the air force of Germany, continental Europe's wealthiest nation, has 128 Eurofighter Typhoons, a potentially potent force. Unfortunately, ""only about ten of the aircraft are ready for operations.""You can bet with Germany's Angela Merkel preoccupied with Brexit, NATO, a wave of immigration, and a growing political challenge from the Trump-like German right, the German Luftwaffe is pretty low on her list of priorities. And they're the wealthy ones. In nation after nation, other wealthy Europeans have made common defense a low priority.Maybe it's an end-of-civilization death wish: they think invasion and eventual takeover by uninvited invaders would be a good idea.At any rate, the U.S. has a minimal 30,000 troop presence in Europe today as a token commitment to Europe's defense.But, according to globalfirepower.com, Russia, Europe's most likely adversary in a conventional war or conflict, has 766,000 men under arms, with another two million or so in reserve. Europe simply isn't ready to defend itself, and despite U.S. spending on NATO over the years, our presence there isn't big enough to repel a major Russian incursion.And that doesn't include the various NATO engagements in the Mideast and elsewhere, as part of the ongoing battle against terrorist activities.The point is, Europe's NATO members must boost their efforts to defend themselves and carry their weight. These nations are still capable of excellence: A look at the final four nations in the World Cup soccer final are all NATO members. It's a matter of priorities.We know, President Trump's brusque tough-love is about as far away from the genteel, class-conscious European diplomatic sensibility as an American leader can get. But NATO's European members — Turkey, once a valued member, now a pariah, should be kicked out — need to listen to Trump. Europe is endangering itself and its allies by its lackadaisical defense posture. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away.Time to pay up, and make NATO a true common defense force, or admit NATO is a shell of its former self, and dismantle it.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Cold War 2.0: Obama Doctrine Of Weakness Has Reawakened The Russian BearDid Trump Just Save NATO By Shaming It?Would Trump Really Kill Off NATO?

183,A,"Marijuana stock Sunniva has revealed plans to spin off its Canadian assets and seek a separate listing for them on the Nasdaq and Toronto stock exchanges.XThe spun-off Canadian assets would include Sunniva Medical, which is building a 740,000-square-foot greenhouse in British Columbia that will be able to produce 100,000 kilograms of cannabis flower.Sunniva already has a two-year contract to supply Canopy Growth (CGC) with 45% of the production from the forthcoming greenhouse.Meanwhile, the Sunniva parent company will retain the U.S. assets. Those include CP Logistics, which will operate a proposed 489,000-square-foot greenhouse in Cathedral City, Calif., that will produce up to 160,000 kilograms of marijuana annually.The facility is scheduled to be fully operational in the third quarter and will include an on-site dispensary with a distribution license.Sunniva CEO Anthony Holler claimed the current company is undervalued, and that the spinoff will unlock value for existing shareholders.""Creating a new Canadian company with our Canadian assets and listing them on the TSX and NASDAQ would be expected to bring added visibility and additional analyst coverage to our story and has the potential to attract institutional investors that are currently unable to purchase stock on the CSE or purchase companies holding US assets,"" Holler said in a press release Wednesday.Among marijuana stocks, Canopy Growth, whose Canadian ticker is WEED, fell 0.1% on the stock market today. Cronos Group (CRON) rose 1.15%, while cannabis-focused exchange-traded fund ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) retreated 0.5%, and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which also has exposure to cannabis, dipped 0.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSunniva will continue to trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker SNN.But the proposed spinoff faces a number of hurdles. It requires both Sunniva shareholder approval and Canadian Securities Exchange approval. In addition it will have to fulfill the listing requirements of the Toronto and Nasdaq exchanges.Current shareholders will receive a proportionate number of shares in both companies.If Sunniva pulls off the spinoff, it would position itself to capture more U.S. growth.The American business will focus on full vertical integration in California and other states, and seek potential mergers and acquisitions or partnerships.It will also seek to expand it licensed retail business and the near term launch of Sunniva-branded products.""We believe having unencumbered US assets is very important and frees up the company to aggressively pursue an M&A strategy within the largest cannabis market in the world (California),"" Beacon Securities managing director Doug Cooper said in a research note.He estimated Sunniva has an enterprise value of around $220 million, but that does not reflect the true value either the U.S. or Canadian assets.Canada's cannabis industry has been rushing to consolidate amid recreational legalization this year.On Wednesday, it emerged leading marijuana stock Canopy Growth had managed to smoke out the competition as it sealed a $205 million deal to acquire rival Hiku Brands.And the world's top marijuana grower Aurora Cannabis agreed to gobble up Anandia Laboratories for around $88 million in an all-stock transaction last month.Aurora Cannabis has been a big mover in the country's fledgling marijuana industry.

184,A,"Swing trading relies heavily on technical analysis. While many traders may focus on a stock's price action, a stock's volume is also a critical component for trading success. Heavy trading volume confirms the strength of price moves and can identify flaws in price moves that might be weaker than they look.Trading volume serves two main functions for a swing trader's analysis. First, it identifies liquidity. When there is more trading volume you have a whole host of players competing with their best prices buying and selling shares. It makes the spread tighter and more competitive between the bid and the ask (the best price you can sell or buy a stock for). Second, heavy volume identifies when there is intensity behind price action. You could have a jump in price from a single transaction of a few hundred shares and it doesn't tell you much. A jump in price due to thousands of transactions with lots of money trading hands gives the price move more meaning. It's often the result of trading by institutions, like the big mutual funds.But what does it mean to have heavy volume? Heavy compared to what? A million shares traded in Amazon.com (AMZN) would be remarkable for how low it is. For a stock like Dominos Pizza (DPZ), a million shares is double its 50-day average volume. In position trades, the 50-day average volume is a good standard to measure against. But for swing trading, the shorter time frame changes your comparison. With a target of a 10-day trade length, you can use the volume relative to the past couple weeks as a gauge.When Ross Stores (ROST) initially broke out of a cup-with-handle, it wasn't suitable as a position trade due to low volume. But we kept it on our radar for a short-term move as a swing trade.A move to new highs after an eight-day consolidation saw volume that was lower than nearly all of the eight prior days (1). A brief try to new high ground quickly saw a lack of demand and a subsequent decline (2). A few days later it joined IBD's SwingTrader as a watch list stock (3). Its tight trading was compelling, especially since the market was declining. The retail group was also one of the strongest out there. If we could get trading volume behind a price move, that could increase our chances for success.On June 27, Ross Stores vaulted 2% in the morning. We sent an alert out that we were waiting for a better read on trading volume before triggering the trade, but it never came. After a couple hours into the trading session, the stock erased its gains for the day and was in negative territory. It ended with an ugly bearish reversal for the day (4).We avoided a losing trade by using the volume clue. Although it hasn't dropped sharply, at best it would have been dead money for a few weeks. Sometimes it's the trades you don't do that can make the difference.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Sherlock Holmes And The Case Of Missing VolumeVolume Clues Complement Price Action For StocksVolume Speaks Volumes About Stock TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

198,A,"In the cup with handle or double bottom, success of the breakout depends on the way a stock rises and falls within the base.A third pattern shows that a stock can choose to take neither path before its big move north.Rather than go on an uptrend or downtrend, the stock moves sideways for weeks or months. This action — or lack of it — becomes what's called the flat base.This pattern often forms after a stock breaks out of a cup or other base, gains ground for a few weeks, then stalls. Why? The market might not be ready to rally strongly, or is still weak.A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of bending lower, it holds steady in price. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.When the market finally begins to rally, the stock explodes out of its crouch position.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA flat base must be at least five weeks in length. It can last much longer than that. Within the base, the percentage decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. When the stock drops within the base, institutional investors step in to shore up the stock. The stock doesn't fall much more because investors overall feel comfortable with the stock's current price.When should you buy? Wait until the stock rises 10 cents above the highest price in the flat base. Sometimes the price high is found on the left end of the base. In other cases, the high is in the middle of the base or on the right. Just add 10 cents to that price to find the pivot. Buy it as close as possible to that price point. Don't chase it if it's already more than 5% above the pivot.Oracle (ORCL), the database and e-commerce software giant, muscled out of a seven-month cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999 (1).

Add a dime to get the buy point. Oracle briefly poked above the flat base's 47.04 buy point during the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, but stumbled. A week later, Oracle dropped more than 8% below the prime entry, ushering the golden rule of investing. Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground.

Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06.

Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground. The enterprise software group was ranked third among 197 groups.Oracle gained 273% through its March 2000 peak.Here are three more good flat bases that formed in 2016 and 2017 and yielded strong breakouts:Align Technology (ALGN), breakout on Feb. 21, 2017: The nine-week flat base began on Dec. 19, 2016, when the invisible braces marketer peaked at 102.10. Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06. Turnover mushroomed to 5.9 million shares, 609% above average. Total decline within the six-week base: 15.2%.(A version of this column was originally published in the March 26, 2002, edition of IBD.

204,A,"The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday it's appealing a judge's decision that allowed AT&T (T) to take over Time Warner, renewing the government's antitrust fight against the creation of a media and telecommunications giant that already has been consummated.XThe department's antitrust division filed a notice of appeal Thursday in Washington federal court. AT&T slipped 1.3% in after-hours trading on the stock market today.A Justice Department win at the appeals level would undo a stinging rebuke for the government. It also would vindicate the decision by the head of the antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, to challenge the takeover.Industry analysts watched the case closely. It was the first instance in decades that a court has decided on a merger of companies that operate in different parts of a supply chain. A loss would set a binding precedent that could restrict future enforcement against these so-called vertical deals.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAT&T closed the Time Warner transaction on June 14, two days after U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's ruling. The Justice Department agreed not to seek an emergency court order preventing the deal from closing. It did so after AT&T promised to operate Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting as a separate business unit until 2019.Leon had rejected the argument AT&T will have power to raise prices that cable and satellite-TV companies pay for content such as CNN. The government said the merger could lead to higher bills for consumers. AT&T countered that the government's economic model was riddled with flaws. It also said the deal will enable AT&T and Time Warner to more effectively compete against companies such as Netflix (NFLX).The ruling was a blow to Delrahim's approach to reviewing vertical mergers. For years, companies won antitrust approval for these deals by agreeing to restrictions on how they conduct business.Delrahim rejected those behavioral settlements last year. He said they required enforcers to act as regulators who must ensure companies comply with their promises. Instead, companies should have to sell assets to fix competitive problems stemming from mergers, he said.That stance led to the AT&T lawsuit in November. Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson refused the government's demand to sell DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting.

215,A,"Subsidies: According to the federal government, almost 1.4 billion pounds of surplus cheese now sit in refrigerated warehouses around the country. Yet dairy production is climbing. What gives?The amount of surplus cheese is growing fast — up 6% in just the past year.According to news accounts, the reason is that dairy production is climbing, while dairy consumption is falling. Data from the Department of Agriculture show that between 2008 and 2017, milk production in the U.S. climbed 13%.Over those same years, however, consumption has sagged — with per capita milk consumption down 14%, USDA data show.The surplus milk gets stored as cheese. If formed into one giant wheel, the current 1.39-billion-pound cheese surplus would be about as big as the U.S. Capitol Building.Two years ago, the Obama administration effectively bailed out the industry, when it bought up $20 million worth — 11 million pounds — of cheese, which it then used for food assistance programs. But the stockpile has grown 16% since then.If all this sounds odd, it is.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn what other industry would you find producers continuing to ramp up production while demand slides, and then stuffing the growing pile of surplus into warehouses, hoping the federal government will buy some of it?What makes the dairy industry different is decades of government efforts to ""support"" dairy farmers with various subsidy schemes. The 2014 farm bill did away with old federal price support programs, but replaced them with heavily subsidized insurance that essentially guarantees margins for those who sign up. This year, the dairy industry successfully lobbied Congress to expand this subsidy program.By interfering with pricing signals, the effect of these subsidies has been to encourage production, almost regardless of market demand. It's a problem not just with the dairy industry, but with other agricultural products on the receiving end of government largesse.Each year, in fact, taxpayers fork over more than $20 billion to subsidize corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, dairy and a few other commodities. Critics of these subsidies say that not only do these programs distort the market, but they tend to benefit big agribusinesses at the expense of family farms.The 2014 bill was supposed to include provisions to prevent dairy overproduction, but clearly it hasn't worked as intended.Dairy farmers say they need these programs to survive. We doubt that. Like every other industry, they'd learn to adapt to market changes.In the meantime, ask yourself this question: Why should taxpayers hand over their hard-earned money to protect other people's jobs in a declining industry?No, Gasoline Prices Are Not 'Too High'Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Housing Crisis May Be Inevitable, Thanks To Government Meddling

It has broken ground on another french fry line in Hermiston, Ore., with similar capacity, which it expects to be operational in its fiscal fourth quarter 2019.Plus, it opened a new facility with an annual capacity of 180 million pounds of potatoes in Russia. Lamb Weston sells products in more than 100 countries and has 24 manufacturing plants around the globe.The company is focusing on product innovation to drive sales growth. Its current lineup shows a huge assortment of different ways to prepare potatoes. In fries alone, it offers straight, crinkle, curly, waffle and wedge cuts in different sizes, textures and seasonings. There are also potato chips, hash browns, tater tots, cubes, pancakes and varieties of mash.Like the scene in ""Forrest Gump"" where a character lists all the ways you can prepare shrimp, the litany of potato products seems to never end.In April, Lamb Weston introduced a new product called the Seashore Puff. It's a potato puff seasoned throughout with sea salt, black pepper and garlic.Earlier this year, it also introduced a way for food delivery services to keep fries hot and crispy in transit. The Crispy on Delivery offering combines product and packaging innovations.""It's a comprehensive solution that enables fries to stay hot and crispy for the fast growing home delivery channel,"" CEO Werner said. ""It is a promising solution to help customers expand delivery of fries which are typically the highest margin food product on their menus while meeting a clear consumer opportunity.""Crispy on Delivery fries maintain heat and crispiness for 30 minutes, while traditional fries start to lose their appeal after only 5 minutes. The new fry is lightly battered to withstand the challenges of delivery without sacrificing taste, the company said.Lamb Weston spun off from Conagra (CAG) in November 2016 and ended its first day of trading at 31.84. Since then, it has formed five bases and broken out of each to run higher.The stock broke out of a six-week flat base at a buy point of 68.80 on June 26. It trended sideways for several days, but climbed back into the buy zone Thursday with a 2% gain. Lamb Weston shares were up just 0.4% Friday, but that was enough to reach an all-time closing high of 70.19 on the stock market today. Its intraday high was 70.50.The company trounced sales-and-earnings expectations for the quarter ended Feb. 25 and guided Wall Street higher for the May quarter.Lamb Weston earned 91 cents a share on sales of $863 million, while analysts expected 77 cents and $814 million. Earnings per share jumped 54% year over year, compared with declines in the previous four quarters. Sales rose 12%, accelerating from single-digit gains in the preceding five quarters.The company said it expects fiscal 2018 sales to grow at the upper end of the mid-single digit range. It also targeted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $805 million to $810 million. That compares with its prior outlook of $780 million to $790 million.Lamb Weston has not yet set a date for reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results, but that's expected to happen in late July.Analysts expect the company to earn 62 cents a share on sales of $890 million. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 22% in earnings per share and 7% in revenue.The company expects a fourth-quarter tail wind from its Grown in Idaho brand retail products. The items have gained distribution with several large new customers, Werner said.""Over the next few months we will step up marketing investments to support this growth and that of our other brands,"" Werner said on the recent earnings call, which took place April 5.Lamb Weston cautioned that it sees increases in agricultural production and transportation costs. That could provide a headwind to growth.""We continue to believe that we are well positioned to create shareholder value over the long-term by focusing on our strategic and operational objectives,"" Werner said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

224,A,"Investors in dividend-rich real estate investment trusts should generally not expect to see big capital gains in such stocks. But the hefty payouts can make a high-quality REIT attractive for long-term holding. Consider Independence Realty Trust, an apartment REIT based in Philadelphia.Independence Realty (IRT) went public in August 2013 at $8.50 a share. The stock's close at 10.30 on Tuesday produces a 21% gain over nearly a five-year span.The S&P 500, in contrast, has rallied 64% since its close of 1655 in the week ended Aug. 16, 2013.Payouts, however, are a different story. As seen in the General Market Indicators page (view it via the link at the bottom of The Big Picture), the 500's annualized yield is 1.84%. The strong advance over the past nine years has depressed that yield somewhat. Still, the S&P 500 cannot hold a candle to Independence Realty's 7% yield.So, assuming the share price of Independence Realty Trust (IRT) doesn't move much from year to year, a long-term investor can aim at getting a decent return based on dividends alone.On April 20 and July 20, Independence paid holders 18 cents a share, up sharply from the 6 cents it paid over the prior four years going back to February 2014.The Philadelphia-based company focuses on selling apartment-building complexes that typically hold 150 to 500 units. As of mid-June, it owned and operated 56 multifamily properties totaling 15,280 units. Most of the properties are located in the South, parts of the Midwest (including Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri), and the Southwest. Key cities include Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., Memphis, Tenn., and Raleigh, N.C.As noted in a June 14 news release, IRT says its strategy is ""gaining scale within key amenity rich submarkets that offer good school districts, high-quality retail and major employment centers.""Revenue has shown excellent long-term growth, rising from $20 million in 2013 to $161 million last year. Funds from operations have shown remarkable stability, coming in at 70 cents per share to 83 cents in each of the past five years. The Street sees FFO at 75 cents per share, up 1%.Chairman Scott Schaeffer has held the CEO helm since February 2013 and boasts more than 25 years of experience in the industry.RELATED:The Current REIT LeadersWhich Financial Services Firms Show A Bigger Dividend Yield Than Western Union?How To Buy And Sell Growth Stocks Correctly: Read This Column Each Day

225,A,"All too often, stocks drop below their buy points only to bounce back above them. The big question for investors is, should they buy the second time around?The answer is yes, so long as the break below the buy point is modest and shares don't spend weeks below the entry.A minor decline is quite normal. Historically, 40% of stocks will dip back to or mildly below their buy points after a solid breakout, then resume their winning advances. So even when stocks exhibit power at the breakout, it's almost normal for them to recede to around the buy point.But once a stock falls 7% or 8% below the proper buy point in a good base, consider the breakout a failure. Such a loss triggers an automatic sell rule. You need to forget about the stock unless it later forms a new, sound pattern.Sometimes stocks will give signals that they'll bounce back. For example, the stock may make bullish price reversals or close near session highs on a daily or weekly basis. Or, the stock may bounce from a touch of the 50-day moving average. Both would indicate that institutional investors are buying on dips. Lacking those signals, a solid move back above the entry is still enough to make a purchase.One other point: If a stock reclaims the buy point, volume may be lackluster or weak. While big volume is ideal, what's more important is for the initial breakout to have strong volume. It should be at least 40% more than the 50-day average (a figure found in IBD Charts and IBD quotes); expect small and mid-cap stocks to show even higher volume, double or triple average.Chinese internet company Sina (SINA) broke out Aug. 7 last year past a 97.89 buy point; a few days later, it was below the buy point. Shares sank no more than 6% from the entry, so there was no sell signal. Instead, Sina found support at the 50-day line; on Aug. 11 it reversed higher (1), a bullish sign.The stock rose back above 97.89 the next session and sailed to 119.20 in five weeks, resulting in a robust gain of 22% and a good time to take profits.Whenever a stock spends several weeks below the buy point, unable to reclaim it, then the situation is more delicate. Chances are, the stock will form a new base and investors must wait for the pattern and new entry to develop.Atlassian (TEAM) broke out past a 38 buy point on July 25, 2017, and soon fell back below it. But instead of reclaiming the entry, the stock wound up forming a new base the next 10 weeks.The breakout from that August-early October formation at 39.35 has been the most successful ever for the work-collaboration software maker. Today, shares trade around 63.35, up 61% from the latest proper entry point.(A version of this column was first published on Jan. 12, 2018.

226,A,"In IBD's specialty financial services industry group, IBD Dividend Leaders stock Western Union (WU) does not have the highest annual dividend yield.At 3.7%, Western Union actually ranks behind Liberty Tax (TAX), which holds a 7.5% annualized yield. Western also trails Navient (NAVI) (4.9%), Yintech Investment (YIN) (4.8%) and H&R Block (HRB) (4.2%).So why does Western Union earn a spot within IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, which on Friday featured 16 stocks?Share price is a key factor. The better-performing stocks tend to trade at least 10 a share. For that reason, Liberty Tax and Yintech don't make the cut. Navient trades just 13.14 a share; Western Union trades near 20.33 a share and trades just 11% below a multiyear peak of 22.84.Earnings stability is another key factor. Here, Western Union is superior.The Englewood, Colo., firm shows a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Stable earnings support ongoing dividend payments. On March 30 and June 29 this year, Western Union paid a dividend of 19 cents a share. That's up 19% from the 16 cents it paid each quarter in 2016.H&R Block gets a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 26 from William O'Neil + Co. That's not bad at all, especially considering the highly seasonal nature of the tax return business.In a May 23 edition of The Income Investor, IBD highlights the level of competition within the money transfer market. The story also highlights Western Union's core competitive strengths.In recent weeks, Western Union shares have found buying support near its rising 10-week moving average.

243,A,"There are 2,127 exchange traded funds in the U.S. with $3.6 trillion in assets under management. Only 234 are actively managed ETFs holding just $57.2 billion, according to ETF.com, a leading information source on the industry.To be clear, active ETFs, which have been around 10 years, make up 11% of the funds but hold only 1.6% of its assets.At ETF.com's Inside Smart Beta & Active ETFs Summit earlier this month, industry insiders discussed ""Active Management: Why This Time Is Different.""Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com asked, ""How did we get here?""""Low costs vs. high costs,"" said Richard Powers, head of ETF Product Management at Vanguard. ""Too many active managers charging high fees and not delivering what they offer. Investors are going to go the passive route. It's not that active doesn't have a future — but can you do it in a low-cost way?""Equity mutual funds in the U.S. hold $15.9 trillion in assets under management. About 79%, or $12.5 trillion are in actively managed funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group. Last year, $151.2 billion flowed out of active equity funds, while index equity funds received inflows of $223 billion. This year through April 30, active equity had outflows of $43.2 billion and index equity posted inflows of $72.7 billion, said ICI.Meanwhile, last year and this year, both active and index ETFs posted inflows. In 2017, actives took in $15 billion; indexes gobbled up $454 billion. Through April 30 this year, active inflows were $7.4 billion, while index inflows were $77.3 billion, according to ICI.""If you talk about all fund types, you see flows cascading out of expensive (and) into cheap,"" said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Right around 40 basis points is where outflows stop and inflows start.""Balchunas explained how his group did analysis and broke down all ETF and mutual funds into expense-ratio buckets separated by increments of 10 basis points (bp): 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc.He said it didn't matter if the structure was active or index. Even index funds that charged 30 bp or 40 bp saw outflows, while index funds charging less than 10 bp saw inflows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""No matter which bucket you looked in, you saw the same exact trend: people migrating south,"" Balchunas said. ""I call low-cost migration the mother of all trends. The whole thing is, people just want cheap. They don't want to pay for their investments anymore. So, no actives over 40 bp.""He said the average fee for active ETFs is 81 bp. On average, smart beta ETFs are less than half the cost of active ETFs.""I think active ETFs are ripe for a fee war,"" said Balchunas.However, all agreed that if an active ETF significantly outperforms the market, it could charge whatever it wants. They pointed to ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which surged 85% last year and was up 27.9% through June 19. It charges an expense ratio of 0.75%.But so far, that all seems like an acceleration of old news.""What is different is mostly a bit of desperation,"" said Nadig. ""There's a growing realization that traditional equity shops need some response to ETFs. The choice is to put your head in the sand and watch your assets go away or wade into some nontransparent structure and hope the Security and Exchange Commission approves. The nontransparency which they are desperate to keep is the big bugaboo.""Vanguard's Powers said active managers are loath to come out with transparent products because they ""don't want to reveal their secret sauce."" So most active mutual fund shops have filed with the SEC to create ETFs with a nontransparent structure. They have not received approval yet. But, if the SEC does approve such a structure, Powers expects to see many more active ETFs. If the SEC denies them, Powers said, they would still get into the ETF space with smart beta products.""I worked for traditional asset management companies before joining the ETF space five years ago,"" said Linda Zhang, chief executive of Purview Investments, a New York RIA specializing in ETF managed portfolios. ""Many don't know how to deal with the changing environment. There's an inherent discomfort for these companies to transform from traditional products to ETFs because of the fear of losing margins. It's a completely different business model: How ETFs are managed, traded and distributed. It's not as easy as people think — that you can just transform the traditional mutual fund business into ETFs.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:These 3 Stock Sectors May Fare Well In The Current Economic CycleSmall-Cap Stocks Rocket Higher; Top China Fund Nears Buy PointIndex Funds Performance: Dow Lags As This Blue-Chip Stock Weighs

247,A,"If you follow the Investor's Business Daily analysis of the stock market closely, you know that a significant shift took place this past Monday.The Nasdaq composite got hammered by sellers on June 25, falling 2.1% in heavy turnover. That sell-off, combined with a dearth of impressive breakouts lately and a large load of distribution days (or significant declines in higher turnover), sent IBD's Market Pulse outlook in The Big Picture column one notch down to ""uptrend under pressure.""The outlook change doesn't mean you must sell the top dogs in your portfolio. View the new status as a yellow light on a traffic signal. Don't come to a full stop. Proceed with caution. But as the IBD 50 shows, if you hold many superior growth stocks, then you likely felt the heat of institutional selling a lot more than your neighbor who exclusively trades index ETFs.Major indexes showed nice rebounds on Thursday and through Friday afternoon trade. The S&P 500 cut its weekly loss to less than 0.6%. But companies in the IBD 50 shaved off a lot more of their recent gains. Twenty names, or 40% of the entire list, slumped more than 3% for the week through Thursday's close. Only Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and two more gained 2% or more.If you bought a true leader early in its run and your paper profit has topped 50%, 100%, or more, then you have the luxury of choices. If the stock is correcting in normal fashion, you might keep the entire position and wait for it to break out again. Or you might sell some shares, and give the rest a chance to grow more. A third option? Sell the entire position. Sit on the cash until you find a new royal opportunity.But what if your post-breakout gain runs in the 10% to 25% range? If you didn't take at least partial profits on the way up, then consider deciding where to draw the line in the sand.One of the most relevant sell rules: Don't let a double-digit gain turn into a loss. To go from, say, a 28% gain to an 8% loss not only hurts your portfolio; it can damage your personal investing psychology. If you come away with a single- or small double-digit gain, you can always buy back shares when the market shows better action.Momo (MOMO) illustrates how the 10-day moving average could help investors keep most of the advance after a May 18 breakout.At first, the move above a 40.55 buy point in an eight-week cup base was dull. But six sessions later, the Chinese social media play roared like a lion. It gapped up 15% in heavy volume on superb Q1 results (EPS up 57% to 69 cents, revenue up 64% to $435.1 million). Nine trading days later, the gain from 40.55 to a new high of 54.24 gushed up to 33%. A great profit.Besides selling on the way up once the stock hits the 20%-25% profit zone? Look for a sharp undercut of the short-term 10-day moving average. Momo did just that on June 19, falling 3.8% to 51.09. The 10-day line stood at a lofty 52.09, well above the 50-day moving average's value of 41.18. Sell at the June 19 close, and you would have locked in a 26% profit. (The 10-day line is not plotted on IBD Charts but is available in MarketSmith.)Momo's cup was lodged inside a larger, much deeper base. The stock has a penchant for making really big moves, really fast. So the recent waterfall slide to 41.44, just 2% above the 40.55 breakout point, should not come as a big surprise.All daily charts in IBD Leaderboard show the 10-day moving average as a green line.You can trade the IBD 50 in just one transaction with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

275,A,"There are 2,127 exchange traded funds in the U.S. with $3.6 trillion in assets under management. Only 234 are actively managed ETFs holding just $57.2 billion, according to ETF.com, a leading information source on the industry.To be clear, active ETFs, which have been around 10 years, make up 11% of the funds but hold only 1.6% of its assets.At ETF.com's Inside Smart Beta & Active ETFs Summit earlier this month, industry insiders discussed ""Active Management: Why This Time Is Different.""Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com asked, ""How did we get here?""""Low costs vs. high costs,"" said Richard Powers, head of ETF Product Management at Vanguard. ""Too many active managers charging high fees and not delivering what they offer. Investors are going to go the passive route. It's not that active doesn't have a future — but can you do it in a low-cost way?""Equity mutual funds in the U.S. hold $15.9 trillion in assets under management. About 79%, or $12.5 trillion are in actively managed funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group. Last year, $151.2 billion flowed out of active equity funds, while index equity funds received inflows of $223 billion. This year through April 30, active equity had outflows of $43.2 billion and index equity posted inflows of $72.7 billion, said ICI.Meanwhile, last year and this year, both active and index ETFs posted inflows. In 2017, actives took in $15 billion; indexes gobbled up $454 billion. Through April 30 this year, active inflows were $7.4 billion, while index inflows were $77.3 billion, according to ICI.""If you talk about all fund types, you see flows cascading out of expensive (and) into cheap,"" said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Right around 40 basis points is where outflows stop and inflows start.""Balchunas explained how his group did analysis and broke down all ETF and mutual funds into expense-ratio buckets separated by increments of 10 basis points (bp): 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc.He said it didn't matter if the structure was active or index. Even index funds that charged 30 bp or 40 bp saw outflows, while index funds charging less than 10 bp saw inflows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""No matter which bucket you looked in, you saw the same exact trend: people migrating south,"" Balchunas said. ""I call low-cost migration the mother of all trends. The whole thing is, people just want cheap. They don't want to pay for their investments anymore. So, no actives over 40 bp.""He said the average fee for active ETFs is 81 bp. On average, smart beta ETFs are less than half the cost of active ETFs.""I think active ETFs are ripe for a fee war,"" said Balchunas.However, all agreed that if an active ETF significantly outperforms the market, it could charge whatever it wants. They pointed to ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which surged 85% last year and was up 27.9% through June 19. It charges an expense ratio of 0.75%.But so far, that all seems like an acceleration of old news.""What is different is mostly a bit of desperation,"" said Nadig. ""There's a growing realization that traditional equity shops need some response to ETFs. The choice is to put your head in the sand and watch your assets go away or wade into some nontransparent structure and hope the Security and Exchange Commission approves. The nontransparency which they are desperate to keep is the big bugaboo.""Vanguard's Powers said active managers are loath to come out with transparent products because they ""don't want to reveal their secret sauce."" So most active mutual fund shops have filed with the SEC to create ETFs with a nontransparent structure. They have not received approval yet. But, if the SEC does approve such a structure, Powers expects to see many more active ETFs. If the SEC denies them, Powers said, they would still get into the ETF space with smart beta products.""I worked for traditional asset management companies before joining the ETF space five years ago,"" said Linda Zhang, chief executive of Purview Investments, a New York RIA specializing in ETF managed portfolios. ""Many don't know how to deal with the changing environment. There's an inherent discomfort for these companies to transform from traditional products to ETFs because of the fear of losing margins. It's a completely different business model: How ETFs are managed, traded and distributed. It's not as easy as people think — that you can just transform the traditional mutual fund business into ETFs.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:These 3 Stock Sectors May Fare Well In The Current Economic CycleSmall-Cap Stocks Rocket Higher; Top China Fund Nears Buy PointIndex Funds Performance: Dow Lags As This Blue-Chip Stock Weighs

276,A,"For a small player in the ETF industry, ARK Invest is making the best of its few exchange traded funds. Of six total ETFs, three are performing well enough to make IBD's ETF Leaders screen.It's an impressive batting average resulting from the firm's investments in ""disruptive innovation."" That's a broad term for groundbreaking technologies, medical cures and other life-changing breakthroughs. Finding emerging disrupters can result in lucrative investments, but they're not easy to spot.The New York-based firm uses its chief investment officer and portfolio manager, a director of research, and a team of analysts who scour emerging trends for potential investments and conduct fundamental analysis on the most promising companies. Tom Staudt, ARK Invest chief operating officer, says the firm uses its own models to pick stocks.For example, while the market tends to have an investment horizon of three to six months, ARK analysts are looking where companies might be three to four years out. And while Wall Street puts companies in specific sectors, ARK may view them in multiple areas. That helps explain why electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) is in an internet fund.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe three ARK portfolios are actively managed and their holdings can change on any given day. That's necessary to ""be nimble in the changing world of technology,"" Staudt said.Some details on the three ARKs in IBD's computer-generated ETF Leaders:ARK Web X. 0 (ARKW) seeks companies blazing new paths on the internet. That includes cloud computing, Big Data, online commerce, blockchain technology and the Internet of Things. Specifically, the ETF's major holdings are Tesla, Amazon.com (AMZN), Twitter (TWTR), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA).Among the lesser-known holdings is 2U (TWOU), a company that works with universities developing digital learning, and Teladoc (TDOC), a provider of physicians over the internet. The fund, with $629 million in assets as of June 30, has a total of about 40 stocks.ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector (ARKG) is aimed at gene therapies, drug discoveries and other scientific advances that study a person's genes to pinpoint health problems and treatments.The largest holding (12% of the fund) is Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA). The company is working on CRISPR/CAS9, a science that uses natural DNA repair mechanisms. The $203 million fund has 37 holdings.ARK Innovation (ARKK) owns stocks in multiple sectors that meet the firm's disruptive-innovation objectives. As such, ARK Innovation's portfolio overlaps some with the other two ETFs'.The two largest holdings are also the top holdings of ARK Genomic and ARK Web X. 0, Intellia Therapeutics and Tesla. With $1.1 billion in assets, it's larger than the other two ARKs combined. Its portfolio has more than 40 stocks, with the largest investments in technology and health care.For short- and intermediate-term ETF investors, the three ARKs are in buy areas after pullbacks to their 50-day moving averages. In these situations, it's best to buy as close as possible to the moving average line.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Tesla Signs Deal To Build Massive China Car Factory In ShanghaiThese 5 Oil ETFs Are Forming Bullish Chart PatternsActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders Index

277,A,"Global branded apparel play and blue chip stock leader Nike (NKE) headed a relative mild list of stocks hitting new highs Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average component leapt as much as 13% and hit an all-time high of 81.Volume was more than quadruple the stock's 50-day average. That's a telltale sign that banks, hedge funds, pension plans and mutual funds stormed into the stock.While short covering may have helped the cause, the total short interest in Nike is actually quite small. Through June 15, roughly 22 million shares were sold short. That compares with a float of 1.25 billion shares.The athleisure apparel and shoe giant looks to follow in the footsteps of another blue chip stock leader, Apple (AAPL), in the sense that the company is blazing a fresh path of double-digit earnings growth. That's good for the longs on Wall Street.The stock has now ramped up as much as 15% past a recent breakout from a flat base at 70.35. The 5% buy zone went up to 73.87.In its latest results for the fiscal fourth quarter ended in May, Nike late Thursday reported a 15% jump in profit to 69 cents a share. That beat the Thomson Reuters estimate by a nickel. Revenue climbed 13% to $9.79 billion. That's the best combination of top- and bottom-line increases since the Beaverton, Ore., company posted a 23% rise in EPS on 15% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Net margin for Nike's latest quarter held steady at 11.6%.Elsewhere, Hess (HES) rallied for the third time in four sessions. At Friday's peak, shares in the oil and gas explorer reached as high as 68.40. At that price, the stock advanced 3.7% past a 65.99 buy point in a narrow flat base. The latest base is a first-stage base on base.In a flat base, the maximum decline allowed is 15% from head to toe. Hess, which joined IBD's Swing Trader on Friday, is less than 12%.Within the base, Hess showed a solid accumulation week as shares rallied 7.5% in above-average trade during the week ended June 22.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Hot Large Cap Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20How To Invest: Check This Column Every Week For Upcoming News On EarningsThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

279,A,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1.

The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1.

289,A,"Global stock markets continued their dislocation in June as small-cap stock funds led the advance in U.S. equities. International stocks, meanwhile, suffered further declines due to signs of weakness in the ""global synchronized growth"" which had propelled global equity markets going into 2018.World equity funds on average fell 2.04%, 2.96% and 2.87% in June, Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, according to data from Lipper Inc. Meanwhile, small-cap growth funds jumped 1.32%, 8.69% and 12.18% in those periods.The average U.S. diversified equity fund advanced 0.45%, 3.71% and 3.36%. Large-cap growth also did well, while value and alternative strategy funds lagged. By comparison, general U.S. Treasury funds rose 0.25% in June and 0.12% in Q2, for a yearly decline of 2.08%. However, corporate debt funds fell, resulting in the taxable bond fund group's overall decline despite high yield's solid performance.That said, Fidelity's Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer observed that U.S. markets remain in a ""twilight zone. Until January of this year, we had everything going for us: Fairly easy financial conditions and strong earnings growth from the tax cut provided a tremendous tailwind for the market.""However, since January, the market has been in a stalemate, he notes. Tightening liquidity due to rising interest rates and a stronger dollar have been a headwind for the market: ""It's like a tug of war, and the market has been stuck right in the middle of those two opposing tensions.""What Keeps Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Going StrongSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong the largest funds, $85 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index (NAESX) soared 5.07% in June, for a Q2 gain of 6.59%, beating others by a wide margin. The fund holds such growth stocks as network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), financial software provider SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC), design software maker PTC (PTC), domain name marketer GoDaddy (GDDY) and ski resort operator Vail Resorts (MTN), all of which are up between 30% and 46% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity's Timmer says he's seeing a pretty big separation in leadership. As of May, small-caps, which are mostly a pure play on the U.S. domestic economy, ""have broken out and made new highs, while the S&P 500 is still stuck in the trench,"" he said. The S&P 500 index, which has big exposure to foreign markets, rose 0.58%, 3.31% and 2.41% during the one-month, Q2 and H1 periods.He also pointed out that price increases by FAANG stocks, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), accelerated in June and remains very strong. This advance came at the expense of industrials (which did very well last year), and of financial stocks.Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at American Century Investments, says that since the last two months of 2017 and throughout 2018, he's been more cautious on equities: ""Depending on the specific strategy, we either went to a neutral position — that is we weren't going to be overweighting stocks or buying on the dips anymore — or for our more risk-sensitive investors, such as in our target-date retirees entities, we actually moved to underweight equities. It's worked out fairly well for us overall.""Weiss explains that although economic growth continues to accelerate modestly, ""the primary source of that growth has continuously come from the corporate sector, in large part induced by the tax reform and the shot in the arm from the lower corporate tax rates. More importantly, we have not seen the beneficial halo effect for the consumer.""Other warning signs include a number of potentially inflationary pressures on the horizon: rising oil prices, potential wage inflation, accommodative fiscal policy and barriers to trade. ""You add higher interest rates, which are a done deal at this point, then the specter of inflation to an already somewhat muddled outlook for economic growth,"" he said, which results in an environment not that favorable for the stock markets. And while corporate earnings continue to do fairly well, ""they're a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator.""In addition, growth numbers out of Europe, U.K. and Japan have come in weaker, thus dislocating the synchronicity of growth experienced by worldwide markets earlier in the year.For the remainder of 2018, Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust, expects continued volatility and mid-single-digit returns for large-cap stocks. But a recession appears unlikely in the near-term.""Small-cap stock performance has been quite positive of late. This is one of several indicators that leads us to believe a recession is likely not on the horizon anytime soon,"" he said.American Century's Weiss points out that we're in the 10th year of an economic recovery, which is ""more than twice the length of a typical U.S. market cycle — it's pretty long in the tooth.""His message to investors is: ""Whatever you've been doing over the last nine years or so that may have worked for you is likely not to be the same strategy that works for you over the next year or two, because of this potential inflection point. Naively buying on the dips in the stock market works well in a bull market, but it certainly does not in a choppy market or a bear market if that's to come ... It is possible that cash is in the running to be king this year.

290,A,"Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund owes much of its success in investing in growth stocks to great team work. And this top-performing mutual fund's team is bigger than most funds' — big enough to field a baseball team.The $1.5 billion Federated Kaufmann Small Cap(FKASX) has nine portfolio managers. Each covers stocks in industries in which they have expertise. As a result, the portfolio recently has been investing in growth stocks such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), Grubhub (GRUB), Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS), RealPage (RP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL). All are market leaders with IBD EPS Ratings of 90 or higher and Relative Strength Ratings ranging from 99 to 83.This year through June 30, investing in growth stocks like these have brought gains ranging from 24% by enterprise software maker RealPage to 86% by upscale winter wear maker Canada Goose.Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund has another trait that stands out. The portfolio has held many of its heavy-hitting stocks since they first came to market.With its team of experts working together to find new companies that the fund can hold long-term, this top mutual fund as of Dec. 31 has beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. That feat makes it a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd it's won the award in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and small-cap funds. And that's no easy feat: Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.Fund lead manager Stephen DeNichilo, 42 years old, has been with federated since 2012 and has 20 years investment experience. He discussed his fund's hot streak and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from his team's offices in Manhattan.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportBeyond Q2: Stock Fund Managers' Outlook NowMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Nine portfolio managers guide this fund. Why so many?DeNichilo: There are two lead managers, me and John Ettinger. Each portfolio manager has buy and sell discretion. ... Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

International stocks, meanwhile, suffered further declines due to signs of weakness in the ""global synchronized growth"" which had propelled global equity markets going into 2018.World equity funds on average fell 2.04%, 2.96% and 2.87% in June, Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, according to data from Lipper Inc. Meanwhile, small-cap growth funds jumped 1.32%, 8.69% and 12.18% in those periods.The average U.S. diversified equity fund advanced 0.45%, 3.71% and 3.36%. Large-cap growth also did well, while value and alternative strategy funds lagged. By comparison, general U.S. Treasury funds rose 0.25% in June and 0.12% in Q2, for a yearly decline of 2.08%. However, corporate debt funds fell, resulting in the taxable bond fund group's overall decline despite high yield's solid performance.That said, Fidelity's Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer observed that U.S. markets remain in a ""twilight zone. Until January of this year, we had everything going for us: Fairly easy financial conditions and strong earnings growth from the tax cut provided a tremendous tailwind for the market.""However, since January, the market has been in a stalemate, he notes. Tightening liquidity due to rising interest rates and a stronger dollar have been a headwind for the market: ""It's like a tug of war, and the market has been stuck right in the middle of those two opposing tensions.""What Keeps Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Going StrongSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong the largest funds, $85 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index (NAESX) soared 5.07% in June, for a Q2 gain of 6.59%, beating others by a wide margin. The fund holds such growth stocks as network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), financial software provider SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC), design software maker PTC (PTC), domain name marketer GoDaddy (GDDY) and ski resort operator Vail Resorts (MTN), all of which are up between 30% and 46% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity's Timmer says he's seeing a pretty big separation in leadership. As of May, small-caps, which are mostly a pure play on the U.S. domestic economy, ""have broken out and made new highs, while the S&P 500 is still stuck in the trench,"" he said. The S&P 500 index, which has big exposure to foreign markets, rose 0.58%, 3.31% and 2.41% during the one-month, Q2 and H1 periods.He also pointed out that price increases by FAANG stocks, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), accelerated in June and remains very strong. This advance came at the expense of industrials (which did very well last year), and of financial stocks.Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at American Century Investments, says that since the last two months of 2017 and throughout 2018, he's been more cautious on equities: ""Depending on the specific strategy, we either went to a neutral position — that is we weren't going to be overweighting stocks or buying on the dips anymore — or for our more risk-sensitive investors, such as in our target-date retirees entities, we actually moved to underweight equities. It's worked out fairly well for us overall.""Weiss explains that although economic growth continues to accelerate modestly, ""the primary source of that growth has continuously come from the corporate sector, in large part induced by the tax reform and the shot in the arm from the lower corporate tax rates. More importantly, we have not seen the beneficial halo effect for the consumer.""Other warning signs include a number of potentially inflationary pressures on the horizon: rising oil prices, potential wage inflation, accommodative fiscal policy and barriers to trade. ""You add higher interest rates, which are a done deal at this point, then the specter of inflation to an already somewhat muddled outlook for economic growth,"" he said, which results in an environment not that favorable for the stock markets. And while corporate earnings continue to do fairly well, ""they're a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator.""In addition, growth numbers out of Europe, U.K. and Japan have come in weaker, thus dislocating the synchronicity of growth experienced by worldwide markets earlier in the year.For the remainder of 2018, Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust, expects continued volatility and mid-single-digit returns for large-cap stocks. But a recession appears unlikely in the near-term.""Small-cap stock performance has been quite positive of late. This is one of several indicators that leads us to believe a recession is likely not on the horizon anytime soon,"" he said.American Century's Weiss points out that we're in the 10th year of an economic recovery, which is ""more than twice the length of a typical U.S. market cycle — it's pretty long in the tooth.""His message to investors is: ""Whatever you've been doing over the last nine years or so that may have worked for you is likely not to be the same strategy that works for you over the next year or two, because of this potential inflection point. Naively buying on the dips in the stock market works well in a bull market, but it certainly does not in a choppy market or a bear market if that's to come ... It is possible that cash is in the running to be king this year. Cash has a chance of outperforming both stocks and bonds.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIKE ALSO LIKE:What The Stock Market Is Doing Now

295,A,"A migraine prevention treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY) faces an uphill battle against Amgen (AMGN) which, late Thursday, had strong results from long-term studies of its approved medicine.Both Amgen and Lilly have migraine prevention drugs called anti-CGRPs. These drugs work by blocking a specific peptide associated with migraines. Amgen's drug, Aimovig, grabbed approval in May, but Lilly's is fast approaching approval, likely in September.Although Allergan's (AGN) Botox is well known as a treatment for wrinkles and facial lines, it has other uses in excessive sweating, urinary incontinence and to prevent migraines. On Wednesday, Lilly showed that its drug, called Emgality, can benefit patients for whom Botox didn't prevent migraines.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay doesn't expect the study to ""substantially impact positioning in the marketplace.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We do find the post-Botox analysis to provide a unique perspective and marketing point for Emgality with the physicians who have established familiarity with Botox and the estimated 50% of patients that may step through Botox to CGRP therapy,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, Lilly advanced 1% at the closing bell, to 85.49. Amgen sank 0.1%, to 183.34. Shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies each rose a fraction.Late Wednesday, Lilly said Emgality benefited some patients for whom Botox didn't work to prevent migraines.Lilly tested its anti-CGRP at 120-milligram and 240-milligram doses in patients who failed on Botox as a migraine prevention treatment. On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

Since then, shares have gotten as high as 194.20, up 8.5% past the proper entry point.When a stock breaks out, try to buy shares as close as possible to the breakout price, and no more than 5% past this proper entry.You don't want to buy shares too high in price ahead of a potential normal pullback.While Wall Street's consensus estimates for full-year fiscal 2018 earnings growth have been shaved a bit, they're still robust.Analysts think Apple will grow FY 2018 profit by 25% to $11.49 a share. The fiscal year ends in September. For the June-ended fiscal third quarter, the Street sees profit up 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% rise in the top line to $52.29 billion. That bottom-line estimate tops the megacap tech's past results over nearly three years.Earnings fell for three quarters in a row through fiscal Q4 in 2016, then rebounded 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16% and 30% in the past six quarters.

For a company that logged $229.2 billion in sales for FY 2017 and is the largest company in the U.S. financial markets with a $936 billion market value, such a rating is not shabby at all.However, all of the leaders making the IBD Big Cap 20 screen show Composite scores of 94 to 99.

299,A,"Dow Jones futures rose Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, on crude oil, China and Germany. On Monday, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite erased early losses to close higher. On the flip side, Tesla stock looked strong before and just after the opening bell on Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 production, but reversed to close lower. Facebook stock fell modestly late as it confirmed that more federal agencies are probing the social giant's data sharing practices. Meanwhile, recent hot IPOs Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Chinese livestreaming stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) are trying to find support after sharp pullbacks.Dow Jones futures rose 0.6% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.7%.U.S. crude oil futures rose more than 1%, approaching $75 a barrel. Iran admitted renewed U.S. sanctions will hurt exports while Libya supply woes returned. China's Shanghai composite stemmed a slide as China's central bank talked up a falling yuan. The benchmark Chinese index is in a bear market. Finally, European stocks rallied as German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached an immigration compromise with Bavarian rebels who threatened her long-running reign.Remember that U.S. markets close early today, at 1 p.m. ET, and are closed for the 4th of July.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The focus is on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and whether public Facebook statements have been truthful.Facebook stock rose 1.6% to 197.36 in Monday's stock market trading. That's at the edge of a 5% chase zone from a 188.42 buy point.Tesla stock action Monday offered a trio of key investing lessons.Be wary of overnight trading: Trading after the close and before the open often doesn't translate into how a stock will close in the next session. Tesla rose more 6% than in premarket trade and shortly after the opening bell. That came on news that Tesla Model 3 production topped 5,000 in the last week of June, the first time the electric vehicle maker hit that weekly milestone. But Tesla stock quickly pared gains, and by the close fell 2.3% to 335.07. Some analysts wondered if Tesla Model 3 output was sustainable.Likewise, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all pointed lower before Monday open, but the actual indexes rallied for slim-to-solid gains.For what it's worth, Tesla stock fell 0.9% in Tuesday's premarket.Good news sometimes spurs selling: ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is an old stock market saying that doesn't always hold up. But the stock market does a good job of pricing in good news, especially if that news is expected. Tesla stock had rallied strongly in late May to June 18 as CEO Elon Musk predicted Model 3 output would hit 5,000 in the last week of June.Given that Musk's promises often don't hold up, it wasn't surprising to see Tesla stock rally early Monday. But ultimately the ""sell the news"" trend took hold.Wait for a proper buy point: Even at the Tesla stock intraday peak of 364.78, it was still well below a 373.83 handle buy point. When a stock clears a buy point, the odds are high that it will rise, and rise strongly. That's no guarantee, but you make big money bets when the odds are in your favor.Tesla stock also reflects a fourth investing lesson over the long run.Focus on the very best stocks: Tesla has a Composite Rating of just 38 out of a possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs. That reflects Tesla's significant losses and recent poor, sluggish share price performance. Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for nearly a year. The RS line really hasn't made headway for more than four years.Obviously, Tesla stock has been a big winner, from its April 2013 breakout to the end of February 2014. Perhaps the company is turning the corner in terms of production and cash burn. If so, the stock may be a big winner. But investors generally should focus on the best of the best of the best.Pivotal Software is a Dell spinoff. Its cloud-based service helps companies streamline software development and manage apps. Huya, a spinoff of YY (YY), is the leading Chinese streaming site for video games. IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, is called the ""Netflix of China.""Pivotal stock is finding support right at its 20-day line after the April IPO blasted higher in early June but then pulled back.The Chinese livestreaming IPOs have been consolidating for a few days before their 20-day lines, after significant pullbacks. Huya stock and iQiyi stock had skyrocketed in June, becoming sharply extended from their 10-day moving lines. That made a near-term retreat likely.On Monday, Pivotal stock rose 1.8% to 24.70. iQiyi stock rose 1.55% to 32.80. Huya stock sank 2.4% to 32.10, but held above a recent near-term low and closed near session highs.Early Tuesday, iQiyi stock and Huya stock rose 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Pivotal stock was not yet active.But it's early days for these stocks. Just because a stock has stopped falling for a few days, or even begun to move higher, doesn't mean it's a buy. Wait for a stock to consolidate and blast out of a new buy point.Just look at Brazilian IPO PagSeguro (PAGS). The payments stock rocketed from early February to late March. Then shares pulled back to the 50-day line and tried to bounce back. But within a few days PagSeguro stock broke down sharply.

On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

301,A,"If you haven't had a colonoscopy, you're not missing much, except a chance to save your life.Colon and rectal cancer rates are soaring among young and middle-aged adults. In response to the alarming data, last week the American Cancer Society called for screening beginning at age 45, instead of waiting to 50. And they recommend getting tested even sooner if you have bowel problems. Adults born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer as people born in 1950.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is pushing back on earlier screening and many health insurers are likely to deny covering it. That's a mistake. Some 16,450 patients under age 50 are expected to get a colon or rectal cancer diagnosis in the coming year. A colonoscopy every 10 years reduces the danger of dying from colorectal cancer by 67%.But be careful where you get the procedure.Infection risk from contaminated equipment is a hundred times what the medical community previously thought, according to a Johns Hopkins and McKinsey & Co. investigation in the current issue of the medical journal Gut. An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 patients a year are getting infected from dirty scopes. The scope — a tube with a camera and light on the end — is complicated to clean. Worse, in many health care institutions, the staff get careless.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew research in the American Journal of Infection Control documents technicians cleaning soiled scopes and then handling clean scopes without changing gloves, wiping down scopes with used towels, and turning off reprocessing machines before the cleaning is complete to ""save time.""An ominous 71% of scopes used on a variety of procedures, including colonoscopies, tested positive for bacteria. The bacteria were not killer superbugs, but these findings are a red flag. Since 2013, at least 35 patients have died from superbug infections traced to especially complex, hard to clean scopes called duodenoscopes. Inadequate cleaning is a broader problem — affecting scopes of all types.Infection rates after colonoscopies vary widely from one outpatient center to another and one hospital to another. Before deciding where to have a colonoscopy, you can check with your state health department website or the federal website Hospital Compare, to see safety data for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.Don't let infection risk or the yuck factor of sitting on the toilet for hours emptying your colon before the test dissuade you from getting screened. Colorectal cancer is the second-biggest cancer killer for men, and the third-biggest for women. When diagnosed early, when the cancer is local, it is 90% curable, but patients diagnosed with late-stage disease have only a 14% chance of living five years. That's happening to many young people.Dr. John L. Marshall of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center says he expected his patients would be elderly. ""All of a sudden I have a bunch of young people, young adults, in my clinic with colon cancer.""Why the rising danger? Scientists don't know all the reasons. But obesity is a major factor, according to Massachusetts General Hospital findings unveiled last week. Adult women who gain even just 17 pounds or more after age 18 are more likely to get colon cancer than women who manage to stay close to their teenage weight.One-third of patients diagnosed with it before 35 have a hereditary form of the disease, says Eduardo Vilar-Sanchez of Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. Family history is a good reason to get screened at an early age.Looking ahead, researchers are developing a blood test to identify who has precancerous polyps in their colon, making colonoscopies unnecessary.Meantime, the American Cancer Society and other advocates should push hard for cleanliness in hospitals and outpatient facilities to minimize infection risk from a colonoscopy. Worries about dirty instruments shouldn't scare patients away from getting the test they need to beat colon cancer.Other columns by Betsy McCaugheyMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

302,A,"The fast-growing $3.6 trillion U.S. market for exchange-traded funds is closer to getting a shot in the arm after Wall Street's main regulator advanced a proposal for streamlining its approval process for the products.The Securities and Exchange Commission plan approved for public comment on Thursday would make it easier to bring new ETFs to market by laying out formal steps for setting up less-complicated funds. The change would eliminate the need for many issuers to seek a special order from the SEC to allow funds to operate. Commissioners voted 5-0 to release the proposal for public comment.The mutual fund industry has long complained about the wait and cost associated with getting the regulator to sign off on new funds, while critics say the current system based on one-off approvals gives advantages to more established firms. The SEC tried to address the issue in 2008, before shelving a plan that aimed to ""eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens"" as it focused attention on dealing with the global financial crisis.""The proposed rule would cover most ETFs operating today and all similar ETFs that sponsors may seek to launch in the future,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said before the vote. Replacing the current exemptive orders under which many products operate would ""level the playing field,"" he said.Clayton said the new rule wouldn't cover all products and that some would continue to require greater scrutiny. Complex, leveraged products wouldn't be eligible for the streamlined process.In her prepared remarks, Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein noted that the rule wouldn't cover so-called share-class ETFs, such as those run by Vanguard Group, which are structured as a separate class of a mutual fund. It will however give issuers greater choice about which securities they admit to the fund and which they give out — something the industry had called for.Clayton has made passing an ETF rule a priority since he took the helm at the SEC in May 2017. He hired Dalia Blass, who worked on the 2008 proposal, to lead the agency's investment management unit and listed the rule as a key part of his regulatory agenda.While ETFs started as a way for investors to buy into indexes like the S&P 500 and pay minimal fees and taxes, investors now can purchase funds that employ strategies such as leverage and short selling or focus on narrow, thinly-traded market sectors.The streamlined process the SEC proposed would target so-called plain vanilla ETFs, leaving firms wishing to list more complex products to seek approvals through the more laborious approach the regulator currently uses.Two top officials at the SEC are sounding the alarm over leveraged ETFs — even as the agency looks to streamline sales of simpler ETFs.Robert Jackson Jr., who holds a Democratic seat on the SEC, criticized a failure to address these ""dangerous"" funds in a proposed rule that would make it easier to bring plain-vanilla ETFs to market. Meanwhile, Stein posed a series of questions about who these products are appropriate for, and what their impact is on underlying markets. Leveraged ETFs ""pose real risks to American families,"" Jackson said. ""I'm worried that many investors are going to find out — too late — exactly how dangerous those products can sometimes be.""The funds in question are called ""leveraged"" because they hold derivatives that deliver a juiced-up form of their strategy to improve the performance of their portfolio. For example, the popular ProShares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO) uses these securities with the goal of providing twice the daily performance of the S&P 500 Index. Roughly 1% of the $3.5 trillion of assets in exchange-traded products is invested in leveraged vehicles, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Clayton, a political independent who was named by President Trump, said after the meeting that he was talking with Jackson about the issue. He indicated that the products could possibly be addressed as part of sweeping new conduct rules the agency has proposed for brokers and investment advisors. Any new regulation regarding the funds would require Clayton's support.""Leveraged ETFs and similar complex products are ones that you need to go through a lot of work to ensure that that type of product is appropriate for your customer,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Apple, Tech Stocks Rebound As Nasdaq Leads AdvanceAre These 3 Market-Beating Tech Stock Plays Setting Up?Why Are These Top Stock Plays Trouncing The Market?

305,A,"PolarityTE (COOL) stock tumbled again Tuesday after losing more than a quarter of its value a day earlier when a short-seller called it a ""fraud"" based on allegations tied to its patent application.On the stock market today, PolarityTE sank 6.2% to close at 26.41. Earlier, the stock was down as much as 14.4%. The dive followed Monday's 27.3% plunge, which came after Citron Research called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the skin-replacement specialist.Short-seller Citron says PolarityTE should have notified investors when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a non-final rejection of an application to patent its SkinTE technology on March 31, 2017. The office later issued a final rejection on June 4, 2018, according to USPTO filings.PolarityTE, on the other hand, says it's still prosecuting against multiple patent applications — a legal process that involves negotiating with the USPTO for a patent. The application Citron noted is one of three pending applications, the company told Investor's Business Daily in an email Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThis is ""part of a routine process that can span several years,"" the firm said in a written statement. ""The office action is expected to be responded to within three months.""PolarityTE went public through a reverse merger with gaming company Majesco Entertainment in April 2017. Two months later it sold all gaming assets. Today, the firm is working on SkinTE, a rival to traditional skin-graft technology.Investor's Business Daily interviewed Chief Executive Denver Lough in May. An IBD article on June 18 focused on the technology, which removes an entire ""village"" of supportive cellular elements to regrow full-thickness skin for burn victims and to lessen the visibility of scars.For the article, IBD asked to interview an expert familiar with the technology. A spokesperson for the company connected IBD with Dr. Mark Granick, a professor and chief of plastic surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.Both the company and Granick failed to disclose that Granick is a paid member of PolarityTE's clinical board of advisors. That fact is listed on PolarityTE's website, but isn't listed on Granick's public profile with the medical school.A spokesperson for the company told IBD in a follow-up email that advisory boards are normal for biotech and medtech companies.""These are small companies that seek input from those in research of clinical practice,"" the spokesperson said. ""I know that we didn't present Granick as someone other than (one) of the first users of the product who can talk about his experiences.""The article has since been removed from IBD's Investors.com website.Citron describes itself as a stock commentary website. It has previously published negative reports on fellow med-tied firms Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG), as well as bigger tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).The website cautions it usually has a short position in the securities it profiles.

347,A,"Beer giant Molson Coors (TAP) is reportedly considering whether to offer marijuana-infused drinks via a partnership with a Canadian marijuana producer. An analyst said such a move would give Molson ""meaningful exposure"" to the North American cannabis market and some of the biggest marijuana stocks.A cannabis push could echo attempts by rival Constellation Brands (STZ) to head off the plant's perceived threat to alcohol sales. And it could accelerate the race of U.S. companies into Canada — and Canadian companies into the U.S. — following a vote in Canada last week to legalize recreational marijuana.Molson Coors has held talks with companies as Aurora Cannabis and Aphria, according to BNN Bloomberg. The brewer has been exploring whether to ""invest in (the companies) and collaborate on future cannabis-infused beverages,"" the report said. Molson has been in talks with the those companies and others over the past six months, the report said.A Molson spokesman, when reached for comment, said ""we don't comment on rumor or market speculation."" Aurora Cannabis was not immediately available for comment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast year, Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter said the company had a team to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the marijuana industry. Molson this spring told IBD that it was ""working actively"" to understand cannabis' potential impacts on its business, and would ""take our time and get it right.""A few weeks ago, at the company's Investor Day, Hunter said ""we have assembled a team in Canada to actively explore the risks and opportunities of entering the cannabis space in that market, where it will be federally legal by this fall.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that recreational legalization will take hold on Oct. 17. Legalization of edibles and other ingestibles — which have grown in popularity — will come later.U.S.-traded marijuana stocks, like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON), jumped after Canadian lawmakers approved the legislation, but then sold off Friday.Marijuana stocks retreated on Monday. Canopy Growth, which began trading in the U.S. in late May, sank 5.1% in the stock market today. Cronos stock, which began trading in the U.S. in February, slid 4.7%.

ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ), an exchange-traded fund with exposure to the marijuana industry, retreated 2.8%, piercing its 200-day line.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Friday, said any Molson Coors move into the cannabis industry by Molson would likely resemble the one Constellation made with Canopy Growth last year.In that deal, Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in Canopy to help ""identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics."" The companies also agreed to share ""knowledge and expertise."" Constellation aims to collaborate with Canopy on cannabis-infused drinks.Andy Thomas, the CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose brands include Red Hook, told IBD this spring he would consider making or selling cannabis drinks if pot were federally legalized.On Friday, Constellation Brands, which sells Corona Beer as well as other alcoholic beverages, reports quarterly earnings.Constellation Brands stock fell 1.5% Monday. Molson Coors stock rose 1.1%.Azer said the report from Bloomberg was not a surprise. She said that Molson Coors ""has meaningful exposure to the North American cannabis market (as the No. 2 participant in beer in both Canada and the U.S.).""She also said that a potential partnership with Aurora or Aphria ""makes sense to us as they are two of the more sizable competitors in the market.""

Rapidly draining American surpluses are compounding real and envisioned supply interruptions in Canada, Iran, Venezuela and North Africa. Inventories stowed at the biggest U.S. pipeline hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, plunged more than 8 percent last week, the deepest cut since early February.""You had a very significant, almost overwhelming draw in Cushing,"" said Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group LLC in Wellington, Florida. ""Nothing is getting better in Venezuela, Libya or Iran. The market's got to go up.""Prices also moved higher as weakness in the dollar increased the appeal of commodities priced in the greenback.The U.S. benchmark crude has rallied more than 7 percent this week despite OPEC's pledge to relax production caps that eroded a worldwide glut. The U.S. is pushing allies to halt purchases of Iranian crude as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to punish the Islamic Republic for its nuclear program. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia plans to pump a record amount of crude next month.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery increased 69 cents to settle at $73.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since November 2014.Brent futures for August settlement advanced 23 cents to end the session at $77.85 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

In response, Midwest refiners probably are drawing on Gulf Coast crude supplies to offset the losses from Canada, said Paul Crovo, a Philadelphia-based analyst at PNC Capital Advisors LLC.In Libya, a militia leader handed over control of some of the country's biggest crude-exporting terminals to a rival of the Tripoli-based state oil company.

351,A,"In America, most moviegoers must have a bag of popcorn while watching. In growth stocks, what's the one thing you must have for an outstanding breakout?Volume. Lots of it.If the amount of shares traded on breakout day, or a few days afterward, surges well above normal levels, your confidence in the stock should grow. As a stock bolts out of a good double bottom or other type of base, heavy turnover means this: The big guns on Wall Street are accumulating shares big time. They're willing to pay up.What are ""normal levels?""IBD calculates a 50-day average daily share volume and plots it as a thin red line on daily charts. So you can quickly see if volume was heavy, flat or light on any trading day. Just compare the height of the volume bar for that day with the 50-day line itself.At Investors.com, open up a daily chart and click on any price-and-volume bar. A pop-up data box shows the volume that day and how it compares with average volume. Ideally, volume on the breakout day should be at least 40% above the 50-day average. For small and midcap stocks, volume might double, triple or even quadruple.Texas Instruments (TXN) flashed a picture-perfect breakout on Sept. 15.After peaking on June 9 of last year at 84.65 (1), the semiconductor play cooled off for three weeks, hitting bottom at 75.92. The 10.3% drop from head to toe was unusually shallow for a typical cup with handle. Yet, it carved the pattern well. Notice how the nearly four weeks up in price, formed the cup's right side. The handle was also quite long, but it showed a dry-up in volume (2). Note the bullish support along the 50-day moving average.On the breakout, the market was in a confirmed uptrend. (Always check in the Big Picture column). TI rallied 1.9% and rolled past the 84.34 buy point (10 cents above the handle's highest price). See how the volume bar soared well above the 50-day moving average line (3)? Mutual funds, banks, pension funds and the like furiously snatched shares. Turnover soared 154% above its average 4.06 million shares to 10.3 million.TI briefly pulled back three days later in above-average trade (4), but it paled vs. the breakout volume. Plus, the Dallas-based firm held above the proper buy point. No reason to sell.Could you have viewed TI's base as a flat base as well? No problem. With an 84.75 buy point, the breakout day was the same.Want an easy way to discover future breakouts? Check IBD's Stocks On The Move table.

352,A,"California's coffee may not necessitate a cancer warning after all.The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), the office that oversees Proposition 65, recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that could effectively exempt coffee from Prop 65's onerous requirements.In OEHHA's own words: ""Exposures to Proposition 65-listed chemicals in coffee that are produced as part of and inherent in the processes of roasting coffee beans and brewing coffee pose no significant risk of cancer.""OEHHA is correct to side with science. According to the federal government's own dietary guidelines, moderate coffee consumption is not only ""(un)associated with an increased risk of major chronic diseases (e.g. cancer),"" but it can actually be incorporated into healthy living styles to ""maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe World Health Organization dropped coffee from its list of possible carcinogens two years ago, noting that moderate coffee consumption can actually lower cancer risk because coffee beans contain healthy antioxidants. As Dana Loomis, an official at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), explained at the time, ""There is less reason for concern today than there was before.""IARC's optimism is justified by the latest empirical evidence. Most recently, two studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine tracked the coffee intake of more than 600,000 individuals over 16 years. Researchers concluded that coffee drinkers experience lower risk of death from heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, stroke, and — you guessed it — even cancer.Coffee remains on Prop 65's list of flagged substances because of acrylamide, a flavorless chemical naturally produced when coffee beans are roasted. Although mega-doses of acrylamide have been linked to cancer in rodents, the National Cancer Institute has found ""no consistent evidence that dietary acrylamide exposure is associated with the risk of any type of cancer"" in human beings.The fact that coffee remains on the target list — in the face of overwhelming evidence — is a testament to Prop 65's longstanding overreach. The law requires warnings for nearly 900 individual chemicals, many of which arguably have no demonstrable link to cancer. Indeed, the American Cancer Society notes that ""not every compound labeled as a possible cancer-causing substance has been proven to the worldwide scientific community to actually cause cancer.""Prop 65 warning signs would impose onerous labeling requirements on small and large businesses that are located in both California and across our country, who supply coffee to California businesses, their customers, and workers. Mandated warning signage also leaves them vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits, which eventually raises costs for the end consumer.The financial fallout from a Prop 65 violation ranges from $2,500 a day per violation — such as improper warning notices — to product recalls and the payment of plaintiff's attorney fees. Since the law's inception in 1986, roughly 20,000 Prop 65-related lawsuits have been filed against small businesses, which have been forced to pay out more than $500 million in settlements.This diverts resources to court dates and legal fees, when they should be spent powering Californians with freshly brewed coffee, as well as creating jobs and more inspiring, productive work environments.Prop 65 threatens California's entire convenience services industry, whose vendors bring coffee — as well as tea, water, fresh food, and more — to employers and employees throughout the Golden State. In California, the convenience services industry delivers well over $700 million in total economic impact, employing more than 3,600 service operators, machine manufacturers, and brokers whom would be negatively impacted by an overreach of Prop 65 into coffee regulation.Why hassle employers with Prop 65 regulations that have no basis in science?If anything, warning labels on coffee beans desensitize Californians to the real health risks posed by other substances. As the Los Angeles Times editorial board recently concluded: ""The measure is so broad, its warnings may actually make it harder for Californians to assess the real dangers they encounter.""OEHHA should move forward with relieving coffee of its Prop 65 burden once and for all. Protect us from actual carcinogens, and leave consumers' coffee alone.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

353,A,"Recent days in the global Trump trade war have seen President Donald Trump go to bat to save Chinese tech jobs, while Harley-Davidson (HOG) shifts some production out of the U.S.The cognitive dissonance doesn't end there. Trump has lashed out at Canada for its high tariffs on dairy products. That's despite American dairy farmers pleading with Trump to lift steel tariffs on Mexico, or else Mexicans will cut U.S. cheese out of their diets. Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs will sap demand for its Alabama-made SUVs, while Trump threatened to hit imported German luxury cars with a 20% tax.The Trump trade war is full of contradictions that are partly a function of fighting on so many fronts. The end result looks likely to undermine U.S. interests, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs, while playing into the hands of America's top trade adversary: China.Trump wants to bend the rules of trade to get foreign manufacturers to produce goods for Americans in the U.S., attacking American companies for deciding to set up shop overseas to meet local demand. Yet Trump is shooting himself in the foot. Retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners and Trump's own tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising the cost of doing business here.Trump accused Harley-Davidson of waving the ""white flag"" after the motorcycle maker said Europe's extra 25% tariff on American-made Harleys — in retaliation for Trump's tariffs — would add about $2,200 to the cost of each motorcycle.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump argued that U.S. companies that stay strong will be rewarded when trading partners like the EU scrap their tariffs, including a 6% duty on Harleys. But companies have no reason to think Trump's strategy will work. While German carmakers are willing to give up a 10% tariff on imports, they're demanding that Trump cancel a decades-old 25% U.S. tax on imported SUVs and pickup trucks.Even when the U.S. could take the principled high ground, Trump is alienating U.S. allies and acting as if economic might makes right.Trump wasn't wrong in calling out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the country's dairy tariffs of 270%, yet the U.S. has its own sacred cows, so to speak. Overall, Canada has among the lowest tariffs in the world, even slightly lower than the U.S., according to the World Bank.Meanwhile, Trump's steel tariffs on Canada are so out of bounds that even the United Steelworkers union has called for Trump to drop the tariffs. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017. Yet, it's also the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers, importing 4.8 million metric tons. Trump tariffs ignore the latter.Harley-Davidson is hardly the only U.S. company mulling layoffs as collateral damage from the Trump trade war. Mid-Continent Nail of Missouri has reportedly laid off 60 workers and could cut hundreds more if it can't get an exemption from Trump steel tariffs that make its wares uncompetitive.Some 20,000 companies have sought exclusions. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that fewer than 100 had been processed, with 42 accepted and 56 denied. Sixteen jobs could be lost for every steel and aluminum job added thanks to tariffs, a study by the Trade Partnerships Worldwide consultancy estimated.The latest survey of regional manufacturers by the Kansas City Fed found plenty of criticism of the Trump trade war. Statements from business owners included this: ""Bracing for the worst concerning China tariffs. We will move the last of manufacturing offshore. Loss of business due to tariffs will have a larger impact than interest rates.""Trump's tariffs on Chinese high-tech-related imports, due to take effect starting July 6, would make U.S. multinationals less competitive.How? Rather than target mostly finished goods that U.S. consumers buy from Chinese companies, the Trump tariffs hit so-called intermediate goods. U.S. companies import them from China to incorporate in finished U.S. products, which then become pricier vs. rivals.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang.President Xi Jinping's Made In China 2025 agenda aims to close the technological gap and end the dependence on advanced tech from non-Chinese companies. But that's an aspiration, the researchers noted, while current Chinese tech still lags that of the U.S. and others.""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""The Semiconductor Industry Association says much the same thing: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""The chief Trump trade war target is China, which has a $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S., limits market access and systematically conspires to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.The U.S. could try to isolate Beijing by creating a broad united front to keep China honest or make it pay a price. This is what President Obama had in mind with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But four days into his term, Trump scrapped that 12-nation trade deal, which included intellectual property protections. This spring he briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that is at the root of Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump has picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.If the biggest trade threat to the U.S. is China and its world-dominating tech ambitions, why is Trump out to save 70,000 jobs at Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE?Trump decided last month to overturn Commerce Department sanctions against ZTE that banned key U.S. component suppliers from doing business with the firm, forcing it to cease operations.This week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Instead, Trump backed legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Trump could have gone as far as banning chip equipment sales to Chinese firms, Moody's said this week. That would have been a bitter pill for Xi and could have derailed trade talks.Trump appears to view America's big trade deficit as low-hanging fruit for an easy trade-war win. He largely declared victory a month ago, when China agreed to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.That may explain why the Trump trade war appears to be more diplomatic with China than with traditional U.S. allies.With no allies to join in pressuring China to change its state-subsidized technology strategy, Trump seems to be settling for low-hanging fruit. He appears to be taking a softer line on export controls, pushing the seemingly inevitable technological cold war with China down the road.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenDow Jones Futures Try To Rally: This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

354,A,"Beer giant Molson Coors (TAP) is reportedly considering whether to offer marijuana-infused drinks via a partnership with a Canadian marijuana producer. An analyst said such a move would give Molson ""meaningful exposure"" to the North American cannabis market and some of the biggest marijuana stocks.A cannabis push could echo attempts by rival Constellation Brands (STZ) to head off the plant's perceived threat to alcohol sales. And it could accelerate the race of U.S. companies into Canada — and Canadian companies into the U.S. — following a vote in Canada last week to legalize recreational marijuana.Molson Coors has held talks with companies as Aurora Cannabis and Aphria, according to BNN Bloomberg. The brewer has been exploring whether to ""invest in (the companies) and collaborate on future cannabis-infused beverages,"" the report said. Molson has been in talks with the those companies and others over the past six months, the report said.A Molson spokesman, when reached for comment, said ""we don't comment on rumor or market speculation."" Aurora Cannabis was not immediately available for comment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast year, Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter said the company had a team to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the marijuana industry. Molson this spring told IBD that it was ""working actively"" to understand cannabis' potential impacts on its business, and would ""take our time and get it right.""A few weeks ago, at the company's Investor Day, Hunter said ""we have assembled a team in Canada to actively explore the risks and opportunities of entering the cannabis space in that market, where it will be federally legal by this fall.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that recreational legalization will take hold on Oct. 17. Legalization of edibles and other ingestibles — which have grown in popularity — will come later.U.S.-traded marijuana stocks, like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON), jumped after Canadian lawmakers approved the legislation, but then sold off Friday.Marijuana stocks retreated on Monday. Canopy Growth, which began trading in the U.S. in late May, sank 5.1% in the stock market today. Cronos stock, which began trading in the U.S. in February, slid 4.7%. But it's still above its 50-day line. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ), an exchange-traded fund with exposure to the marijuana industry, retreated 2.8%, piercing its 200-day line.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Friday, said any Molson Coors move into the cannabis industry by Molson would likely resemble the one Constellation made with Canopy Growth last year.In that deal, Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in Canopy to help ""identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics."" The companies also agreed to share ""knowledge and expertise."" Constellation aims to collaborate with Canopy on cannabis-infused drinks.Andy Thomas, the CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose brands include Red Hook, told IBD this spring he would consider making or selling cannabis drinks if pot were federally legalized.On Friday, Constellation Brands, which sells Corona Beer as well as other alcoholic beverages, reports quarterly earnings.Constellation Brands stock fell 1.5% Monday. Molson Coors stock rose 1.1%.Azer said the report from Bloomberg was not a surprise. She said that Molson Coors ""has meaningful exposure to the North American cannabis market (as the No. 2 participant in beer in both Canada and the U.S.).""She also said that a potential partnership with Aurora or Aphria ""makes sense to us as they are two of the more sizable competitors in the market.""

This represents an acceleration in growth after the Cupertino, Calif., company increased earnings by 11% to $9.21 in FY 2017.Earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter are seen rising 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% boost in revenue to $52.27 billion as the company expands its digital revenue and gains more traction in new products such as new editions of the Apple Watch.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Do You Know This Key Sell Signal For Both Stocks And ETFs?Which Way Is The Market Headed Now?

356,A,"Dow Jones futures tumbled Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump said he has instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to identify another $200 billion in Chinese goods for tariffs, ratcheting up the U.S.-China trade war. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures also retreated.The Dow Jones industrial average fell for a fifth straight session on Monday on China trade war fears, while the S&P 500 index dipped. But the Nasdaq composite edged higher, just below record levels. Several techs broke out Monday, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Box (BOX), Autodesk (ADSK) and recent China IPO Sogou (SOGO).President Trump late Monday said in a White House statement that the 10% duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods would go forward if Beijing doesn't change its ""unfair practices"" and ""insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced,"" the president said in a statement provided by the White House late on Monday.Trump added that if China retaliates against those duties, the U.S. would impose duties on yet another $200 billion in Chinese goods.On Friday, the U.S. said it would slap a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese imports, with some $34 billion kicking in on July 6. That same day, China said it would impose $34 billion in retaliatory tariffs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The megacap tech remains close to testing a 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double bottom. The iPhone giant broke out of that narrow base on May 4, then rallied 8.5% over the next several weeks to reach a new all-time high of 194.20.Apple, however, is now in danger of erasing those mild gains.

362,A,"Stocks staged a solid open Wednesday, as the Trump Administration eased some China-trade threats, and strong gains across Europe halted a sell-off begun earlier in China. The morning's backdrop showed China's bear market worsening, and oil prices rising as markets assessed whether U.S. sanctions threatened against buyers of Iranian oil had opened a new chapter in the global trade war.China trade-sensitive names Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) vied with oil names Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to lead the Dow. ""Smackdown"" owner World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scored one of the market's strongest early wins. Conagra (CAG) fell hardest among S&P 500 stocks, after announcing its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods (PF).The Nasdaq Composite popped 0.4% at the start of trade. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gained 0.3%.Markets in the U.S. and Europe strengthened after the Trump Administration backed away from threats to use executive authority to impose sweeping restrictions on China-based companies investing in U.S. technologies and businesses. Instead, news reports quoted senior administration officials saying the administration would rely on Congress to update existing laws, rather than assessing arbitrary restrictions based on national security threats.The official said the White House would work with Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. rules, in a way that ""maintains the open investment climate"" in the U.S. That was a sharp change in tone from Monday's announcement that the administration would seek to halt further technology exports to China and block targeted Chinese investments in U.S. technology firms.On the Dow, Caterpillar and Boeing rose in tandem, up 1.7% apiece.  Caterpillar has fallen in nine of the past 10 sessions, Boeing has dropped in eight of the past 11 days. Both stocks have broken below key levels of technical support, causing significant damage to their base-building efforts.Exxon and Chevron (CVX) were also among the Dow's early leaders, up 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively, as oil prices jumped to six-week highs. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday threatened sanctions against countries and companies who failed to end purchases of Iranian oil by November. Oil also was squeezed higher by industry data showing a 9.2 million barrel draw on inventories in the week ended June 22. Economists had projected a 2.6 million barrel decrease. Official weekly supply numbers are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude vaulted 1.5% higher, to near $72 a barrel, in early trade.Conagra opened 6.8% lower — and Pinnacle Foods fell 4.1% — after Conagra said it would acquire the Parsippany, N.J.-based competitor in a cash/stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. Conagra owns the Chef Boyardee, Marie Callendar's and Healthy Choice Brands. Pinnacle's brands include Bird's Eye, Duncan Hines and Mrs. Paul's.The loss sent Pinnacle back below a 66.76 buy point in a 12-month saucer base. Conagra's tumble sent shares below their 10- and 40-week moving averages, snuffing a long-term basing effort.Also in the packaged food space, General Mills (GIS) notched an early 0.7% advance. The Minneapolis-based owner of Cheerios, Wheaties and Betty Crocker reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Revenue met analyst targets, and company management issued upside full-year earnings guidance.World Wrestling Entertainment jack-hammered an 6.7% gain in opening trade. The Stamford, Conn.-based company announced a five-year deal placing its ""Monday Night Raw"" program on Comcast's (CMCSA) USA channel, and its ""Smackdown"" series on Fox Networks on Friday nights. The company said the deal would more than triple the annual value of its U.S. distribution rights. WWE shares are up 132% since the start of the year,In other earnings news, AeroVironment shook of its premarket loss and traded with narrow gains. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain that eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones remained in a buy range, after breaking out on Tuesday past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume.Drive-in burger joint Sonic (SONC) tanked 9.6%. The Oklahoma City, Okla.-based chain reported, after Tuesday's close, fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings narrowly above analyst consensus targets. Same-store-sales and drive-in margins declined, and management trimmed is full-year earnings guidance. The dive narrowed Sonic's gain from a June 7 breakout to 8%.China's markets rebooted Monday's sell-off as the yuan slid below the 6.6-per-dollar level, a key technical level. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1%, digging deeper into bear market territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index swooned 1.8%, putting it more than 15% below its February high.Japan managed to buffer the selling somewhat. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 held to a 0.3% decline, despite the yen's safe-haven advance vs. the dollar.Stocks in Europe shook off early losses and rallied in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 jumped 1.1%, Frankfurt's DAX leapt 1.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris surged 1.4% higher.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Stocks Bounce Modestly But Hold At Key Levels; 3 Rules For A Weaker MarketStock Futures Fall; 4 Trade-War Resistant Watchlist StocksThis Dividend Stock And Gas Pipeline Play Faces Big Q2 ExpectationsIBD Stock Of The Day Forms New Base After 62% RunTime To Buy This China Growth Stock Again?

That offers bullish confirmation PayPal's breakout attempt.PayPal previously cleared a flattish double-bottom-base entry of 84.09 last month, but the move came in light volume, which is not a great sign.Wednesday's rally also appears to be on below-average trade.Analysts said Wednesday that PayPal is gaining scale against rivals such as Square (SQ) thanks to recent acquisitions. PayPal on Tuesday said it would buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million. In May, PayPal agreed to buy iZettle, a European mobile-payment rival to Square and others, for $2.2 billion.A key to PayPal stock's ongoing success is its stellar fundamentals.

369,A,"Baozun, a May 2015 new issue, has waged a terrific run-up ever since it cleared a super-deep bottoming base at 9.99 during the week ended Aug. 26, 2016. How long can its rally last?And more importantly, how much impact could the China-U.S. trade dispute have on the company's fundamentals?To answer the first question, it's really key to learn how to count bases.After a stock breaks out of a sound chart pattern, watch to see if rises 20% or more. If it does, the next serious decline begins the process of a new base.What if a stock rises just 15% from the proper buy point, then settles into a new base? Put another way: You find a stock that launches out of a cup with handle, breaks out, goes up 15%, but then forms a flat base on top of that cup? In most cases, both bases count as one entire base. IBD calls it simply a base on base.Going back to Baozun (BZUN), the stock nearly doubled in price and hit all-time highs after that first breakout in 2016. Base No. 2 was also quite deep, but Baozun cleared a 17.68 entry during the week ended May 5, 2017. That breakout spawned a 130% advance.Baozun formed two more bases, one from September 2017 and another from March 2018. These two bases showed big weekly price swings. But the breakout from these bases showed hefty volume, a good sign.Some late-stage breakouts can work, even if there's higher risk of failure, when a company has truly excellent fundamentals and solid institutional sponsorship.This week, the stock has fallen to the 10-week moving average for the first time since its May 17 breakout. A first or second rebound off the 10-week line offers investors a fresh opportunity to buy shares. Risk is higher now with the market's outlook downgraded by IBD on Monday to ""uptrend under pressure.""During a rally off the 10-week line, look for a swell in turnover. A strong price gain in heavy volume signals solid institutional demand. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, or in this case, near 55.70.Contrast Baozun's action to fellow Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW). The latter dropped briefly below its 50-day moving average on Friday, then closed beneath the line on Monday. Volume hasn't been overly intense, however. On Monday, ServiceNow saw trading volume increase merely 3% above average.To answer the second question, on the U.S.-China trade dispute, it's key to study recent numbers.Baozun, the expert in e-commerce markets in the second largest economy, has superior earnings gains. According to IBD Leaderboard, the average EPS increase over the past three quarters is 58%.

373,A,"In any given year, there's no shortage of conferences for advisors. The big question is whether to attend, given the time and expense.Sponsored by professional associations, financial services firms, tech suppliers and other groups, these multiday conferences often feature prominent speakers, training workshops and vendor booths. Advisors may also get continuing education credit for attending certain programs.Advisors rarely take the decision to attend lightly. Because they often need to travel long distances, they miss opportunities to confer with clients and run their operation if they're out of the office.""It costs you money to go, the time off work and the lost momentum of your business,"" said Tom Mosley, an advisor in Anaheim, Calif. ""So you need to make sure you get the most out of it.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMosley estimates that he's attended more than 125 conferences over his 23-year career. A former football coach, he creates what he calls ""a game plan"" before every trip.In the weeks beforehand, he reviews the conference's calendar of events along with the roster of attendees and vendors. Then he drafts a written list of individuals he wants to see and specific questions to ask them.""It takes reflection to decide what you want to accomplish when you're there,"" he said. ""Your day can get so cluttered, so it helps to have an agenda going in.""If he knows a digital marketing firm will have a booth, he will visit with a prepared set of questions. Or if a representative from a particular life insurer will attend, he might seek information on a new product from that carrier.When weighing whether to go to a conference, many advisors assess their likely return on investment. That's especially true if they run their own firm and pay for team members — from junior associates to marketing specialists — to attend as well.For Mosley, the decision involves two steps. He starts by reviewing his annual goals for his firm. If a conference promises to help him advance any of those goals, he's more apt to show up.In 2018, for example, he has three goals revolving around marketing and lead generation, staffing additions and refining internal processes. As he scans conference descriptions, he says he evaluates to what extent he ""can move the ball downfield"" on his three current objectives.When traveling to the East Coast, he arrives a day ahead. This enables him to spring into action the next morning with a full night of sleep, as sessions or breakfast meetings often start early.To retain what he learns throughout the conference, Mosley brings a stack of index cards. When he hears a great idea, he writes it on a card.""I may have 30 index cards with me after a conference, so on the plane home I'll read through them and add notes on how we can implement an idea,"" he said. ""Then I discuss them with my staff and we commit to follow through on what I've learned.""If you want to extract the most knowledge from a conference, stay alert. Drink lots of water and listen with curiosity to presenters. Ask questions and huddle afterward with experts to clarify how you can apply learning points.For many advisors, the highlight of a conference is mingling with peers from around the country. They share best practices, discuss industry trends and compare notes on tech tools.After a long day of meetings and presentations, Mosley gathers with other advisors to socialize. He finds such interaction invaluable.""It's great to listen and learn and work through some of the challenges you face,"" he said.Informal chats with advisors — as well as guest speakers and other attendees — can produce both professional insights and personal friendships.""It can be tempting to go from one speaker to the next and ignore everybody around you,"" said Alvin Carlos, a certified financial planner in Washington, D.C. ""But I like to use the breaks between sessions to talk with the people sitting next to me. And at meals, I'll sit with others and try to have meaningful conversations.""Carlos usually attends one or two conferences a year. While he earns continuing education (CE) credit in some sessions, he chooses topics based on overall relevance to his business.""Don't just focus on CE credit,"" he said. ""I've found sessions very valuable where I don't get CE credit, like focusing on ways to delegate to staff and provide more value to clients.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Building A Successful Financial Advisory Practice?

407,A,"Stocks rose in a holiday-shortened week, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 finding support at key levels. President Donald Trump triggered a China trade war while China took aim at Micron (MU). Tesla (TSLA) finally achieved a Model 3 production goal, but the stock tumbled. So did Macau-centric casino giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS). Biogen (BIIB) soared on a promising Alzheimer's treatment. Crude oil futures topped $75 but then pulled back.The Dow Jones undercut its 200-day moving average on Tuesday, the S&P 500 index sank below its 50-day line while the Nasdaq composite tested its 50-day as China trade war fears grew. But, even with President Trump going ahead with China tariffs Friday and Beijing retaliating, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher for the week. Tesla and casino giants were big losers. Micron tumbled as a Chinese court barred some sales in the country.The electric-car maker managed to top a long-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the final week of June. But Tesla skipped a brake test to make the deadline. Overall Q2 vehicle deliveries missed estimates. Tesla bears cited those points in doubting the electric-vehicle maker can maintain and expand its end-of-June pace. Tesla stock popped Monday morning on the Model 3 news but reversed to close lower, then continued to tumble, losing 10% for the week.General Motors (GM) grew new vehicle sales 5% in the second quarter, while Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM), Honda Motor (HMC) and Nissan (NSANY) all topped estimates for U.S. auto sales in June. A strong June capped stronger-than-expected industrywide sales in the first half of 2018, as SUVs and trucks continue to boom. A solid labor market has kept buyers in the car market, despite rising gas prices and interest rates. The annualized pace of new vehicle sales reached 17.5 million in June after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Autodata.Auto stocks are struggling as Trump threatens global auto tariffs, raising supply costs, and they're likely to spur retaliation. There were reports of U.S.-Germany talks to eliminate tariffs. But China slapped new duties on U.S.-made cars Friday following Trump's decision to impose tariffs on high-tech China goods.Biogen (BIIB) and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase II tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease. The drug now known as BAN2401 slowed progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with mild dementia over a period of 18 months. Drugmakers have struggled to find treatments for the crippling disease, with many failures along the way. But the potential benefit to a drugmaker and patients is huge. Biogen stock skyrocketed Friday.Micron Technology (MU) says a Chinese court ruled against the memory-chip maker in a patent-infringement case without giving it a chance to present its defense. The injunction covers certain DRAM modules and solid-state drives, representing slightly more than 1% of Micron's annualized revenue. Micron stock tumbled 5.5% on Tuesday, while investors saw the court ruling as part of China's retaliation to Trump tariff threats. Shares rose modestly Thursday.Dell will go public as part of a $21.7 billion deal to acquire its Dell Technologies (DVMT) tracking stock. The move also reduces the likelihood near-term of a merger with virtualization-software maker VMware. VMware declared an $11 billion special cash dividend, with Dell getting roughly $9 billion to help close the DVMT transaction. VMware and Dell also announced a new governance agreement. Dell owns 81% of VMware. VMware stock rose sharply.Crude oil futures eclipsed $75 a barrel Tuesday morning for the first time since 2014. But crude retreated, undercutting $73 before closing the week off 0.5% at $73.80. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.245 million barrels while gasoline supplies fell by 1.51 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts polled by Platts S&P Global expected the EIA to report a 4.5 million decline in crude stockpiles and a 2.5 million barrel drop in gasoline stockpiles. Domestic crude production held at 10.9 million barrels per day for a third straight week. President Trump continued his attacks on OPEC, tweeting that the cartel should help lower gasoline prices as the U.S. supplies military defense for many member countries.The U.S. added 213,000 jobs in June, more than expected. April and May hiring also were revised higher. Annual wage growth of 2.7% was a bit less than expected, easing Fed rate hike fears.

Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index showed unexpected increases, signaling faster growth. Meanwhile, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rebounded in July as Americans were much more upbeat about federal economic policies.Central bank policymakers fretted about Trump tariffs and the flattening yield curve at the June 12-13 meeting but still remained hawkish, Fed meeting minutes out Thursday revealed. Fed contacts indicated that tit-for-tat tariffs and escalating trade threats were starting to impact business confidence and investment plans. Several policymakers raised concern about the narrowing of the gap between short-term and long-term Treasury yields, given that an inversion — longer rates falling below shorter ones — historically precedes a recession. Still, the Fed hiked its key rate a quarter-point for the second time in 2018 at the June meeting. Members also issued projections indicating a likelihood of two more rate hikes this year.The Washington Post reported that a federal investigation into Facebook's sharing of data with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica has broadened to focus on the tech giant's actions and statements.

But Deutsche Bank downgraded the carrier and rivals United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL), citing global trade tensions.Boeing (BA) announced that it would take over the commercial unit of Brazil's Embraer (ERJ). The Dow Jones aerospace giant will have an 80% stake in Embraer's commercial operations, valued at a total of $4.75 billion. Boeing is interested in Embraer's engineering expertise as it considers building a new middle-of-the-market jet that can better compete against the Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jet.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.

411,A,"'Inclusive' Boom: It may be a surprise, but President Trump is nowhere near as unpopular among minority voters as the biased mainstream media suggest. Why is that? In a word, jobs.Trump, it turns out, has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. In June, for instance, the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6%, its lowest level ever, from 4.9% in May. The previous all-time low was 4.8%.African-American unemployment bounced up from its all-time low of 5.9% in May to 6.5% in June. But that 6.5% still represents the second-lowest unemployment reading ever for Black Americans.As for Asian-Americans, unemployment similarly bounced off its all-time low of 2.1% in May, rising to 3.2%. And that's still 0.6 percentage point lower than when Trump entered office.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseConsider all the good news about minority employment when you hear reports of June's ""disappointing"" jobs data.The truth is, the ripping jobs growth that began when Trump entered office and picked up steam after his tax cuts has been good for everyone in America — even liberal media pundits.And it's also been good for Trump. Because quietly, he is winning over those who have benefited most from his policies: Minorities. On average, minority unemployment has dropped 18% since Trump entered office in January of 2017. More than 2 million people have dropped off food stamps and returned to work.Despite a relentless media barrage aimed at Trump and his immigration policies, a new Harvard/Harris Poll found a 10% rise in approval for Trump among Hispanics.And our own IBD/TIPP Poll data show that, on average, minority Americans' confidence in their own finances has risen from 57.1 to 63.5 since Trump took office. That's important, since people's happiness with their own finances is a good indicator of future voting tendencies. As the Zogby Poll recently noted: ""Even though President Trump receives little support from these (minority) groups, things might be going just good enough economically that ... Republicans can retain control of Congress and Trump gets re-elected in 2020.""By the way, we first discussed this phenomenon way back in December of 2017 and again in January of this year. At the time, we noted that a quick Google of the terms ""trump racism"" returned more than 25 million hits in under a second.We wondered, if Trump were truly racist, ""why would (he) put in place policies that, factually speaking, benefit minorities? It's funny, too, that those that sell this toxic brew of false racism don't mention the truth: That, like the rest of us, minorities thrive as the economy's growth picks up.""We have no reason to change our minds.

Broadcom agreed to pay $44.50 a share in cash for CA in a deal worth $18.9 billion.The deal is out of character for Broadcom, which historically has bought other chipmakers. CA makes software for managing information technology systems. Broadcom said the acquisition will create a leading infrastructure technology company.After Broadcom's pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) failed earlier this year, the company said it would focus on delivering shareholder value through organic growth, capital return and tuck-in acquisitions, Shah said.Broadcom's move to buy CA Technologies comes ""out of left field,"" he said. ""CA is a legacy software company that specializes in mainframes — shared synergies are not obvious.""The deal also raises questions about long-term growth prospects for Broadcom's core wireless and wired communications chip businesses, Shah said.B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis lowered his rating on Broadcom to neutral from buy and slashed his price target to 245 from 308.He compared the deal to chipmaker Intel's (INTC) purchase of security software firm McAfee. Intel had trouble rationalizing that purchase and ultimately sold McAfee to a private equity firm.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse lowered his rating on Broadcom stock to in-line from buy.The CA purchase lacks strategic rationale and seems more like ""financial engineering"" and a private equity play, he said.""Further, investors will likely be concerned on a 'loss of focus' in terms of broadening exposure outside of semiconductors,"" he said in a report.""We note that CA Technologies had been in the process of selling itself and had failed to attract a private equity buyer,"" Muse said. ""With software mainframe revenues in decline and no clear synergies to Broadcom's current revenue streams, we struggle to understand Broadcom's incentive here.""UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said he is willing to give Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan the benefit of the doubt.

""In fact, the most recent releases confirm our key take-away that homebuilders are seeing higher pricing gains, but lower order unit growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe singled out KB Home (KBH), Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) and Toll Bros. (TOL) as stocks that could struggle amid market challenges. The sector's recent struggles also saw LGI Home (LGIH) drop out of the prestigious IBD 50 stock list.However, D.R. Horton (DHI), due to its more diversified offerings and geographical markets, could flourish.Homebuilder stocks were the top market group in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But they've been stock-market laggards in 2018 as mortgage rates have climbed along with Treasury yields, which are getting a boost from expectations for faster inflation.The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 184th place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.According to Leon, order growth will have to rebound from mid-single digits to high-single-digit-to-low teen range in both units and order value to suggest the market is as robust as 2017. However, he is skeptical due to the late stage of the economic cycle.Government data suggest new-home sales are slowing down. In addition, confidence among homebuilders is falling, despite higher pricing gains helping to at least partially offset lower order unit growth.Mortgage rates are another headwind. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit 4.6%, an eight-year high.There is still a chance the booming jobs market could help buck the trend. Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has added 2.7 million jobs, and since his tax cuts took effect there has been an average 200,000 new jobs each month. There has yet to be an accompanying jump in wages though.""Risks to our more cautious views on the housing market and new home starts would be strong job and wage income growth with mortgage rates flat to down, near 4.5%, in the next twelve months,"" Leon said. ""A slower rate of price increases would also be relief to affordability, especially in more expensive coastal markets like Seattle and (California).""And while homebuilders are skeptical, last month consumer confidence in housing was at an all-time high, according to Fannie Mae.The government-sponsored mortgage provider's Home Purchase Sentiment Index showed the confidence of those who think home prices will move even higher rose the most, while those who think it is a good time to sell came in second.The only group that reported a drop in confidence was those who think it's a good time to buy.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Analysts Bullish On Homebuilder Stocks Despite Dip — Here's WhyLGI Homes Crushed Earnings Views With Stock Already In Buy ZoneStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

438,A,"Karl Marx was no more mistaken than usual when he said that historic people and events appear twice, first as tragedy, then as farce. Today's advocates of a musty fragment of the 1970s, the Equal Rights Amendment, are demonstrating that something that begins as farce can reappear as tragedy, because abuse of the Constitution is tragic.With Illinois slouching toward bankruptcy, its Legislature must have better things to do, yet it recently ratified the ERA. But can a legislative cadaver be ratified?On March 22, 1972, a stampeding Congress sent to the states for ratification this constitutional amendment: ""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged ... on account of sex."" Without seriously considering what this would add to the 14th Amendment's guarantee to ""any person"" of ""equal protection of the laws,"" the House and Senate passed it 354-24 and 84-8, respectively. The irony of a gallant Congress behaving cavalierly in several senses was surely lost on ERA supporters.Legislators sworn to ""support and defend"" the Constitution voted to clutter it with language the meaning of which they did not — could not — know. The meaning was irrelevant to the main purpose, which was to grandstand with an amendment the first, and for many advocates the sufficient, function of which was ""consciousness-raising"" — to ""put women in the Constitution."" Another purpose was to arm liberal judges with language into which they could pour whatever content they wanted. So, the ERA would either be a constitutional nullity or license for unconstrained judicial improvising.Because the Constitution's framers believed that the most important decisions should not be taken on slender majorities, and that frequent amendments would impair the Constitution's majesty, they required amendments to pass both houses of Congress with two-thirds majorities and receive ratification by three-quarters of the states. Since then, constitutional morality has evolved the principle that ratification should occur during a predetermined period of deliberation, reflecting (in the Supreme Court's words) a ""sufficiently contemporaneous"" consensus of at least (nowadays) 38 states ""at relatively the same period.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo, Congress, as has been customary since the 18th Amendment (Prohibition, 1919), required ERA ratification within seven years, which was generous: The first 10 amendments (aka the Bill of Rights) were ratified in 27 months. Leaving aside the 27th Amendment pertaining to congressional salary increases (dormant for 203 years, resuscitated in the anti-Congress fever of 1992), the average time for ratifying amendments since the first 10 has been 16 months, and no amendment has taken even four years. The 26th Amendment (lowering the voting age to 18) took less than four months.Hawaii ratified the ERA the day Congress passed it. Nebraska, rushing to be second, did it wrong and had to do it again. Twenty states ratified it in three months, most without hearings. In January 1977, four years and 10 months into the process, Indiana became the 35th and last state to ratify it.Twenty-six of the 35 explicitly referred to the seven-year deadline in their resolutions of ratification. When the seven years expired, those supposedly seeking equal treatment for women sought and received special treatment. By a simple majority, not the two-thirds required for constitutional amendments, a supine Congress extended the deadline for 39 months — but only for states that had not ratified it, in order to prevent new rescissions.It died in 1982, in its 123rd month, having gone longer (65 months) without a single additional state's ratification than it took to get all of its original 35. By which time five of the 35 (including, deliciously, Nebraska) had rescinded their ratifications.The only federal court to rule on the four-year extension held it unconstitutional, and said all rescissions were valid. Now, however, ERA advocates argue that the clock can never expire on ratification — states can vote over and over (as Illinois has done) until they ratify it, and no ratification can be rescinded. In 2017, Nevada ratified the cadaver, so ERA proponents insist they are just one state away from victory. But, inconveniently, ERA supporters in Congress have repeatedly reintroduced it (most recently in January 2017), thereby conceding that the process must begin again.Which is farcical. In 1972, there were 13 women in the House and two in the Senate. Today there are 90 in the House and 23 in the Senate, reflecting 46 years of legal and social changes that a prompt ratification of the ERA would not have hastened and that consignment of the ERA to the attic of 1970s nostalgia — hip-hugging bell-bottoms, etc. — will not impede.Other columns by George WillMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

444,A,"You have to love President Donald Trump. As a businessman he was ruthless in squeezing every last dollar from every opportunity. To lower costs he produced his goods in at least 12 foreign countries, including China, Indonesia, and Mexico. Anything to make a buck.So it must be karma. The president launched a trade war, which basically means shooting one's own consumers and producers.Among those hurt is the iconic U.S. motorcycle producer Harley-Davidson. The Trump tariffs are hurting the firm's bottom line. The latest estimate is that aluminum and steel levies will raise Harley-Davidson's costs by about $20 million this year, while European Union retaliation will cost the company another $45 million. The cost for next year will run $90 to $100 million.But that isn't all. The president barred American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which lowered tariffs of other nations more than the U.S.This kept foreign tariffs higher, including on U.S.-made motorcycles. So Harley decided to do what businessman Trump would have done: move productive facilities to Thailand to make more money.Now Harley plans to move more manufacturing overseas in order to sell motorcycles in Europe. Said Harley-Davidson, shifting production to Europe ""is not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe.""The president is livid. This most American of bikes, he said, should ""never be built in another country — never!"" He accused Harley of being ""the first to wave a White Flag"" in his trade war. The president complained that the company was just using the higher costs as an excuse for doing what it wanted to do anyway.He apparently feels personally betrayed. In February 2017 he hosted company executives and labor leaders at the White House. At the time he declared: ""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America."" He said he expected them to expand and he planned ""to help you, too, and we're going to make it really great for business.""So he suggested possible retaliation: ""Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into the U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Indeed, he added that if they leave ""The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before."" A White House aide said his message was that ""If you make decisions to go elsewhere, it's going to be a problem for their business.""The Washington Post complained about the president's ""authoritarian reaction."" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., declared: ""The problem isn't that Harley is unpatriotic — it's that taxes are stupid.""Blogger Rob Port complained: ""Expecting companies to deal with a higher cost of doing business out of some sense of patriotism is absurd.""That's all true. Indeed, Harley isn't likely to be alone in moving. Punishing American firms is a dubious way to promote ""Made in America.""But Harley-Davidson is a special case. The business doesn't like tariffs today because it is paying them. It had a different opinion thirty-five years ago when the Reagan Administration imposed tariffs on foreign motorcycles, which were paid by American consumers.In April 1983 Harley neared bankruptcy. Company executives had staged a buyout, so the firm lacked deep pockets and carried significant debt. With high labor costs and poor management, Harley was vulnerable to efficient Japanese manufacturers. So the Reagan administration raised the bike tariff from 4.4% to 49.4%.Unsurprisingly, the company was happy to have the government hobble its prime competitors. Ironically, it's not clear that the tariffs, which were lifted four years later, contributed much to the firm's turnaround. More important were internal improvements. By one estimate the increased tariff was responsible for just 6% of higher sales.But in 2008 and 2009 Harley also took out 33 emergency loans through the Federal Reserve's Commercial Paper Funding Facility, worth $2.3 billion. The company was wobbly and relied on cheap federal credit.Thus, the issue isn't just Harley responding to a worsening economic environment created by the president. The company ran to Uncle Sam for aid, but now doesn't want to help others. Aid for me but not for thee appears to be Harley's perspective. So I'm OK with the president shaking down Harley-Davidson.President Trump's trade war will do far more harm than good. However, it has exposed the hypocrisy of American business. If firms want the benefit of trade restrictions, they should be prepared to bear the costs as well.

447,A,"Walt Disney (DIS) won U.S. antitrust approval for its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets, raising hurdles to a potential rival bid from Comcast (CMCSA).XDisney agreed to sell Fox's regional sports networks to resolve the Justice Department's concerns that the deal would raise prices for pay-TV companies, according to court filings made Wednesday in New York.Disney rose to a session high after Bloomberg reported that the government clearance was imminent. It climbed 1% to $105.41 at 12:11 p.m. in New York. Fox gained as much as 2.5%.The approval is a victory for Disney in its battle with Comcast for one of the media industry's biggest prizes. Fox last week accepted a sweetened bid from Disney, which upped its offer following Comcast's competing $65 billion bid. The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December -- and $3 above Comcast's bid.Comcast is now mulling its next steps, including possibly teaming up with private equity investors in its pursuit of Fox assets, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal reported that if the bidding reaches a high enough level -- say, $90 billion -- the company may go to private equity firms or other backers for help. In one scenario cited by the newspaper, a strategic investor could take on Fox's U.S. assets -- including the 20th Century Fox studio and regional sports networks -- and leave Comcast with overseas assets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Disney-Comcast contest will determine who controls much of Rupert Murdoch's empire, including Fox's movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc. At stake is a trove of media properties ranging from ""The Simpsons"" to ""X-Men.""Disney and Comcast are looking to use the Fox assets to bolster their content, expand overseas and fend off the threat from Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming upstarts. That threat prompted AT&T (T) to buy Time Warner, a deal the government challenged and lost at trial.Disney and Comcast have traded jabs over which bid would face an easier path to regulatory approval, an important consideration for Fox stockholders, who must weigh which deal to accept. A July 10 Fox shareholder vote on the Disney deal was postponed to a ""future date"" to allow more time to evaluate Disney's new offer.When Comcast made its bid for Fox, Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said in a letter to Murdoch and his sons that he is ""highly confident"" that Comcast will ""obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and that our transaction is as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

452,A,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and Proofpoint (PFPT) are often mentioned in a discussion of top cybersecurity stocks. But a lesser-known name in the group — Qualys (QLYS) — is worthy of a closer look.With a market capitalization of around $3.5 billion, Qualys is a provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. The company's technology helps customers collect and analyze IT security data. It also helps identify and prioritize vulnerabilities.Fund sponsorship, critical to a growth stock's long-term success, has been steadily rising in recent quarters. Another positive is that Qualys is nowhere near ""overowned."" At the end of the second quarter, fewer than 400 funds owned shares. When a growth stock gets overowned by funds and other institutional investors, it gets harder to move the price.In its latest reported quarter, the cybersecurity leader reported adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share, up 80% from the year-ago quarter. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 22% to $64.9 million.For the current quarter, the Zacks consensus estimate expects profit of 35 cents a share, up 35%. Sales are forecast to rise 21% to $67.13 million.Last year, annual pretax margin and return on equity were at or near multiyear highs of 29% and 14.4%, respectively.After a breakout above an 85.10 buy point, shares jumped more than 6% on June 14. The move was fueled by a raised price target from Needham to 105 from 95.A technical flaw for Qualys is that it recently flashed a sell signal when it erased a double-digit gain from the buy point. That means the latest buy point is null and void. But after an orderly pullback and with the stock comfortably above the buy point again, aggressive investors might be willing to give the stock a second chance.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.You Might Also Like:Cloud Computing: Find Top Cloud Stocks And Track Industry TrendsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch; See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe table below shows how indexes based on IBD's stock lists have significantly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500. In 2017, the Sector Leaders screen more than doubled the performance of the S&P, while the IBD 50 outpaced it by 79%. In Q2 2018, IBD stock lists continued to top the S&P 500. (Data as of June 29, 2018).See How To Use IBD Stock Lists And RatingsThe strategy behind IBD's stocks lists is simple.Through an ongoing study of every top-performing stock over the past 100-plus years, we've identified seven common traits big market winners typically share just before they launch their major moves.Using IBD SmartSelect Ratings and other screening criteria based on that research, we identify which stocks are most strongly showing those same traits right now.In other words, history shows what big market winners look like in the early stages of a new climb, and IBD's lists alert you to stocks that have that same look today.Also note that the screens are computer-generated and based solely on objective rules, not human emotions, guesswork or predictions.While you should never just buy a stock because it's on one of IBD's screens, regularly checking Sector Leaders and other lists is a quick and efficient way to build your own watchlist and zero in on the next crop of potential big winners.To further speed up your research, you'll also find alerts to stocks in or near a potential buy zone in the chart analysis provided for each name on Sector Leaders, IBD 50, IBD Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and Stock Spotlight.For example, self-driving car technology leader Nvidia was featured in the IBD Big Cap 20 on March 1, 2016 and in the IBD 50 the next week on March 7. The chart analysis noted that the stock was ""working on cup base with 34.04 entry, strong weekly RS line."" That gave you time to put Nvidia on your watch list and research the company before it broke out two weeks later.From the breakout, Nvidia rocketed over 660% in just 24 months before pulling back. Throughout its run, Nvidia has continued to show up on various IBD lists and is still on the IBD 50. Nvidia is just one recent example of why you want to regularly check IBD's stock lists as part of your investing routine.Not every stock on the lists will launch those types of gains, but checking these screens regularly is a proven way to help improve your investing results by quickly building a high-quality, actionable watch list.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Companies Are On IBD Stock Lists Right Now?Facebook, Nvidia, Netflix Reveal 3 Key Stock-Picking TipsLessons On How To Invest: When To Buy And Sell, Chart Reading And MoreVideo: How To Find Top-Rated Stocks Before They Break Out

460,A,"You have to love President Donald Trump. As a businessman he was ruthless in squeezing every last dollar from every opportunity. To lower costs he produced his goods in at least 12 foreign countries, including China, Indonesia, and Mexico. Anything to make a buck.So it must be karma. The president launched a trade war, which basically means shooting one's own consumers and producers.Among those hurt is the iconic U.S. motorcycle producer Harley-Davidson. The Trump tariffs are hurting the firm's bottom line. The latest estimate is that aluminum and steel levies will raise Harley-Davidson's costs by about $20 million this year, while European Union retaliation will cost the company another $45 million. The cost for next year will run $90 to $100 million.But that isn't all. The president barred American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which lowered tariffs of other nations more than the U.S.This kept foreign tariffs higher, including on U.S.-made motorcycles. So Harley decided to do what businessman Trump would have done: move productive facilities to Thailand to make more money.Now Harley plans to move more manufacturing overseas in order to sell motorcycles in Europe. Said Harley-Davidson, shifting production to Europe ""is not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe.""The president is livid. This most American of bikes, he said, should ""never be built in another country — never!"" He accused Harley of being ""the first to wave a White Flag"" in his trade war. The president complained that the company was just using the higher costs as an excuse for doing what it wanted to do anyway.He apparently feels personally betrayed. In February 2017 he hosted company executives and labor leaders at the White House. At the time he declared: ""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America."" He said he expected them to expand and he planned ""to help you, too, and we're going to make it really great for business.""So he suggested possible retaliation: ""Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into the U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Indeed, he added that if they leave ""The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before."" A White House aide said his message was that ""If you make decisions to go elsewhere, it's going to be a problem for their business.""The Washington Post complained about the president's ""authoritarian reaction."" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., declared: ""The problem isn't that Harley is unpatriotic — it's that taxes are stupid.""Blogger Rob Port complained: ""Expecting companies to deal with a higher cost of doing business out of some sense of patriotism is absurd.""That's all true. Indeed, Harley isn't likely to be alone in moving. Punishing American firms is a dubious way to promote ""Made in America.""But Harley-Davidson is a special case. The business doesn't like tariffs today because it is paying them. It had a different opinion thirty-five years ago when the Reagan Administration imposed tariffs on foreign motorcycles, which were paid by American consumers.In April 1983 Harley neared bankruptcy. Company executives had staged a buyout, so the firm lacked deep pockets and carried significant debt. With high labor costs and poor management, Harley was vulnerable to efficient Japanese manufacturers. So the Reagan administration raised the bike tariff from 4.4% to 49.4%.Unsurprisingly, the company was happy to have the government hobble its prime competitors. Ironically, it's not clear that the tariffs, which were lifted four years later, contributed much to the firm's turnaround. More important were internal improvements. By one estimate the increased tariff was responsible for just 6% of higher sales.But in 2008 and 2009 Harley also took out 33 emergency loans through the Federal Reserve's Commercial Paper Funding Facility, worth $2.3 billion. The company was wobbly and relied on cheap federal credit.Thus, the issue isn't just Harley responding to a worsening economic environment created by the president. The company ran to Uncle Sam for aid, but now doesn't want to help others. Aid for me but not for thee appears to be Harley's perspective. So I'm OK with the president shaking down Harley-Davidson.President Trump's trade war will do far more harm than good. However, it has exposed the hypocrisy of American business. If firms want the benefit of trade restrictions, they should be prepared to bear the costs as well.

469,A,"SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket received a massive boost with a $130 million military contract, just 4-1/2 months after its maiden flight.XThe private company, whose founder is Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has been tasked with delivering the classified Air Force Space Command-52 satellite, according to an Air Force announcement late Thursday. The project is scheduled for completion by September 2020.Earlier in the week, the Air Force also certified the Falcon Heavy for national-security missions, despite the fact that the new rocket has only carried out one test launch in early February.SpaceX beat the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), in what is believed to be their first head-to-head contest for a heavy-lift mission. SpaceX's $130 million mission cost is much less than the $350 million minimum of a ULA Delta IV Heavy launch.The Air Force contract marks an additional vote of confidence after the Zuma spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in January.SpaceX said at the time that it ""did everything correctly,"" and reports later suggested the problem may have been with Northrop's custom-built adapter that was used to link its satellite with the Falcon 9.Boeing shares were up 0.4% on the stock market today, while Lockheed's shares were down 0.4%.The massive Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. Thrust from its 27 engines is equivalent to 18 Boeing 747s, making it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.Before awarding the latest contract to SpaceX for the classified satellite, the Air Force had already planned to use the Falcon Heavy in its Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites. That mission is scheduled for sometime this year.The Falcon Heavy has also secured commercial missions and so far has contracts to stage satellite launch missions for ViaSat, Inmarsat and Arabsat.Famously, the payload for its first launch back in February was Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster. The car was then sent on a trans-Mars injection heliocentric orbit.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:SpaceX Gets Backing For This Controversial Plan, Boosting 'Space Taxi'5 Insane SpaceX Predictions CEO Elon Musk Made Ahead Of Falcon 9 LaunchSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?How To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

471,A,"Canadian medical marijuana producer Tilray on Monday said it had launched an initial public offering after its application to list on the Nasdaq. That would make it the latest pure-play pot company to join marijuana stocks Cronos Group (CRON) and Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) on a major U.S. exchange.Tilray said it would offer 9 million shares with an expected price range at $14 to $16 a share. The company supplies marijuana in Canada and parts of Latin America, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, according to regulatory disclosures.Tilray filed for the IPO last month. The company, founded in 2013, says it plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""TLRY.""Tilray is a subsidiary of Privateer Holdings, a cannabis-focused investment firm founded in 2010 in Seattle. Privateer Holdings acquired the cannabis review and information website Leafly in 2011.As the legal market in nations like Canada transforms backwoods growing operations into full-blown weed corporations, North America's marijuana industry has carved out ways to expand its shareholder audience in both Canada and America — while avoiding U.S. legal barriers. Companies in Canada have tried to raise money and consolidate ahead of recreational legalization, which takes hold in October.Cronos Group, another pot producer in Canada, in February became the first marijuana stock to list on the Nasdaq. Canopy Growth, also a Canadian marijuana company, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in May. MedMen, a marijuana cultivator and retailer in the U.S., went public in Canada in May. High Times is planning an IPO for later this year.Among marijuana stocks and related plays, Cronos Group closed down 0.1%, while Canopy lost 1.5%. the stock market today. Corona parent Constellation Brands (STZ), which has invested in Canopy Growth and is weighing legal ways to gain exposure to the U.S. marijuana business, picked up 1.6%. Tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), which said it was investing in a marijuana company, added 0.6%.The company has also filed a preliminary prospectus for a proposed IPO in Canada in every province except Quebec, it said in a statement. The company did so, it said, ""to qualify the offering of securities in Canada and to ensure that purchasers in Canada are not subject to restrictions on resale."" The company said it doesn't intend to list on any Canadian exchange.BMO Capital Markets and Cowen are acting as book-runners for Tilray's proposed IPO, Tilray said. Cowen is managing those duties in the U.S., and BMO is handling them in Canada.Roth Capital Partners is acting lead manager of the IPO in the U.S., Tilray said. Northland Capital Markets is co-manager. Eight Capital is acting as lead manager for the IPO in Canada. Tilray said the offering would be made via a prospectus.Tilray said it stood out from rivals due to its global distribution network and deep research capacity. Canopy Growth has also set its sights on the global marijuana market, saying Germany would be the market to watch in Europe over the next year. Medical marijuana became legal in Germany in 2017.Tilray reported a net loss of $7.8 million last year, with revenue of $20.5 million, a 62% jump, according to a registration statement filed with the SEC. The company also warned about roadblocks ahead in the recreational market.""Legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada may have a significant negative effect on our medical cannabis business and there is no guarantee that we will be able to participate or effectively compete in the adult-use cannabis market in Canada,"" Tilray said in the SEC filing.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?How Bitcoin's Boom Created This Obstacle For Marijuana Companies Going PublicMarijuana Stocks To Buy And Watch

478,A,"Nissan Motor (NSANY), the Japanese carmaker that was embroiled in a vehicle-inspection scandal last year, said it uncovered some instances of misconduct involving falsified data about exhaust emissions and fuel economy.XThe data falsification, which occurred on 19 models across five plants in Japan, was found out when the company was carrying out an internal check about employees conducting final inspection of vehicles, Nissan said at its Yokohama headquarters Monday. The incident won't lead to any recalls as the vehicles meet catalog specifications for fuel economy and emissions, according to the company.Although the tests were not in line with Japanese government requirements, the incident -- based on what has been disclosed -- may not be as threatening as the emission scandal that engulfed Volkswagen (VLKAY). Testing of vehicle emissions rose to prominence globally after the European carmaker was caught fitting devices on its diesel vehicles that helped it overcome the standards. German authorities are still scrutinizing the automaker. Daimler is also under investigation, and both face lawsuits in Germany and the U.S.During the checks, Nissan found out that employees misrepresented temperature and humidity data in the testing chamber and manipulated emission data on carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The automaker has hired a law firm to investigate the matter further.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNissan's announcement, following an inspection debacle that led to the recall of about 1.2 million vehicles last year, is the latest in a string of compliance scandals at carmakers including Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Subaru Corp. that has dented the reputation of Japan's manufacturing sector.Nissan dropped 4.6% in Tokyo, the largest decline since November 2016, before the company held a press conference Monday. The stock has lost 11% of its value this year.Renault, which is the largest shareholder of Nissan, tumbled as much as 2.6% initially, before recouping some of those losses.Hiroto Saikawa, 64, said last year he and other officials at the carmaker will take a voluntary pay cut after the car inspection crisis led to a vehicle recall in Japan and a reduction in its profit forecast. Nissan halted vehicle registrations in Japan after its inspection process was deemed faulty by the government.Workers not authorized to certify vehicles approved the final inspection at the very end of assembly lines and that process may have dated back to 1979 at its Tochigi plant, according to a report last year from Nissan and a third-party law firm it assigned to investigate.Last year, Kobe Steel Ltd. said it sold products that failed quality control tests to over 500 companies. Subaru, which admitted to manipulating emission data records to match mileage submitted to the government, was also embroiled in a similar controversy as Nissan's. Yasuyuki Yoshinaga stepped down as Subaru CEO this year.Nissan bailed out Mitsubishi Motors in 2016 after the company was caught falsifying mileage estimates for several of its vehicles. Suzuki Motor Corp. Chairman Osamu Suzuki ceded the role of CEO after the automaker admitted to using unapproved fuel-economy testing methods in 2016.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

496,A,"Last month, Republican businessman John Cox comfortably coasted to a second-place finish in California's gubernatorial primary. But his emergence as the runner-up to Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom was no sure thing.California's unique open primary rules allow the two candidates with the most votes to advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. Republicans make up just 25% of the electorate, so it was quite plausible that deep-blue California might choose two Democrats to battle it out in November.But the Republican Cox finished just seven points behind the Democrat Newsom. That says a lot about one issue in particular — single-payer health care. Newsom has made the policy a centerpiece of his campaign. Cox, on the other hand, is a vocal critic of socialized medicine.The closer-than-expected race offers evidence that Californians aren't unanimously behind the Democratic Party's plan for a government takeover of the state's health care system. And they shouldn't be. Single-payer is a disastrously expensive policy that has led to treatment delays, shortages, higher taxes, and rationing every place it's been tried.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNewsom has endorsed SB 562, a single-payer bill that passed the State Senate in June of last year. The bill would replace all private health coverage in the Golden State with a single, government-run plan covering all California residents, including those residing in the state illegally. The proposal stalled in the State Assembly when Speaker Anthony Rendon — a Democrat — declared it ""woefully incomplete.""The bill did not provide any details on how it would raise the $400 billion needed to fund single-payer. That figure is double the state's current budget.Half of the $400 billion was to be diverted from federal funding for existing programs like Medicare and Medi-Cal. But that would require federal consent — an unlikely scenario with President Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress. Californians would have to cover the remaining $200 billion through new taxes.State senators suggested one possible source of funding — a new 15% tax. So much for ""free"" health care.The cost of statewide single-payer systems is insurmountable. Even Vermont — home to single-payer's biggest champion, Sen. Bernie Sanders — rejected a statewide single-payer plan back in 2014. The system would have required an 11.5% percent payroll tax on businesses and a 9.5% income tax. Then-Governor Peter Shumlin, who originally supported single-payer, ultimately abandoned the plan after admitting that such taxes would cripple the state's economy.Money isn't the only reason to reject single-payer. The system is also disastrous for patients. When health services are ""free,"" patients have no reason to limit their consumption. But even an entity the size of the government has limited resources to pay for care. So shortages and long wait times are inevitable.The single-payer system in my native Canada, for instance, forces patients to wait a median of more than 21 weeks to receive treatment from specialists after they obtain referrals from general practitioners. In some provinces, the wait is much longer. In 2017, the median wait time in New Brunswick was just shy of 42 weeks.The situation is just as bleak for patients in the United Kingdom's government-run health care system, the National Health Service. In the last year, more than 2,600 patients waited at least 12 months for elective treatment. Resources are so poorly managed that the agency was forced to cancel tens of thousands of surgeries — including urgent procedures — last winter.Newsom has decided to ignore these realities on the campaign trail. As he put it, ""There's no reason to wait around on universal health care and single-payer in California.""Faced with such willful obliviousness, it's no surprise that so many voters in solidly blue California cast their vote for a foe of government-run health care. As Cox said on the campaign trail, SB 562 would put in place ""a socialist-styled health care delivery system that has failed in other countries and states, as governments cannot afford to fund it properly, and health care gets rationed.""When they enter the voting booth this November, Californians will be deciding not only on a gubernatorial candidate but on whether to authorize a government takeover of their health care system that will be hazardous to their health.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

499,A,"General Electric (GE) called its restructuring complete and said planned moves will ""likely"" lower the dividend, with analysts estimating that the payout could be cut sharply again.XCEO John Flannery on Tuesday announced the results of a yearlong strategic review, saying it will spin off its core health business within 12-18 months, fully separate Baker Hughes (BHGE), and narrow its focus to aviation, power and renewable energy, among the most salient portfolio changes.Flannery had said earlier that separating the aviation and power businesses were possibilities too. But management on Tuesday described aviation, power and renewable energy as ""three highly complementary businesses"" poised for future growth.On an issue that matters greatly to income-oriented retail investors, the industrial giant said it will maintain its dividend until the health care unit is established as an independent entity.At that time, GE Healthcare's dividend policy will be decided by its new board of directors and is expected to be in line with health care peers, while GE's board will adjust the GE dividend and expects it to be in line with industrial peers.Later Tuesday morning, on the company's investor call, Flannery clarified: ""Given the typically lower payout ratios in the health care industry, this will likely lead to a reduction in the aggregate GE dividend at that time.""Flannery added that the restructuring was ""finished,"" bringing to an end the complex process he oversaw after being named chief executive just over a year ago.CFRA analysts noted the health care and Baker Hughes separations, together with previously announced divestitures, would bring GE to its goal of $20 billion in asset sales.""The asset sales and greater industrial focus will help GE achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA target of less than 2.5X and to reduce debt by $25 billion by 2020,"" CFRA added.Shares sprang up 7.8% to 13.74 Tuesday in their first day as a nonmember of the Dow Jones industrial average. Baker Hughes rose 2.1% to 33.13. On Wednesday, GE shares rose again and climbed above the 50-day moving average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa noted that separating the health care and oil-and-gas businesses is likely to send earnings and free cash flow much lower, meaning they won't be enough to support the current dividend payout of 48 cents.He warned of a significant cut.""We point out that the standing dividend payout for GE is 75% on Industrial FCF (100+% including outflows for ""other investing activities""), which compares to ~50% for Philips Healthcare and Siemens (SIEGY) Healthineers and a ~40% median for Industrial peers, implying a future payout ratio in the 40%-50% range — translation, the dividend will likely be cut materially,"" Tusa wrote.Last November, the company sliced its dividend in half. That sparked a sharp plunge in the stock, contributing to its ouster from the Dow Jones industrial average after Monday's close.Other analysts also said the restructuring plan was what they expected, while noting that it will be dilutive to earnings per share and free cash flow.""Further, the proposed separation of Healthcare would remove one of the most stable earnings streams of GE's portfolio, although this would be somewhat offset by the separation of O&G (oil-and-gas) levered BHGE,"" Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie wrote in a Tuesday note.UBS' Steven Winoker saw as a positive GE's efforts at ""getting to a forward vision."" He deemed negative an additional $3 billion capital contribution to GE Capital.""No doubt this is all dilutive when said and done,"" Winoker concluded.And Melius Research's Scott Davis called GE's strategic plan logical, although it fell short of the full breakup he had argued for.Health care, he noted, was a solid asset and ""one with the least amount of synergies with the rest of GE."" Meanwhile, the aviation and power businesses ""share engine technology synergies,"" with the former boasting growth while the latter has a path to recovery.Edward Jones' Jeff Windau called the restructuring efforts warranted but argued there is now uncertainty about direction with the spinoffs.""It is unclear what would happen to the Capital business and how liabilities, such as pensions, would be distributed,"" he wrote. ""Overall, we believe this could result in fluctuations in GE's stock price as the market waits for clarity.""On Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook for GE's credit rating to negative, matching outlooks from Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.GE's target net leverage is still high and well below where its peers are currently, Tusa said.Commentary from Moody's is ""leaning cautious, highlighting that they do not view (the health care IPO) as a silver bullet when it comes to fixing the liability side of the house,"" he added.GE expects to generate cash from disposing of its 20% interest in the health business and to distribute the remaining 80% to shareholders through a tax-free distribution.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:GE Uses Last Day On Dow Jones Industrial Average To Shrink FurtherIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?The Big Picture: Trump Bull Gets Bloody Nose; Eye This Sell Signal

502,A,"Without question, AbbVie (ABBV) has proved itself to be a pharmaceutical leader with an extremely healthy dividend to boot.The company debuted on the NYSE in January 2013 near 35. Since then, the stock has climbed as much as 259%. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has rallied as much as 105%.AbbVie, therefore, is living proof that savvy dividend investors who also seek capital appreciation can achieve both.What are the keys to the Chicago-based medical giant's long-term success?First, the company's focus on important therapeutic areas provides opportunity. AbbVie aims at products to tackle diseases in immunology, cancer, virology and neuroscience. And the company has produced medicines that gain traction.On Friday, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted approval of its Venclexta treatment in combination with rituximab to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and have received at least one prior therapy. A Phase III clinical trial found that the combined regimen cut the risk of disease progression or death by 81% vs. a standard chemoimmunotherapy.In 2017, AbbVie's total revenue grew 10% to $28.2 billion. In 2013, its top line was $18.8 billion. AbbVie, a spinoff from Abbott Labs (ABT), earned $5.60 a share last year, up 16%.Second, solid dividend generators tend to show stable and increasing earnings. AbbVie excels in both. The three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 shows tremendous stability on a scale of zero to 99, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Wall Street expects profits to rise 39% this year to $7.79 and 14% to $8.91 in 2019.On May 15, AbbVie paid 96 cents a share in cash to holders of record on April 13. That dividend translates to 3.8% vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500. A year ago, AbbVie paid 64 cents a share, both on Feb. 15 and May 15.Third, income investors gain an advantage when more funds are piling into their stocks. What about AbbVie?At the end of March 2018, mutual funds and hedge fund owning AbbVie shares totaled 2,514, up from 2,285 funds at the end of the second quarter in 2017. Total share ownership also grew over the same time frame, rising 3% to 626.1 million shares.The top-rated Fidelity Contrafund (ticker symbol FCNTX) boosted its ownership by 1.46 million shares to 3.95 million shares as of the end of Q1 this year.AbbVie shares are in basing mode and are still trading 20% beneath an all-time high of 125.86. The stock is trying to hold support at the 50-day moving average.On Aug. 31 last year, AbbVie rallied out of a five-week flat base in heavy volume. The stock surpassed a 75.14 proper entry and rallied 67% before going into its current basing action.RELATED:Top Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50The Best Large Cap Stocks Today: Inside Big Cap 20Inside Investor's Corner: How To Find The Right Buy Point For Most Stocks

503,A,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP Poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. In addition to tracking President Trump's job approval rating, the index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP Poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, and whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions gauge satisfaction with the direction of the country, respondents' quality of life, and the United States' standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index climbed nearly 8% in July to the highest level since President Trump first took office. The highest reading Trump has scored on this index was in his first month in office, when it stood at 49.2. The lowest came in August 2017, when it fell to 35.9.The Leadership Index comprises three subindexes measuring the president's favorability (up 4.2% in July), job approval (up 9.4%), and whether he is providing strong leadership (up 10.3%).The July poll found that 41% of the public approves of the job President Trump is doing, which is up 5 points from the month before. This is the highest approval rating Trump has received since March 2017, and it's just a point below Trump's first month in office. Fifty-four percent say they disapprove of the job he's doing.The Direction of the Country Index dipped 1.8% in July to 44.5. The index is currently well above its 17-year average of 41.6, and even further ahead of the 37 average during President Obama's eight years in office.The Quality of Life Index also dropped 1.8% in July, the second monthly drop for this index. It had been climbing fairly steadily under Trump. At 60, this index is still close to the all-time high level of 63.1, reached in January 2004. The average under President Obama was 53.7. Unlike other measures, the Quality of Life Index has been relatively steady over the past 17 years.The Standing in the World Index was essentially flat in July at 44.9.  That just slightly below the 17-year average for this index of 45.5, and above the average 42.6 under Obama. Over the past 17 years, the highest this index ever reached was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when it hit 74.9.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsJune 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

511,A,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose more than 700% over the next 27 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can identify the cup with handle that Amazon formed from October 2016 to February 2017.Learn More About Cup-With-Handle PatternsThe double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.Here's what to look for in a double bottom:Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.Facebook Breakout From Double BottomLike many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can spot the powerful breakout Abiomed (ABMD) launched from a flat base in early January of this year.Learn More About Flat BasesGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Improve Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

513,A,"Sales of the riskiest subprime auto bonds are on pace for a record year, according to Barclays.Companies have sold more than $150 million of B rated subprime auto ABS bonds this year, compared with nothing last year, and an annual average of about $20 million since the financial crisis, Barclays analyst Alin Florea wrote in a recent note. Meanwhile, BB rated debt in the sector has already exceeded $500 million and looks set to pass last year's total of $950 million.""Despite the volatility earlier in the year, 2018 is shaping up to be a banner year for subprime, auto ABS high yield issuance,"" Florea wrote. Subprime auto ABS issuers have started to sell more BB- and B rated bonds to meet investor demand for riskier slices of the debt.The dive deeper into the lower tiers of subprime auto ABS highlights how investors are reaching further down the chain of risk as they search for a better rate of return on their investments.The bulk of the $150 million of B rated subprime auto ABS bonds sold this year has come from Westlake Financial Services, but four others firms have also issued the lower-rated debt.For issuers, all of this implies that if they bring it, investors will buy it.

514,A,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction. Stamps.com (STMP) slid more than 11% in quadruple normal share turnover and briefly undercut its 50-day moving average.Leaderboard name Etsy (ETSY), the global online marketplace for arts and crafts entrepreneurs, hit a new high of 45.88 but reversed to a 1.6% decline. Volume is running twice its 50-day average.Big declines in heavier than normal volume are a telltale sign of pronounced institutional selling.Etsy, which holds a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, has already rallied more than 45% since vaulting off its 50-day moving average near 29.18 in late May.Shares are also up more than 108% since clearing a cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21, one week after the market staged a Day 4 follow-through and signaled a new market uptrend was possibly in play.The automaker group fared among the 10 worst performers in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.Ferrari (RACE) gapped lower at the open and skidded 2%. At 140.32, the maker of luxury sports cars is now slightly below a 141.66 buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 3% but is still finding a floor of potential support at the 350 level. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer continue to sail well past its rising 50-day moving average, which has recently risen back above 300.The stock continues to work on a large first-stage base.While the Street sees the company losing $6.82 a share this year, it also expects Tesla to turn a profit of $2.52 a share in 2019.In other financial markets, investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.90%.Ahead of the OPEC meeting on Friday in Vienna, Austria, WTI crude oil futures edged 0.1% lower to $65.62 a barrel.

515,A,"The higher swipe fees American Express (AXP) charges merchants compared to some rivals will remain intact, after the Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lawsuit alleging the credit-card company stifled competition by barring merchants from encouraging customers to use cards that carry lower merchant fees.XThe court ruled 5-4 in favor of American Express, saying that the company's so-called ""anti-steering"" provisions didn't violate U.S. antitrust law. The decision could bolster American Express' financials, as credit card issuers, payment processors, banks and tech companies race to attract wealthier customers and adapt to a more mobile, electronic payments landscape.American Express closed up 1.35% at 98.54 in the stock market today. Rivals Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) both slid, falling 3.25% and 3.2%, respectively. Both Visa and Mastercard were testing support at their 50-day lines.Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 1.5%, touching its 200-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe plaintiffs — Ohio and a handful of other states — argued that American Express' rules resulted in merchants having to pay higher swipe fees, which, in turn, were inherited by customers. AmEx said, basically, that they didn't.Here are five takeaways from the court's ruling:Businesses have to stomach swipe fees like those from AmEx when customers use credit cards to buy things. Thus, they sometimes try to discourage, or ""steer,"" customers away from using cards that carry higher merchant fees. When a shop takes American Express, they typically agree to the card issuer's antisteering provisions.AmEx has been doing stuff like this since the 1950s. But Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote for the majority, said that the plaintiffs' case failed to show AmEx's practices harmed competition.He also said their case failed to grasp the balancing act of who pays what on either side of a credit-card transaction. And he argued that when defining the credit card market, it should include both merchants and cardholders. He said the primary product of credit-card companies was transactions, rather than merchant services. Thus, ""the competitive effects of a restraint on transactions cannot be judged by looking at merchants alone.""""Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anticompetitive exercise of market power,"" he wrote.Thomas said that instead, the plaintiffs needed to prove that American Express' anti-steering provisions raised the cost of credit-card transactions ""above a competitive level"" or reduced the number of credit-card transactions.Thomas also wrote that Visa and Mastercard have ""significant structural advantages"" over American Express. Thomas said that Visa and Mastercard accounted for more than 432 million cards in circulation in the U.S., while AmEx had only 53 million and that fewer locations accepted it.He also said that Visa and Mastercard get half their sales by collecting interest. American Express, conversely, gets most of its sales from merchant fees, and focuses more on rewards catered toward wealthier cardholders.""Amex's increased merchant fees reflect increases in the value of its services and the cost of its transactions, not an ability to charge above a competitive price,"" he continued.""It uses higher merchant fees to offer its cardholders a more robust rewards program, which is necessary to maintain cardholder loyalty and encourage the level of spending that makes it valuable to merchants.""Nomura analyst Bill Carcache, in a research note on Monday, said that a ruling against AmEx would be unlikely to cause significant damage to the company.He also said that AmEx's discount rates weren't much higher than other premium Visa and Mastercard cards, indicating that businesses wouldn't gain that much from discouraging customers from using their AmEx cards.""Although we never expected a negative fundamental impact on AXP's business even if the ruling went against it ... putting this issue in the rearview removes an overhang and is incrementally positive for the stock, in our view,"" he wrote.CFRA analyst Chris Kuiper appeared to agree.""We think this bolsters AXP's competitive positioning against rivals and removes a potential negative catalyst in the near term that may have been weighing on shares.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day Is One Of Several Payment Processors In Buy ZonesSquare Moves Into Buy Zone, Leading Italy-Resistant Financials

519,A,"EVERETT, Wash. — After months of delays and billions in cost overruns for Boeing (BA), the Air Force and the aerospace giant have agreed on a delivery schedule for a new aerial refueling tanker, but there is still critical work to be done.XBoeing will deliver the first KC-46 tanker in October with 17 more to arrive by April 2019. That compares to Boeing's contractual obligation to deliver the initial 18 aircraft by August 2017. The Air Force will eventually receive 179 tankers under a deal worth more than $40 billion.The agreement comes after Boeing had said the first delivery would happen this summer while the Air Force said by the end of the year. Even though they are now on the same page, the Air Force acknowledges there is still some unfinished business.""While the KC-46A flight test program is nearly complete, significant work remains,"" said Air Force Under Secretary Matthew Donovan in a statement.The KC-46 tanker still has 4% of its certifications left, according to Boeing, but the refueling boom has been a particular headache.In fact, the last major hurdle is getting the boom, cameras the the operator all working together smoothly, Sean Martin, Boeing's chief refueling operator for the KC-46, told IBD at the massive plant where the company builds the planes.""The boom is fully capable, has exceptional handing qualities,"" he said. ""I think it's the combination of the human interface to the system and the camera to the boom we are working through right now""For example, the cameras have issues if the sun is at a certain angle, he explained.While the air frame is a modified 767 commercial jet that has rolled off Boeing's production lines countless times, the boom was designed specifically for the KC-46 and not a carryover from earlier tankers.""Only the outer mold line of the boom is the same, and we did that for air stability since we had flight tested that boom on KC-10,"" Martin said.

520,A,"When you start learning how to read stock charts, you'll have plenty of questions. What is a stock chart? What's in a chart? What's the best way to approach stock chart reading for beginners? Why even use charts?Learning how to read stock charts may seem intimidating at first. But with some basic tips and a little practice, you'll soon be using them to find winning stocks, to see how to buy stocks and to spot the right time to sell.In this first installment of our series on chart reading basics, you'll learn what's inside a stock chart. You'll also see why it's important to make chart analysis part of your regular investing routine, which can help you find breakout stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). And by using charts, you'll be able to run all your stock ideas and stock picks through a buying checklist and selling checklist.In the second installment, we cover the three key factors to look for in a chart. And in Part 3, you'll see how to spot the three most profitable chart patterns.Tip: See our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe first thing to understand about charts is that they tell you a story.Is the stock being heavily bought by mutual fund managers and other large investors? Or are these so-called institutional investors dumping shares as fast as they can?Is the stock finding a floor of support from which it can keep climbing higher? Or does it keep bumping its head against a ceiling of resistance?You can literally ""see"" that story as it unfolds once you learn how to interpret the price and volume action. By the end of this series, you'll be able to do just that.The second thing to understand about charts is that if you don't use them, you're essentially investing with a blindfold. You won't be able to see what's really happening with the stock.We all know share prices go up and down every day. But it's only by using charts that you can keep those fluctuations in perspective and understand whether it's time to buy, sell or hold.An investor who doesn't use charts is the same as an orthopedic doctor who doesn't use X-rays, or a cardiologist who doesn't hook up patients to an EKG machine.Doctors use these tools to spot patterns and anomalies, and to make a proper diagnosis. Savvy investors use charts for essentially the same reason. They help you understand the true health of a stock, and to spot timely buy and sell signals.So be sure to arm yourself with the tools of the trade. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil says, ""Fortunes are made every year by people who learn to properly read charts.""Here's a quick overview of the basic chart elements and related concepts. As you go through them, be sure to scroll down and check out the charts below for an explanation of the main elements you'll find inside IBD stock charts.Price And VolumeIBD charts are divided into two main areas: price and volume (i.e., the number of shares traded).It's critical that you look at price and volume together in order to understand the ""story"" a chart is telling. If you only look at changes in the share price, it doesn't tell you how serious the buying or selling is.For example, if a stock falls 2% one day, you might get nervous. But if the volume is far below average, it could be a sign that the larger investors who really drive the market are not selling aggressively. They're sitting tight, and maybe you should, too.Conversely, if a stock shows a nice gain but the number of shares traded is unusually low, that could mean it's just a head fake. If big investors were aggressively scooping up shares, you'd see a big spike in volume.These types of telltale clues — which you can only spot by using charts — let you see what is really going on with the stock.Moving Average LinesThe moving average lines simply track the share price movement over a set period of time. But they are absolutely crucial to understanding if a stock is being enthusiastically supported — or aggressively sold — by large investors.It's the big mutual fund managers and other institutional investors who have the buying power to push a stock sharply higher — or lower. And these money managers often use the moving averages as a point where they step in to protect and add to their positions.But watch out if a stock fails to find support at a key moving average like the 10-week or 50-day line. When a stock crashes below those benchmarks in heavy volume, it often means the stock has fallen out of favor with the big players.So always watch how your stocks behave when they're trading around their moving averages. Based on how they act, you'll know if it's time to buy, sell or just sit tight.Relative Strength LineWant a quick way to instantly see if your stock is a leader or a laggard? Check the relative strength (RS) line, which compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500.A sharply rising RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market. An RS line that's trending down shows the stock is lagging the market.When a stock is nearing a potential breakout, look for the RS line to be rising and approaching or in new-high ground. Such action is a bullish sign of market leadership as a stock tries to launch a new run.What's In A Weekly Stock Chart?What's In A Daily Stock Chart?Newer investors often ask, Should I use daily or weekly charts? What's the difference between the two?The short answer is use both.The weekly chart gives you a longer-term perspective on the stock and its underlying trend. It also helps smooth out the daily price fluctuations so you can stay grounded and not get overly swayed by day-to-day volatility.The daily chart gives you a valuable look at the price and volume action at specific, time-sensitive moments, such as on the day of a breakout or when a stock is testing its 50-day line. On those occasions, the shorter-term daily charts help reveal the current ""story"" and what action you should take.So be sure look at both the weekly and daily charts. You can easily switch between the two using IBD Charts.In the next installment in this series on how to read stock charts, we'll go over in more detail the three key factors to look for in a chart: current trend, price and volume action, and support and resistance.Once you understand those concepts, you'll be ready to spot — and profit from — chart patterns like the cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.In the meantime, use the links below to immediately start improving your chart reading skills:Chart Reading For Beginners: 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Your StocksChart Reading For Beginners: How To Spot The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsHow To Buy Stocks | When To Sell StocksImprove Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineRelated Books: How To Make Money In Stocks — Getting Started | Success Stories

The funds held about $91 million in assets at the end of May, according to the company.The closures come even as BlackRock puts greater emphasis on factor investing, a trading strategy that selects investments based on tested drivers of return, such as volatility, size and value. In April, the company introduced Factor Box, a tool that aims to ""democratize"" the strategy and illuminate it for more investors. BlackRock estimated that by 2022 the factor industry's assets under management will expand to $3.4 trillion from $1.9 trillion in 2017.Melissa Garville, a spokeswoman for BlackRock, declined to comment beyond the news release.Earlier this year, BlackRock unveiled a suite of ETFs that use data science and some machine learning to better define company sectors.

527,A,"Housing: With home prices soaring in most markets, this is the best time to be a homeowner since 2005. But there's a downside: Thanks to continued government meddling, the housing market has rarely been more fragile. Is another housing crunch brewing?We've talked before about the strength of the U.S. economy, particularly after tax cuts kicked in. And that's still true. Unfortunately, 10 years after the 2008 financial crisis, there's one exception: The housing market, which, despite superficial signs of health, remains dysfunctional.Homeowners are happy now, but they may soon be reeling. The Fed, worried about ultralow 3.8% unemployment and rising incomes, has signaled it could raise rates as many as seven times between now and the end of 2019. Not only would new buyers no longer qualify to buy homes, but homeowners who bought during the Fed's zero-interest rate days might get a severe shock as payments surge and buyer demand dries up.Right now, housing suffers from an affordability crisis. Despite median household income rising strongly since President Trump took office, the average price for a new home today is just under $330,000, vs. about $248,000 in 2006, before the last housing crisis. Higher Fed rates followed by a downturn in housing prices would devastate the U.S. economy.How did we get here? Unfortunately, you can blame government. Neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that caused the 2007 housing meltdown, were dismantled. Instead, Washington rewarded them with an even larger role than before.""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while still in conservatorship and with the blessing of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, are once again expanding into new products and programs with abandon — and in the process potentially adversely affecting industries, businesses and careers,"" wrote Edward J. Pinto, co-director of the American Enterprise Institute's Center on Housing Markets and Finance, and Tom La Malfa, a 40-year mortgage industry veteran, in the American Banker.Only one difference: Now taxpayers own the two housing-finance delinquents. Thus when the next housing meltdown occurs, taxpayers will own it. And they'll have to decide whether to bail out homeowners and banks, or just blame it all on ""deregulation"" and greedy Wall Street, as happened last time.In the meantime, despite high home prices, Fannie and Freddie continue to pump money into heavily subsidized mortgages, artificially boosting home prices. This is not how free markets work.In the next housing crisis, banks will hold hundreds of billions in bad loans and the economy will again crater. Then what? Rather than waiting for disaster, why not do what we should've done years ago? Either privatize Fannie and Freddie or shut them down, while the economy's strong and we still have time.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Dodd-Frank: Taking A Chisel, Not A Hammer, To This Awful Law Isn't Enough — But It's A StartCan New Fed Chief Powell Avoid Fed's Past Disastrous Mistakes?Will Gov't Regulation Kill The Housing Market — Again?

529,A,"It's a hard fact to face sometimes. Not all your swing trades are going to work. But cutting losses quickly keeps the damage of any individual trade at a minimum. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) provides an example. Taking action quickly avoided potential heartache down the road. For long-term performance, that gives you a greater chance at success.Investors had a strong reaction to Chipotle's earnings on April 26, pushing the stock up nearly 25% (1). What really stood out was the tight action over the next few weeks. The stock hardly gave up any gains. Plus, the declining volume suggested very few investors were selling.On May 16, Chipotle Mexican Grill cleared its consolidation as volume picked up (2). It joined IBD's SwingTrader on the positive action. Of course, the expectation was for continued gains. However, market weakness contributed to a pullback. The stock hadn't broken its support levels, so cutting it completely seemed unnecessary. But if it couldn't follow up on the strength, could this provide profits quickly?Reducing the position by half on May 18 acted as a compromise (3). If the weakness continued, the early sell reduces the overall loss. For swing trades, if the losses stay small, it allows the gains to compound and grow your portfolio. If the stock comes back, it can either be repurchased or at the very least turn the trade profitable. In this case, Chipotle Mexican Grill didn't really do either. It didn't see a decisive close below its 5-day moving average. But it couldn't seem to rise back above it. The 10-day moving average provided a level of support that seemed to hold. That is, until May 25 (4).Once Chipotle punctured its 10-day moving average, it was hard to justify holding any longer. Granted, the volume was minimal and the action continued to be tight. But if your stock can't make progress after holding it for more than a week, it's usually time to move on to the next swing trade. Even if the stock doesn't plummet, it may just require more time before it works. There's little reason to risk a downturn in the stock if it needs more time anyway. It's safer in cash, or even better, could be used for another prospect. The fact that the market was mostly sideways during the time made the decision that much easier.The average gain for IBD SwingTrader in 2018 is close to 5% in an average of seven days. Scaling out with the early sell kept the loss for the entire trade under 2%. The handling of Chipotle reduced the loss of money and time on a nonperforming stock.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Long-Term Stock Profits Mean Cutting Losses Quickly In Swing TradesWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

531,A,"When to sell a good stock is critical.When a winner starts losing, the investor who rode the stock all the way up is sometimes slow to recognize a change in character. Hasn't the stock declined before only to form a fresh base and take off? Why should the current decline be any different?This can be a problem for patient investors, especially if they focus too much on fundamentals. Many stocks begin to fail well before the fundamentals suggest trouble.One sell signal that is sometimes overlooked is the stock that lives extensively below the 10-week moving average.A stock that closes below its 10-week line for eight or nine consecutive weeks should in most cases be sold. Admittedly, this sell signal can be a late signal. Late selling, however, will beat stubborn holding most of the time.Investing is seldom about perfect timing on the buy and perfect timing on the sale. A realistic investor concentrates on making money in between the extremes.WebMD Health was a turnaround candidate in 2009. Earnings fell 92% in 2008, then rebounded to gains of 140% and 717% in 2009-10. The stock cleared a base in June 2009 and rose 76% in 10 months.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDuring the advance, WebMD closed under the 10-week line only once — in October 2009, but quickly recovered.Three weeks after the stock hit the 76% profit level in mid-April 2010, the stock slammed 8% lower for the week in heavy volume, violating its 10-week line (1). Many investors would've exited the position with that emphatic sell signal.WebMD recovered some but continued to have trouble staying above the 10-week line.The trouble at the 10-week line represented a change in character. Yet, some investors might have decided to hold the stock through the next base-building process.For the next eight months, the stock teased shareholders with a series of shallow bases that led mostly to sideways action.In late April 2011, the stock completed a cup without handle, but then slammed 12% lower for the week in heavy volume (2). Such action would have triggered the 8% loss-cutting sell rule.The stock then lived under its 10-week for nine weeks in a row (3), sinking 27% from its latest base breakout point. Heeding a late sell signal is hard. But it beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, which is what the chart looked like three weeks later (4).A version of this column was first published in the May 16, 2013, edition of IBD.

532,A,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) accepted a sweetened, roughly $71 billion bid from Walt Disney (DIS) for its entertainment assets, dealing a blow to Comcast (CMCSA) efforts to acquire the business.The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December — and $3 above Comcast's bid from last week. The new agreement also offers more flexibility and other enhancements than the Comcast offer, Fox said on Wednesday.At stake is a trove of media properties, ranging from ""The Simpsons"" to ""X-Men,"" that may help fend off the threat from Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming upstarts. Both Disney and Comcast are looking to use the Fox assets to bolster their content and expand overseas.Disney's latest offer is a ""very aggressive move"" by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and may make it difficult for Comcast to respond, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Sweeney. Comcast's current bid was already poised to load the company up with debt, and its shares have fallen 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Comcast's balance sheet may preclude it from bidding much higher,"" Sweeney said. ""Further hampering Comcast's ability to respond is its position that it does not want to use its stock in a deal at these low levels.""The AT&T EffectThe tussle follows the AT&T (T) victory over the Justice Department in its antitrust battle to take over Time Warner. That outcome is expected to spur a wave of media consolidation, emboldening companies to get more aggressive with deals.The Disney-Comcast contest will determine who controls much of Rupert Murdoch's empire, including Fox's movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc.But the two sides aren't vying for all of Fox. Part of the business will be used to create an entity called ""New Fox,"" which will include the highly lucrative Fox News, the sports channels FS1 and FS2, and the Fox broadcasting channel. That operation will be run by Lachlan Murdoch and focus on domestic television, news and sports.Disney's new offer gives Fox shareholders the option to take their payment in the form of cash or stock, up to a 50-50 level. The previous agreement was an all-stock deal, and Comcast's cash offer was seen as a significant enticement.Disney also plans to take on about $13.8 billion of Fox's net debt. That would lift the total transaction value above about $85 billion.Meanwhile, there's a separate — yet intertwined — fight for Sky, the British pay-TV company. Fox has attempted to acquire the portion of Sky that it doesn't already own, but Comcast swooped in with a higher bid.In any case, Comcast isn't likely to go away quietly.Comcast's current $65 billion cash offer for Fox — along with the potential Sky deal — was already expected to push its debt load to $170 billion, according to Moody's Investors Service. That leaves CEO Brian Roberts with some tough decisions.""The ball is now in Brian Roberts's court,"" Sweeney said.Walt Disney stock rose 1% before the open on the stock market today. 21st Century Fox, which will retain the Fox broadcasting channel, Fox News and some assets, leapt 6.5% to 47.60.

Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though.

534,A,"Sportswear behemoth Nike (NKE) stock has exploded to new highs after the Dow Jones athletic apparel and shoe giant crushed earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday and announced a $15 billion stock buyback.The mix of fresh products, increasing demand at home and abroad, and accelerating digital innovation could drive Nike's stock price even higher, according to Wedbush Securities footwear analyst Christopher Svezia. Indeed, he was so impressed with the Dow Jones firm's results he claimed that 2018 is shaping up to be ""the Year of Nike.""""Improved design and technologies and sufficient quantities (are) being brought to market with better speed (boosted by Express Lanes), whether with React (expanding more into Sportswear now as well), the Air Max platform (with 270s, Vapor Max, and more), or NBA,"" Svezia said in a research note.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike CEO Mark Parker says Express Lanes cuts down the time between a product's design and its appearance on the shelves from months to a few weeks.The wider Consumer Direct Offense strategy aims to make Nike the leader in innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with customers through digital systems, membership and personalization.Nike stock vaulted 11% to 79.68 on the stock market today. Old rival Adidas (ADDYY) rose 2% and new pretender Under Armour (UAA) sank 3.9%.

In April Nike acquired body-scanning software firm Invertex, as it continues to beef up its digital technology, including its artificial intelligence capabilities. And in March it bought consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum.Parker cited Nike's earnings as a harbinger of good things to come, and prove that his strategy is working.""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,"" Parker said in a press release. ""Fueled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for Nike's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.""Meanwhile Svezia believes Nike is underplaying its hand with its outlook. He sees great opportunities in foreign markets, as well as at home. While North American sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, that followed three straight quarters of declines.""There is opportunity in China and Europe in addition to accelerating growth in North America (on greater product availability and favorable comparisons) while gross margin should be supportive,"" he said.Nike is the footwear market leader in China and Cowen managing director John Kernan has said the current boom in popularity in the NBA will disproportionately benefit Nike over other brands.The sunny picture is in stark contrast to 2017, a tough year for the footwear industry in North America. This was despite collective sales of more than $74 billion, according to Euromonitor.Top brands including Nike and Under Armour struggled, while retailers had their own woes due to heavy price promotion.

538,A,"Mideast: While the U.S. remains focused on immigration and a Supreme Court vacancy, Iran is in the middle of a major social convulsion that's verging on a revolution. Last time this happened, President Obama ignored it. This time, the U.S. supports those in the streets.In recent days, headlines such as ""In Iran, revolution is starting in the bazaar,"" ""Clashes Continue in Iran for Third Day After Grand Bazaar Merchant Protest,"" and ""Tehran's Grand Bazaar Shut Down As Economic Protests Spread,"" have run in global media, with little apparent notice.It's a big deal. A very big deal.The 39-year-old dictatorship of the Mullahs in Tehran may be on the verge of dissolving, as Trump imposes new, stiff sanctions on Iran's economy and Iran's currency, the rial, plunges sharply, prices soar and the economy collapses. Average Iranians are losing faith in the government and taking to the streets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTehran's Grand Bazaar, its central meeting place and business center, has been filled with tens of thousands of angry protesters nearly every day. Yet, the media are paying little attention. Neither are average citizens in the West. But it bears close watching.Some chant anti-government slogans, including ""The enemy is here. They (the regime) lie that it is the U.S."" Not lost on average Iranians is the fact that, as Najmeh Bozorgmehr writes in the Financial Times, ""The bazaar played a crucial role in the 1979 Islamic revolution when traders joined forces with the clergy to overthrow Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.""Is history repeating itself?If so, this will remake the entire Mideast. Without the fundamentalists in power, Iran will almost certainly begin modernizing both its economy and its culture. Moreover, the nuclear weapons program that is at the heart of western discontent with Iran could be dismantled.Last time, the U.S. sat and watched, not giving its ally, the Shah, any support. This time is different.The U.S. Treasury under President Trump has already begun to revoke licenses, according to the Associated Press, that let U.S.-controlled foreign companies sell commercial jet parts and oilfield gear to Iran. It also bans sale of Iran's famous carpets, pistachios and caviar in the U.S., major exports for the financially troubled nation.This follows Trump's decision in May to pull out of President Obama's so-called Iran nuclear agreement. That deal didn't halt work on a nuclear weapon; it merely postponed an Iranian nuke by 10 years.Despite criticism from Britain, China, Russia, Germany, France and the European Union, Trump held fast. Angry rhetoric notwithstanding, foreign banks have fallen into line, fearing sanctions from the U.S. Two-thirds of all global trade is conducted in dollars. As sanctions bite and its oil industry struggles, Iran's mullahs are short on cash.By these moves, Trump has empowered the people taking to the streets in Tehran and elsewhere. The last time this happened, during Iran's 2009 ""Green Revolution,"" by comparison, President Obama did nothing. Indeed, within years, Obama had signed a Neville-Chamberlain-style appeasement deal Iran's leaders. Disgracefully, it basically gave them a sure path to a nuclear bomb.It is one of the reasons why Obama and his two Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, will go down in history as the most gullible foreign policy-makers in this nation's history. And that's saying a lot.We had high hopes in the early 2000s when a journalist with access to the White House intimated to us that ""President Bush wouldn't kick this can (Iran) down the road.""He knew the nuclear problem was serious. But he did nothing.Obama was worse by far, actually empowering the Mullahs, and giving them unparalleled influence across the Mideast. He further empowered them by giving them access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets, plus billions in aid, some of which made its way to terrorists.Now Trump's new policy of non-appeasement is taking all that back, yet another reason for being happy that he won and not Tehran-friendly Hillary Clinton. This is a huge issue, since hundreds of thousands of Iranians fled post-Shah Iran for the U.S., and now make America their home.As Ilan Berman of the American Foreign Policy Council wrote this week,  the U.S. has the opportunity to use the Persian-language broadcasting power of the U.S. government, through its Broadcasting Board of Governors. Already, it plans a 24-hour Farsi channel and digital outreach.And both Vice President Pence and former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster showed up on Farsi-language media to support Iran's protesters. It's an important move, on par possibly with President Reagan's support of Solidarity protesters in Poland during the early 1980s.By isolating Tehran's regime, Trump is enabling the Iranian people in their quest for freedom and modernity. We wish them well. Iran is an ancient civilization stretching back thousands of years. It deserves better.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:How Obama Secretly Gave Iran Access To Billions Of Dollars — And Enabled TerrorismTrump Iran Policy Ends Disastrous Obama Era Of Nuclear Appeasement — FinallyIBD/TIPP Poll: Americans Support Tough Trump Stance On Iran Nuclear Deal

544,A,"Arista Networks is a four-year-old cloud stock, a toddler that quickly rose to big-cap status. The coming two quarters presents a test, as the company runs up against two quarters of steep earnings and sales gains in its year-earlier period.Arista Networks (ANET) makes switches and other hardware components for cloud-based networks in large data center and campus-type computing settings. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has become a fierce competitor of Cisco Systems (CSCO). The question is, just how much ground has Cisco taken back in the market for high-performance networking switches?Arista's stock has been basing since February, waiting for a clear answer to that question.During that period, it has formed a four-month base. The base began with a harsh sell-off Feb. 15, as investors responded to comments made during the company's fourth-quarter conference call with analysts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArista had reported a stronger-than-forecast 43% revenue gain and a 62% increase in earnings. Management called 2017 ""a tipping point,"" during which the company's network switches became a mainstay cloud technology providing more than 15 million ports.At the same time, the company said 2017's strong performance meant it would face ""tough comparables"" in 2018. Chief financial officer Ita Brennan projected revenue growth would moderate to the mid-20s, vs. 46% in 2017.The stock dove below its 10-week line. After repeated tests of that low over the next two months, in its first quarter report Arista again topped analysts' sales and earnings targets. Second quarter revenue guidance, however, only narrowly topped expectations.That sent shares for yet another test of its low on May 4. Arista then began to rebound. It has since retaken its 50-day moving average. On Monday, it was up almost 19% from its May 4 low. It now trades less than 8% below a 301.41 buy point in a double-bottom base.For the current quarter, analysts project a 27% earnings-per-share gain to $1.70 and a 26% rise in revenue. If realized, it would be the company's slowest quarter on both lines since at least Q3 2013. Gradually slowing growth is a hallmark of maturing companies and, if well-handled by management, often not a negative for a stock.Arista, which had its IPO in 2014, is still relatively young. But its revenue has grown nearly threefold since 2014, and the its market capitalization quickly expanded to more than $20 billion, giving it big-cap status. At the same time, shares turned in a 465% advance between March and February of 2016. That left the stock in sore need of a breather.From that technical point of view, the current consolidation was due. In fact, investors might be better off if Arista had pulled back all the way below 206 — the low if its prior base. That would have reset the base count.Instead, the stock is gestating in a fourth-stage base. That is late stage, meaning a breakout from the pattern bears more risk than it would if the base had pulled back and reset to become a first-stage structure.But, the market has recently produced a number of leaders able to power out gains well into late stage charts. TAL Education (TAL) is currently struggling to maintain a breakout above a 10th stage base. Heart device maker Abiomed (ABMD) was up 46% on Monday, since clearing a sixth-stage flat base in early May.The point is, being a late-stage stock shouldn't on its own be enough to scare off investors. But precautions should be taken, because late-stage status implies the stock could sell off very quickly if things start to go wrong.RELATED:IBD Stock Of The DayIBD Stock Of The Day: Paycom Nears Buy Point With Earnings Growth Set To AccelerateIPO Stock With 100% Growth May Follow Path Of Alibaba, Facebook OPEC Faces Crumbling Consensus As This Creates Sharp SplitThese 4 Stock Giants Are Near Buy Points

553,A,"Age 65 is when Medicare becomes part of many Americans' lives. That's the age when most people — including many in or near retirement — become eligible for the federal health insurance program. Learning how to sign up for Medicare can be a lifeline for anyone coping with disappointing or expensive private health insurance coverage.But you must pay for parts of its coverage, which may not be cheap. So not everyone should sign up right away. Here's advice about how to decide whether you should join the program, when and how.A good start is critical. David Littell, retirement income program co-director at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Penn., says that the biggest mistake that individuals can make under Medicare is not signing up for Parts A and B on a timely basis.""This could result in catastrophic losses for people who end up in a hospital with an accident or illness, then discover that they have inadequate health insurance coverage,"" Littell said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD'S TAKE: Read this IBD report for practical, easy, real-world advice about how to save an extra $20 per week for retirement, even if you have a very tight budget.What is a timely basis? The key date is four months before your 65th birthday.Here's how it works. Say a hypothetical Joan Hall turns 65 in August 2018. If she was receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board benefits at least four months earlier, in April 2018, Hall does not have to do anything.Hall's Medicare enrollment will start automatically. Usually, it starts the first day of the month someone is 65.Coverage does not start automatically for people who are not receiving federal retirement benefits at least four months before age 65. They must take action: signing up for Medicare. When you're first eligible, there is a seven-month window.Say Hall was not receiving Social Security in April. Her time window runs from May 2018 through November 2018. That's three months before her 65th birthday in August through three months after.During this time, Hall can apply for Medicare Part A. That mainly covers hospital costs. Most people get coverage for free.Hall also can sign up for Medicare Part B. That covers medical costs such as doctors' visits.Not everyone signs up for Part B at 65, even if they get Part A. If you get your health insurance through an employer with 20 or more employers, check with the benefits manager. Why? If you have coverage by a so-called qualified group plan whose costs and benefits compare well with Medicare, stay in the group and delay signing up for Medicare Part B.The same is true if your health insurance is through your spouse and the coverage's costs and benefits are better than Medicare's.Otherwise, consider switching to Medicare.Medicare advises people who get health insurance through a smaller firm to sign up for Parts A & B when first eligible. The same typically goes for seniors without employer coverage.There is no built-in benefit for delaying Medicare as there is for waiting to start Social Security. The advantage to postponing Part B is to avoid paying the premiums until you begin.In 2018, the standard monthly premium for Part B is $134 per person. Enrollees with high incomes pay as much as $428.60 a month. (This year's premiums are based on 2016 income.)For people who delay Part B, there may be a penalty. Your premium rises by 10% for each full 12-month period that you put off enrolling.So you have a year after the seven-month initial enrollment period ends to get Part B and avoid the penalty. Other exceptions may apply, such as continuing coverage from a group health plan.If you won't start Medicare automatically, you must take steps to enroll. One possibility is to go online to (https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib). You can go through the process and choose Medicare only.You also can call Social Security at 800-772-1213. Or visit your local Social Security office.During your initial enrollment period, there are other choices. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage Plan, known as Part C.Those Part C Advantage plans, run by private companies, generally have networks of doctors and hospitals. If you stay in the network, you may pay less to insurance companies for coverage and to health care providers for their services than you would with basic (""original"") Medicare.One reason: you won't pay for a Medigap insurance policy. Medigap is supplementary health insurance that covers some health care costs not covered by original Medicare, such as co-payments and deductibles. Medigap policies sold after Jan. 1, 2006 aren't allowed to provide prescription drug coverage, which is offered by Part D plans. Plan F, the most popular of Medigap's many versions, has a national average annual cost over $1,700.And Advantage plans usually have prescription drug coverage.Without an Advantage plan, you may want Medigap as well as a Part D plan that covers drug costs. With Medicare Advantage or original Medicare, you'll still owe the Part B premium.So check local Advantage plans as well as the available Medigap and Part D policies. Don't worry if you're not happy with your first choice — you can change your selection each year, during the annual Medicare open enrollment period from mid-October to early December.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Four Ways You Can Cut Retirement Costs — With Little SacrificeHow To Apply For Social Security Benefits: What You Need To Know

The stock, an IBD Dividend Leader, had just reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings growth of 7%, just meeting analyst views.Revenue rose a better-than-expected 16%. On Thursday, a handful of analysts rolled out reports reiterating ratings at hold, neutral, market perform and equal weight — pretty much what you expect from an unassuming income stock.But Paychex' stock has periodically been a highflier. Since the market's 2008-09 downturn, Paychex shares have averaged an 11.7% gain per year. That included a 3% decline in 2011, a 46% surge in 2013 and four smaller double-digit annual gains. Otherwise, the stock has stuck to small single-digit gains.In March, Paychex announced it would acquire Denmark-based Lessor Group. Lessor gives Paychex entry to markets in Northern Europe. No terms were reported on the deal, but it showed the cash-rich Paychex starting to look further afield for growth opportunities.Paychex President and Chief Executive Martin Mucci said the company aimed to expand beyond European operations currently limited largely to Germany.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The slip left the stock down 5% since starting what could become a handle on a six-month cup base.

556,A,"Netflix (NFLX) and Square (SQ) are clear stock market leaders, with both extending gains Wednesday to hit new all-time highs. But if you have a position in one of these surging top stocks, you might consider locking in some of those gains – even with Netflix stock up 2.9% and Square stock up 2.5% in the stock market today.Video streaming giant Netflix is up a whopping 117% so far in 2018, while Square has surged 97%. Not only do these all-star stocks have strong technical action, their fundamentals are equally strong.While Netflix and Square still have compelling growth stories, the extended nature of their stocks may warrant taking some profits.FANG stock Netflix is now extended 23% past the 338.92 flat-base buy point cleared on May 23, after reaching the 20% profit milestone in Tuesday's session.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSquare stock is nearing a profit zone, with a 15% gain from a cup-base buy point of 58.56. A slightly earlier handle entry, which is technically too short and doesn't show up on the weekly chart, puts the stock at a 19% gain from a 57.29 buy point.It's important to note that both of these bases are late-stage bases, further underscoring the huge moves these hot tech stocks have already seen. Late-stage bases can work, but are more prone to failure.We identify the profit-taking zone as a 20%-25% gain from a buy point. The rule states that once a stock becomes this far extended past a proper entry, that's usually a good time to sell part of your position to secure some gains.Investors may want to take partial profits at this stage because our research shows that top stocks typically pull back once reaching these levels.Square stock, for instance, gained 22% from a cup-with-handle breakout in March, and then the stock dropped as much as 23% before starting to rebound higher.And Netflix stock pulled back as much as 18% after a powerful breakout in January before continuing its move higher – though the stock gained some 40% from the buy point before that correction.The latter is an example of why you wouldn't want to sell your entire position simply because the stock hits that 20% profit mark. Make sure to look at other key indicators, such as price and volume action and broader market conditions, when making buying and selling decisions.Taking profits all comes down to your level of conviction in a stock, and whether you're willing to sit through declines in order to give winning stocks room to run. But sticking to buy and sell rules is a sound strategy that helps prevent you from making poor investing decisions. It's key to remember that the bright side of pullbacks is they can result in fresh buying opportunities.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Micron Earnings Lift These 5 Memory-Chip PlaysNetflix Stock Is On Leaderboard, IBD's Curated List Of Leading Growth StocksFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

593,A,"President Trump aimed his Twitter fire at Europe on Friday, saying a 20% Trump tariff could soon apply to cars imported from Germany and the rest of the European Union. The threat comes as General Motors said it will build its new Blazer SUV in Mexico, highlighting the difficulty Trump is having in getting automakers to bend to his will.""Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!""

But VW and Daimler stock soon turned higher, closing up 0.4% and 0.25%. Daimler tumbled 4.5% Thursday to an 18-month low after warning that U.S.-China trade war tariffs would hurt earnings.General Motors (GM) rose 0.3% while Ford (F) edged down 0.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier in the week, news reports emerged that Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz autos, and other German automakers were pitching a reciprocal elimination of tariffs. The Wall Street Journal reported that Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany was to present the offer to Trump this week.Trump has criticized the European Union's 10% tax on U.S. auto imports, which compares to just a 2.5% U.S. tax on European cars. The German automakers said they backed scrapping the tariffs on both sides but added that they want the U.S. to eliminate a 25% tax on light trucks, such as SUVs and pickups.That 25% ""chicken"" tax has been in place since 1964, when the Lyndon Johnson administration initially applied it as punishment for Europe's tax on U.S. chicken imports, but the protectionist measure outlived that conflict.Given his Friday tweet renewing the threat of a 20% Trump tariff, it seems safe to say that the president didn't appreciate the German offer and has no intention of opening up the U.S. to stiffer light-truck import competition. Bottom line: The mounting trade dispute with Europe may well intensify.Meanwhile, Trump may have little recourse in challenging GM's move to build SUVs in Mexico. As part of NAFTA, Mexico isn't subject to the 25% tax on SUVs. While Trump has periodically threatened to pull out of NAFTA and negotiations have gotten bogged down, he seems reticent to blow up the trade agreement, risking big price hikes and job losses in the U.S.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenHow Trump Tariffs May Hurt Boeing, Lockheed's Fighter Jet Contest ChancesTwo Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep TumblingStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

609,A,"earnings then stocks could react positively,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note on Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor JPMorgan, Wall Street expects a 23% jump in earnings per share to $2.23. Analysts see revenue up 8% to $27.54 billion.Also expected: CEO Jamie Dimon, who missed JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call in April, will be in attendance. Dimon often uses the bank's quarterly earnings to weigh in on the economy and Washington. His reflections on the economy in earnings releases and annual shareholder letters have the feel of a Warren Buffet-esque fireside chat. His remarks on earnings calls? Not always so much.""He has the potential to create some fireworks here,"" Shanahan said of Dimon. ""I'm kind of looking forward to what he has to say about Trump's policies as it relates to corporate taxes, tariffs, and this trade war, which, arguably, we're in now.""Dimon's return would reunite him with his more measured counterpart, CFO Marianne Lake, who tends to do most of the talking during the calls.Lake, after the bank's first-quarter results in April, said it was too early to tell if businesses were borrowing more due to tax cuts. Earlier that month, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncertainty to the global economic system.""The Trump administration this week said it planned to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. Those duties, which would come on top of tariffs that hit $34 billion in Chinese products last week, could take hold in August following a review period.JPMorgan's stock twitched 0.2% lower to 106.39 on the stock market today. That's essentially where the stock was at the beginning of the year.At the core of investors' anxiety over the banks is the yield curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt. The yield curve is also a reflection on investors' longer-term expectations of inflation and the strength of an economy able to get away with higher prices.Short-term rates influence the rates at which banks borrow money from depositors. The long end influences the rates they set on money they lend to others. Banks' margins depend on the gap between those two.The Fed has bumped up short-term rates, in turn pushing up what banks can charge on things like credit-card and auto loans. But the long end has wavered, reflecting a dimmer view of the economy further out.Citigroup is expected to report a 23% increase in EPS to $1.56, as revenue increases 3% to $18.46 billion.The bank is the most internationally exposed of the big banks, drawing only half of its revenue from North America last year, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Fourteen percent came from Latin America.Citigroup has been bullish on business prospects in Mexico, saying in April that it expected ""continued revenue growth"" in the nation. Citi at that time also noted ""momentum"" in its card and retail banking businesses there.Mexico, however, this month elected as president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a staunch leftist who rode a populist, anti-establishment wave to victory. He has called Trump ""erratic and arrogant."" But after his election win, he said he would aim for ""friendly relations"" with the U.S. Obrador has also said he wants Mexico to stay in NAFTA.KBW last month also noted that Citigroup, at a recent conference, said ""the economy (in Mexico) could slow either on the back of no NAFTA or renegotiated NAFTA or an outcome of a presidential election on July 1."" But the bank still remained bullish on growth.Citigroup dipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Shares are down 8% year-to-date.Zacks forecasts a 5% increase in Wells Fargo's earnings per share to $1.12. Revenue is seen slipping 3% to $21.58 billion.Wells Fargo is still trying to recover following revelations that it created unauthorized customer accounts in an attempt to boost sales. Since then, suspicions have grown in other areas of its business. The Federal Reserve in February restricted Wells Fargo's growth, saying it was responding to ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.""""Management feels comfortable that scandals are in the past, but we believe only time will tell,"" KBW analysts said after the company's investor day in May.Shares lost 1% Wednesday.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Futures: Stock Market Rally Is Missing This Key ElementS&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Economy Adds 213,000 Jobs As Jobless Rate Rises To 4%: Goldilocks ReturnsBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

610,A,"Critics of Donald Trump claim there is no rhyme or reason to his foreign policy. But if there is a consistency, it might be called reciprocity.Trump tries to force other countries to treat the U.S. as it treats them. In ""don't tread on me"" style, he also warns enemies that any aggressive act will be replied to in kind.The underlying principle of Trump commercial reciprocity it that the United States is no longer powerful or wealthy enough to alone underwrite the security of the West. It can no longer assume sole enforcement of the rules and protocols of the postwar global order.This year there have been none of the usual Iranian provocations — frequent during the Obama administration — of harassing American ships in the Persian Gulf. Apparently, the Iranians now realize that anything they do to an American ship will be replied to with overwhelming force.Ditto North Korea. After lots of threats from Kim Jong Un about using his new ballistic missiles against the United States, Trump warned that he would use America's far greater arsenal to eliminate North Korea's arsenal for good.Trump is said to be undermining NATO by questioning its usefulness some 69 years after its founding. Yet unlike 1948, Germany is no longer down. The United States is always in. And Russia is hardly out, but instead cutting energy deals with the Europeans.More importantly, most NATO countries have failed to keep their promises to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet the vast majority of the 29 alliance members are far closer than the U.S. to the dangers of Middle East terrorism and supposed Russian bullying.Why does Germany by design run up a $65 billion annual trade surplus with the United States? Why does such a wealthy country spend only 1.2% of its GDP on defense? And if Germany has entered into energy agreements with a supposedly dangerous Vladimir Putin, why does it still need to have its security subsidized by the American military?Trump approaches NAFTA in the same reductionist way. The 24-year-old treaty was supposed to stabilize, if not equalize, all trade, immigration and commerce between the three supposed North American allies.It never quite happened that way. Unequal tariffs remained. Both Canada and Mexico have substantial trade surpluses with the U.S. In Mexico's case, it enjoys a $71 billion surplus, the largest of U.S. trading partners with the exception of China.Canada never honored its NATO security commitment. It spends only 1% of its GDP on defense, rightly assuming that the U.S. will continue to underwrite its security.During the lifetime of NAFTA, Mexico has encouraged millions of its citizens to enter the U.S. illegally. Mexico's selfish immigration policy is designed to avoid internal reform, to earn some $30 billion in annual expatriate remittances, and to influence U.S. politics.Yet after more than two decades of NAFTA, Mexico is more unstable than ever. Cartels run entire states. Murders are at a record high. Entire towns in southern Mexico have been denuded of their young males, who crossed the U.S. border illegally.The U.S. runs a huge trade deficit with China. The red ink is predicated on Chinese dumping, patent and copyright infringement, and outright cheating. Beijing illegally occupies neutral islands in the South China Sea, militarizes them and bullies it neighbors.All of the above has become the ""normal"" globalized world.But in 2016, red-state America rebelled at the asymmetry. The other half of the country demonized the red-staters as protectionists, nativists, isolationists, populists and nationalists.However, if China, Europe and other U.S. trading partners had simply followed global trading rules, there would have been no Trump pushback — and probably no Trump presidency at all.Had NATO members and NAFTA partners just kept their commitments, and had Mexico not encouraged millions of its citizens to crash the U.S. border, there would now be little tension between allies.Instead, what had become abnormal was branded the new normal of the postwar world.Again, a rich and powerful U.S. was supposed to subsidize world trade, take in more immigrants than all the nations of the world combined, protect the West, and ensure safe global communications, travel and commerce.After 70 years, the effort had hollowed out the interior of America, creating two separate nations of coastal winners and heartland losers.Trump's entire foreign policy can be summed up as a demand for symmetry from all partners and allies, and tit-for-tat replies to would-be enemies.Did Trump have to be so loud and often crude in his effort to bully America back to reciprocity?Who knows?But it seems impossible to imagine that globalist John McCain, internationalist Barack Obama or gentlemanly Mitt Romney would ever have called Europe, NATO, Mexico, and Canada to account, or warned Iran or North Korea that tit would be met by tat.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

613,A,"There's an interesting debate going on around cybersecurity titan and IBD Sector Leader Palo Alto Networks (PANW). After a big run already, is it too late to buy?A stock gets extended when it moves too far past a proper entry point to be actionable. A common pitfall for many growth investors is to buy a stock too late after a big price run already.But whether or not Palo Alto Networks is extended is open to interpretation.For those that view the cybersecurity stock as extended after a breakout from a base in mid-January, one option is to wait and see if it can eventually form a flat base. It's been a shallow pullback so far, but it's only been consolidating gains for three-and-a-half weeks. The minimum time frame for a flat base is five weeks. Watch for continued tight trading above the 10-week moving average.Palo Alto Networks cleared the 156.95 buy point on June 18, but it wasn't a conviction breakout by any means. It could only muster a 2.5% gain from the buy point before pulling back to its 10-week moving average. It fell 5% below the buy point, not enough to trigger a sell signal, such as the golden rule, and the breakout gained traction after that.Another reasonable interpretation is that Palo Alto cleared a long cup-with-handle base with a 191.63 buy point during the week ended April 6. In this case, Palo Alto is still in buy range as it gets support at the 10-week moving average.The network security company, with a market capitalization of nearly $20 billion, continues to trade near highs as the stock market anticipates more market share gains.In its latest reported quarter, earnings per share jumped 62% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales increased 31% to $567.1 million.In March, Palo Alto closed its acquisition of Calif.-based Evident.io, a leader in public cloud services infrastructure protection, for $300 million.In April, it bought Israel-based Secdo, an endpoint detection and response (EDR) firm.

615,A,"Corporate Correctness: Starbucks won raves from environmentalists for its ban on straws. But while a strawless Starbucks won't do anything to help the environment, it will discriminate against the disabled. Virtue signaling can be a tricky business.Under pressure from environmentalists, the coffee giant says that it will replace plastic straws with sippy-cup style lids at all of its stores by 2020. The company isn't the first to do so, although it is the biggest. Hilton and Marriott hotels said they're removing plastic straws at many of their hotels. American Airlines said it will get rid of plastic straws starting this November. Various cities have or plan to impose bans.Why have straws become the bête noire of the green lobby and progressive CEOs? Because some straws end up in the ocean.We'll concede that polluting the oceans with plastic is bad. But environmentalists aggressively pushing this straw ban are using phony statistics while ignoring the real problem.Almost every story on banning plastic straws cites the same statistic — that Americans use 500 million straws a day — which is based on a 9-year-old's ""research"" project he did in 2011. (A more reliable estimate is 175 million.)Whatever the number, straw bans in the U.S. will have virtually no impact on the world's plastic pollution problem. Not only do straws represent a tiny portion of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean, but the U.S. itself accounts for less than 1% of the marine plastic in the world's oceans, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Science. Europe's coastal countries, by contrast, account for almost 3%.Just five countries — China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka — are responsible for more than half of the plastic entering the ocean each year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat's because, unlike those other countries, the U.S. has better waste management systems in place — which keeps most of our trash in landfills or recycling centers, and out of the oceans. The Science study notes that just 2% of the waste in the U.S. is ""mismanaged,"" compared with 76% in China, 90% in North Korea, 88% in Vietnam, and 87% in India.Another study, published in Environmental Science & Technology late last year, found that the Yangtze River alone dumps 1.5 million metric tons of plastic into the ocean a year — roughly 19% of the world's annual total.Given these realities, eliminating straws from a few hotels and Starbucks chains won't even amount to, pardon the expression, a drop in the ocean.What's more, Starbucks will likely end up using more plastic after the ban than before.According to Reason magazine's Christian Britschgi, the replacement lid Starbucks is likely to use contains up to 15% more plastic by weight than the current lid-and-straw combo. Starbucks, he reports, did not address, nor did it dispute, that its transition to strawless lids would increase its overall plastic consumption.But while Starbucks' ban will do nothing for the environment, it will bring harm to the disabled community, who have been speaking out more aggressively against straw bans.""Plastic straws are an accessible way for people with certain disabilities to consume food and drinks, and it seems the blanket bans are not taking into account that they need straws and also that plastic straw replacements are not accessible to people."" Katherine Carroll, policy analyst at the Rochester, New York-based Center for Disability Rights, told Time magazine.Karin Hitselberger, a disability advocate in Washington, D.C., writes in the Washington Post that she and other ""people with a huge range of disabilities depend on plastic straws to access beverages and the very water they need to survive: cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis, among many others.""""For so many people with disabilities,"" she goes on, ""something as mundane as a straw represents independence and freedom. And the conversation around their environmental impact, without consideration of who uses straws and why, demonstrates how people with disabilities are often forgotten.""So, congratulations Starbucks and all the rest of the woke companies and cities now engaged in the battle against Big Straw.

616,A,"Zogenix (ZGNX) stock rocketed to a record high Thursday after its anti-seizure drug outperformed expectations — just a month after GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) grabbed approval for a rival medicine.On the stock market today, Zogenix stock popped 20.7%, to close at an all-time high, at 55.90. GW, which recently gained approval for a rival anti-seizure drug called Epidiolex, initially tumbled several percentage points during the regular trading session but was up 3.4% at the closing bell to 149.83.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted the ""highly impressive results"" in combination with a clean safety profile will likely lead the Food and Drug Administration to grant Zogenix's drug expedited approval. Its anti-seizure drug, called ZX008, is a treatment for Dravet syndrome.""Based on this result, we expect Zogenix to file and receive expedited approval from the FDA, with a likely mid-2019 launch,"" Porges said in a note to clients. Zogenix noted in a press release it plans to file for approval in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter of 2018.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseZogenix tested ZX008 as a treatment for Dravet syndrome, a rare epileptic disorder that begins in infancy. GW grabbed approval for the only treatment for Dravet syndrome last month. GW's drug is derived completely from the cannabis plant.But Zogenix is closing in with its second pivotal study of ZX008. In the test, Zogenix studied its anti-seizure drug in patients also taking another anti-seizure drug called stiripentol. Physicians use stiripentol as a treatment for Dravet syndrome in Europe.""We did not believe the addition of stiripentol as a background anti-seizure medicine in (the test called) Study 2 would have a meaningful impact on the baseline seizure rate or effect of ZX008 in this trial, and our stance has been confirmed with today's data,"" Porges said.In the study, patients treated with ZX008 experienced a median 62.7% drop in monthly convulsive seizures. This compares with a median 1.2% reduction for patients on the placebo.At a dose of 0.5 milligrams per day, 53.5% of patients reported their monthly convulsive seizures dropped by at least half, vs. just 6.8% of placebo-treated patients. Nearly a third of ZX008 patients, 32.6%, experienced at least a 75% cut in monthly convulsive seizures, vs. 2.3% in the placebo group.At the median, the longest seizure-free interval was 22 days vs. 13 days on the placebo.Patients tolerated the anti-seizure medicine and side effects were in line with other studies. The most common adverse events among ZX008-treated patients were decreased appetite, diarrhea, fever, fatigue and a cold. Porges noted the press release didn't mention any heart valve issues.This ""supports the case that safety will not be a barrier for the approval of this medicine,"" he said.RELATED:Why These Biotech Stocks Could Spike In The Second Half Of 2018Can You Make Roaring Stock Profits With A Little Cash?

Both small caps and large caps could not escape the selling in stocks today. Some retailers sold off especially hard.At 2 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average led the sell-off and traded near session lows Wednesday, down 0.9%; the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% to 0.8%. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time Tuesday on the Nasdaq but was slightly lower on the NYSE.The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped 0.7%.Utilities advanced.

NYSE Spotlight stocks are up a collective 6.2%.While the stocks in Sector Leaders change often, a few have excelled.Abiomed (ABMD) is the single biggest contribution to Sector Leader's success. The stock has about doubled this year, having started its impressive run with a breakout the first week of this year past a 200.38 buy point. The stock is now testing support in a pullback to the 10-week moving average.Abiomed makes the Impella heart pump. Goldman Sachs says Impella faces little competition for at least two to three years. With expanded use in medical applications and new territories, Abiomed's total market could grow to $30 billion, Goldman analysts have said.Salesforce.com (CRM) has risen about 35% after a breakout past 109.29 in early January. The company is a leader in customer relationship software, with an estimated 20% of the global market in 2017.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the biggest names in cybersecurity, and one of the most profitable. It shares with Qualys (QLYS) the highest EPS Rating of 30 companies in the security software industry group. Shares broke out Jan. 18 at 156.95 and are up nearly 40% from there, at record highs.Five Below (FIVE) was having a mediocre year, until early June. Most of the stock's 2018 gains happened the week ended June 8, when shares soared 42%. At that time, the fast-growing chain of popular and trendy items that sell of $5 or less beat earnings expectations and gave a bullish outlook.The company announced a new distribution center near Atlanta that will aid its expansion in the Southeast.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) has had an up-and-down year, but it's up about 37% year to date. The subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG) saw its best move after a breakout April 5 from a 26.29 proper buy point. Viper is not on the current Sector Leaders list.In the long term, Sector Leader stocks as a whole have outperformed as well. The screen is up 34% in the past 12 months vs. 13.5% for the S&P 500. Since the start of the bull market on March 6, 2009, Sector Leaders is up more than 750% compared with 306% for the S&P 500.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Can This Medical Technology Innovator Outrun Its Stock Chart Risks?Salesforce Thrives As Software-As-A-Service Market Booms

620,A,"Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk fulfilled a long-term goal by signing agreements with Chinese authorities Tuesday that allows it to open a China car factory in the city of Shanghai, local media reported.XThe factory would have an annual capacity of 500,000 cars and give it roots in the world's biggest market.In addition to helping Musk sell more cars, having a China production facility would help it avoid costly tariffs.The automaker's stock closed at 322.47, up 1.2% on the stock market today. The stock rose 3% Monday as Bloomberg reported that Musk was headed to China.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday it was reported that Tesla prices on the Model S and X have risen about 20% in China, or about $20,000 apiece, following that country's first round of retaliatory tariffs in the trade war with the U.S. last week. The measures initiated by the Chinese government follow tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on China goods.China has been one of Tesla's core markets, but the price hike due to tariffs will likely put a dent in demand. In February, the automaker said it had more than 1,000 Superchargers and 2,000 Destination Chargers across China. The company has also expanded its retail and service presence to more than 35 locations in 2017.Musk has also talked about adding a ""gigafactory"" in China. That could be used to build autos as well as batteries. The China plant would be its second car-manufacturing facility.Tesla currently builds all its cars at an assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. It also has a battery factory in Nevada. Musk also has said Tesla will build a car-manufacturing plant in Europe, suggesting Germany might be the location.RELATED:Can Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?Trump Tariffs On China, June Jobs Report: Investing Action Plan

The line had been acting as resistance for more than two weeks and could now become support.The 50-day line often acts as a test area. When either a stock or an index trade above the line, the 50-day can act as a test for support. When the price is below the line, the 50-day can act as resistance.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.7%. The small cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.6% pop.Volume rose on both major exchanges compared to the same time Friday.In the blue chip Dow, Caterpillar (CAT) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced 4% and 3% respectively.Caterpillar had fallen as much as 23% off its high since mid-January. The decline was blamed on President Trump's protectionist stance, which now has progressed to a trade war with China.Yet, Caterpillar was doing fine Monday afternoon. Some market watchers still regard Trump's moves as negotiating tactics rather than actions of conviction. If so, then stocks may be ready for a substantial relief rally.Earnings season, too, holds the potential to drive stock prices higher.

622,A,"An exchange-traded fund tracking Saudi Arabian shares has delivered the biggest return among peers so far this year as investors anticipate an upgrade of the Middle East's biggest economy to emerging markets status.The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (KSA) has returned 17% year-to-date, more than any other of the 229 ETFs focused on emerging-market equities tracked by Bloomberg. Its gain compares with an average loss of 6.6% for the group in the same period.Qualified foreign investors have been net buyers of Saudi shares in all but three weeks this year on anticipation that the country would earn emerging markets classification from major index compilers this year. FTSE Russell announced the upgrade in March with implementation starting next year, and MSCI followed suit last month.Total assets of the KSA fund have increased almost 20 times to $271 million since December. The fund has Saudi Basic Industries, Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank as its top holdings. All of these are expected to be added to emerging markets indexes compiled by FTSE and MSCI.Bets on the upgrades have helped the Tadawul All Share Index produce a 14% gain this year, one of the biggest advances among major bench marks globally. And as the interest in Saudi stocks grows, other investment firms are launching similar products. Franklin Templeton Investments is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for a Saudi Arabia ETF, while Invesco (IVZ) last month listed Europe's first fund tracking the country's shares.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular.

The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth.

That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

636,A,"Boeing (BA) showed off a hypersonic airliner concept capable of flying passengers across the Atlantic in just two hours.XThe concept jet was unveiled at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation 2018 conference in Atlanta. It is an early step in a long-term development plan that will have both commercial and military applications.""We're excited about the potential of hypersonic technology to connect the world faster than ever before,"" Kevin Bowcutt, senior technical fellow and chief scientist of hypersonics at Boeing, said in a news release. ""Boeing is building upon a foundation of six decades of work designing, developing and flying experimental hypersonic vehicles, which makes us the right company to lead the effort in bringing this technology to market in the future.""Boeing can boast an earlier hypersonic milestone: In 2015, its unmanned X-51 Waverider flew for more than six minutes and reached speeds of over Mach 5 for 210 seconds, marking the longest duration for a powered hypersonic flight.However, travelers will have to wait a while before taking to the skies in a hypersonic passenger jet. Bowcutt estimated such an aircraft will not take flight until 20 to 30 years in the future.There are numerous design challenges that make supersonic transportation difficult. These include excessive noise generation at takeoff due to sonic booms during flight, high development costs and expensive construction materials. The cost per seat is also much higher than subsonic airliners.Boeing shares rose10 cents at 331.30 on the stock market today. On Monday, ongoing U.S. trade tensions with China sent the stock as low as 327.60, triggering the 8% sell rule from a 365.10 cup-with-handle buy point on a weekly chart.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere have not been any passenger jets capable of traveling faster than the speed of sound since the Concorde was retired in 2003. The Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by France's Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation.The Concorde could fly at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, allowing it to travel from London to New York in three hours vs. about seven hours for a standard passenger jet.But at Mach 5, Boeing's concept jet would fly across the Atlantic in just two hours, though it's not clear if the plane would travel at Mach 5 for the whole duration of the flight. The jet would also be capable of crossing the Pacific in just three hours, while a typical nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take about 12 hours.In 2015, Airbus patented a hypersonic jet that it said would reach speeds as high as Mach 4.5. Dubbed the Concorde-2, it would be faster and quieter than the famed supersonic jet, and make a journey from New York to London in just one hour.Two turbo jets would allow the jet to climb vertically at takeoff, and would retract into the fuselage before it reaches the speed of sound. A rocket motor would then propel it even faster.Meanwhile, Boeing also said Tuesday that it has invested in parcel drone company Matternet.

637,A,"The bear market is back in China, but should that matter to U.S. investors? On Friday, the Shanghai Composite dropped to 20.9% off its Jan. 29 high. Traditionally a 20% decline is the definition of a bear market.IBD's Stock Spotlight screen offers a partial answer to the who-cares question. Going into Tuesday's session, only one China-based stock made the screen: Alibaba (BABA).Earlier this year, as the Shanghai peaked, as much as 25% of the Spotlight lineup was China-based stocks.Individual investors might argue that the 2015-16 bear market in China meant little to U.S. investors. From a peak in June 2015 to a low in January 2016, the Shanghai Composite lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, U.S. indexes dropped less than 10% in the same period.Still, a decline is nothing to cheer about, especially since circumstances today are different.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the 2015-16 China bear market, the chief bearish driver was slowing economic growth in China. Now President Trump's trade war is the chief catalyst.Let's take a look at the nine China-based stocks that have made the Spotlight screen at least once this year. What can their relative absence tell us now?No. 1: Online marketplace Alibaba is 10% off its high, not bad vs. the Shanghai's 20% drop. Yet the stock lost its 10-week moving average Monday. China is trying to shift to a more consumer-based economy and Alibaba could benefit from those efforts.No. 2: Tutoring center operator TAL Education (TAL) has made the Spotlight screen for more weeks this year than any other China stock. But after hitting a new high June 12, the stock has fallen 21% off its high. The last few bases were late-stage patterns.No. 3: Express delivery provider ZTO Express (ZTO) is 9% off its high. Action appears normal, even positive. The 2016 IPO recently found support at its 10-week line. The up-down volume ratio is a bullish 2.1, above the neutral 1.0 level.No. 4: Hotel chain Huazhu Group (HTHT) is 11% off its high after trimming gains from its May 15 breakout. The relative strength line, which measures a stock's price movement vs. the S&P 500, is bending south.No. 5: Solar-related stock Daqo New Energy (DQ) is 51% off its high. Both the 10-week and 40-week lines have been lost.No. 6: Social networking platform Weibo (WB) is 35% off its high. It hasn't made the Spotlight screen since March.No. 7: E-commerce solutions provider Baozun (BZUN) is finding support at its 10-week line. This is the first trip to the line since Baozun broke out in May.No. 8: Online marketplace 58.com (WUBA) lost its 10-week line this week. The stock is 19% off its high.No. 9: Health care services company iKang Healthcare Group (KANG) is 1% off its high. The company has agreed to a merger.What can investors learn from the Spotlight lineup?Many of the above China-based stocks carry seriously damaged charts.ZTO's chart is probably the most promising for two reasons. First, it's newest to the Spotlight lineup, having appeared in two of the past four weeks. Second, it is holding above its 10-week line.ZTO could be a watch list candidate. If the Shanghai Composite can find a bottom and rise, and the U.S. indexes can shake off their problems, ZTO could become a winner.RELATED:Trump Threatens Harley-DavidsonIs Stock Market About To Relive 1930?Stocks That Are Showing Relative Strength?MarketSmith: 3 Weeks For $19.95

In Q2, revenue in the snack segment grew 4%, while overall revenue growth was only 2%.Meanwhile, chip stocks of a different order did well. Chip designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) gapped up 3% in twice its usual volume. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) rose 1% as it tried to retake its 200-day line.Alphabet (GOOGL) tacked on small gains but was on track to extend its win streak to four up days in a row.Oil stocks showed some breakouts, but action was unsteady. For example, ConocoPhillips (COP), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Marathon Oil (MRO) each cleared a buy point and then reversed under the entry. After that, they seesawed above and below the entry.Light sweet crude climbed about 1% to $74.70 per barrel and then reversed to $73.79. Crude then recovered partially, rising to $74.16.The noise around the trade war has quieted in recent sessions. Some optimism has even emerged.

644,A,"Investors may be overlooking a big factor in who wins the takeover battle for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) — whether the Murdoch family wants to be the biggest shareholders in the new company, or would they rather cash out?The question is the proverbial elephant-in-the-room as a bidding war rages between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) for a chunk of Rupert Murdoch's Fox media empire. Fox on Wednesday accepted Disney's sweetened, $71 billion cash-and-stock bid, at $38-a-share. That countered Comcast's $65 billion all-cash bid. Experts expect Comcast to fire back soon.Murdoch, along with sons Lachlan and James — all three of them Fox board members — are legally bound recommend the best offer to shareholders. Whether Comcast or Disney prevails in the showdown over Fox likely boils down to the highest offer, tax issues and regulatory approval.But a lurking concern is whether Murdoch and family want to stay in the pantheon of the media and entertainment industry. Murdoch owns 17% of Fox's outstanding shares. The family stands to be the biggest shareholders in a combined Disney-Fox. It's possible a Murdoch one day could run Disney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Murdochs, however, become smaller media industry players if Fox ultimately accepts Comcast's all-cash bid.Comcast and Disney are fighting over Fox's film and TV studios, cable networks, international TV business and a 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky. Not everything in Fox goes, however. Fox retains its news channel, TV stations, sports networks and other assets and spin it into a new company, with Lachlan Murdoch as CEO.It's not clear if the Murdochs will get a Disney board seat if the Mouse prevails vs. Comcast, says Blair Levin, analyst at New Street Research. The reason: Disney owns a TV broadcaster, ABC, and the Murdochs still would have Fox.Craig Moffett, a longtime industry analyst, on Thursday published a report saying Disney holds an edge over Comcast. He says Disney's mostly stock offer provides tax advantages. He notes that Fox shareholders have a choice of taking cash or stock. And, Moffett says Disney may have a better chance of getting regulatory approval, despite AT&T's (T) recent court victory in the Time Warner acquisition.Asked about Murdoch winding up as the biggest shareholder in Disney as a factor, Moffett replied in an email: ""Yes, that too.""Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday the company has legally committed to not split Fox assets with Comcast. That raises the stakes for the Roberts family.Ralph Roberts co-founded Comcast in the 1960s. A dual-class stock structure gives the Roberts family control of about a third of the company's voting power.Comcast stock dropped 1.8% to close at 32.79 on the stock market today as Fox rose 0.5% to 48.34.

At a final 18-month analysis, the treatment slowed the progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with an early form of the disease.Most analysts say this lends credence to the theory that Alzheimer's is tied to the buildup of toxic plaque called beta-amyloid in the brain.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe results for BAN2401 ""could not only enable Biogen to have a second shot on goal, but also provide strong validation for the hypothesis underling the key Phase 3 candidate — and potential future growth driver — aducanumab,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.Analysts noted the study had a unique design allowing Biogen multiple interim analyses to look for early effectiveness or futility. The study also used a marker called Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score, as well as a measure of reduction of amyloid using a PET scan to determine effectiveness.Researchers found a statistically significant reduction in amyloid and slowing progression in those who received the highest dose. The worst-case scenario would have been a reduction in beta amyloid, but not a slowing of progression. This would have disproved the theory, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.BAN2401 had ""an acceptable tolerability profile."" The most common side effect was brain swelling known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect of Alzheimer's treatments. It appeared in less than 10% of most patients and below 15% of those at the highest dose.RBC's Abrahams noted the way the study was designed ""stacks the deck in favor of its own success.""Further, the measure for progression was first proposed by Eisai researchers. In most Alzheimer's treatment studies, including aducanumab, researchers look for improvement as measured by the scale known as Clinical Dementia Rating — Sum of Boxes.The news for BAN2401 was largely unexpected. In December, the Alzheimer's treatment failed to meet its key goals at an interim analysis. But the biotechnology giant said it would continue the test out to the 18-month mark based on the fact it didn't appear futile.Biogen is preparing to release the full details at a future medical conference. Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Biogen could take two tacts for BAN2401. It could seek approval based on the Phase 2 study, putting the drug on the market in late 2019. More likely, it will design a Phase 3 study.Meanwhile, analysts are scrambling to determine what the BAN2401 results mean for Biogen's key Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab. Both drugs work to remove beta amyloid, though they aim for different types of the plaque. Aducanumab is set to have Phase 3 data in late 2019 or early 2020.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges was the key detractor for Biogen and Eisai's results. Unlike other analysts, he doesn't see the BAN2401 study as proving the beta-amyloid thesis for Alzheimer's disease. Further, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't yet weighted in on Eisai's alternative measure of progression.""There is very little detail about other more validated cognitive measures in the joint press release and we find no reason to believe this either proves or disproves the amyloid hypothesis or has an impact on the likelihood that aducanumab will succeed in its ongoing Phase 3 trial,"" he said in his note to clients.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Why Hope Endures For An Alzheimer's Treatment — And Biogen Could Be FirstChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half Position

658,A,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines.

662,A,"China growth stocks withered and Wall Street felt more selling pressure Wednesday as concerns over potential tariffs imposed on goods between the U.S. and its trading partners weighed on stocks today. The Nasdaq composite led with 1.5% decline, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 0.9%.Volume rose on both exchanges, according to early data. That signaled strong propensity among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like to anxiously sell equities and raise cash.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) almost resisted the overall decline, edging less than 0.2% lower and outperforming the market. The relative strength has come at an important time. Earlier this week, the iPhone and iPad giant sold off hard and closed beneath its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months.At 184.16, the megacap tech remains mildly above a 179.04 entry in a narrow and shallow double-bottom base. Therefore, for now, this is one reason why the leading tech stock can still be held by those who bought at the most recent proper buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average performed relatively better, losing just 0.7%, while the small-cap S&P 600 slid 1.4%. Yet at 1018, the S&P 600's 8.9% advance since Jan. 1 still sharply outperforms a less than 1% gain for the S&P 500.Breadth was severely negative as losing stocks outmatched winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-1 ratio. On the NYSE, losers beat winners by a 5-2 margin.Meanwhile, crude oil jumped sharply. U.S. near-term futures gaining 2.6% to $72.38 a barrel.

The company's market value is nearly $85 billion.Plenty of other Chinese growth stocks got hammered.Autohome (ATHM), a former Leaderboard name, sharply undercut its 50-day moving average and issued a key defensive sell signal. Shares fell nearly 8% to 97.51 in volume that grew 169% above average.The 50-day moving average, painted as a red line in IBD's daily charts, had contained no fewer than five pullbacks by Autohome since early February.Therefore, Wednesday's big cut of the 50-day line showed a bearish change in character in the leading stock.The online marketing firm for the Chinese vehicle market had vaulted out of a double-bottom base at 66.55 on Jan. 2. It ultimately rallied 79% before sliding into its current price correction.Apple has not made much price progress compared with 2017, when it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6 of that year. That cup with handle was not only first stage, but also served as a bottoming-base chart pattern after the stock's lengthy decline. Shares have risen 64% since then.However, the stock has continued to trace a slow yet steady uptrend while finding buying support at the key 10- and 40-week moving averages.Plus, the fundamental picture still looks bright. Earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter are forecast to grow 31% to $2.18 a share.

This proprietary rating focuses on sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.A handful of companies staged breakouts, but their finishes lacked oomph.Kemet (KEM), part of the IBD 50, attempted a breakout from a long, deep cup with handle that showed a 25.79 buy point. Shares got as high as a 3.7% gain to 26.33 before cooling off and falling 15 cents to 25.23. Volume jumped 54% above usual levels.The drop within Kemet's cup base, a 49.8% slide from a 27.35 high to 13.73 at the bottom, is way more than the acceptable limit of 33% to 35% corrections in a normal cup with handle.However, keep in mind that the stock ramped up from as low as 1.26 in early 2016, a 2,070% gain until it carved the latest base. In some cases, a leading stock can build such a deep base, break out properly, and keep running to new highs.Outstanding fundamentals going forward usually factor into the story.Kemet, an expert in capacitors for electronics manufacturers, has grown its earnings per share 44%, 175%, 250%, 450%, 246%, 373% and 221% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.That kind of blistering growth is not likely to continue. But the Street sees earnings in the fiscal first-quarter ending in June rising a healthy 39% to 46 cents a share.Despite Wednesday's negative reversal, Kemet hasn't yet triggered the golden rule of investing.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, buy points, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningThe Stock Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Key Sell SignalThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerSector LeadersCan You Spot The Next Major Market Top?

665,A,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

That was due to an outdated Supreme Court decision on sales tax collection. Wayfair (W) operates five online retail sites that sell a variety of goods for the home.The 5-to-4 decision overturned a 1992 decision, Quill vs. North Dakota, that involved mail-order catalogs. That older case prevented states from collecting a sales tax from retailers without a physical presence in their state.

671,A,"China's mainland stock markets ended their first week fully in bear market territory on Friday, as Shanghai joined Shenzhen in pulling back more than 20% from February highs.Chart damage across the landscape of China-based stocks trading in the U.S. was significant. Leaders including Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and Autohome (ATHM) stabbed below support in heavy trade. Others, like Baidu (BIDU) and YY Inc. (YY), also broke support but in weak trade and therefore inflicting less damage on their charts.For several, including Baozun (BZUN), iQiyi (IQ) and CLPS (CLPS), the week's losses may have been a positive.China markets have fallen largely in response to the trade brawl underway as the U.S. attempts to restructure its international trade agreements. The tit-for-tat threat of sanctions between the two countries, and similar skirmishes underway between the U.S. and various other trading partners, has created the kind of volatile environment that is hostile to investor confidence.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseVarious types of institutional investors seek shelter in safe havens that can include the dollar, the Japanese yen, gold and Treasury bonds. That flight to safety helps drive currencies such as China's yuan lower. After a tough week, the yuan staged a modest rebound on Friday. But it was still set for its largest monthly decline on record, losing about 3.3% of its value vs. the dollar in June, according to Reuters.China Shenzhen Composite entered a bear market on June 19, as it fell more than 20% below its November high. The Shanghai Composite slipped into bear territory on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index pulled back to a Thursday low that was 15.8% below its January high.

U.S.-based stocks with China exposure also continue to suffer. Caterpillar (CAT) dropped more than 10% in June. Deere (DE) fell more than 5%.

Two of those are IPOs.IQiyi dropped almost 11% for the week, its second steep weekly decline. The divot looks severe. But the pullback marked its low at 34.6% below its June 19 high. That leaves it within the 35% boundary of what is usually considered to be a normal pullback for cup-type bases. The stock remained up 57% since clearing an IPO base in May. But it has yet to form a standard base.The chart for another IPO, Huya (HUYA), looked similar at the end of the week. The pullback from its high was 41%, however.

The stock has nearly doubled since clearing an IPO base in mid-June.Baozun pulled back more than 10% for the week, but managed to keep close to its 10-week moving average.

672,A,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

Annual wage growth came in at 2.7%, less than expected.The U.S led in ratcheting up tariffs early Friday across an increased range of goods imported from China. But four to six weeks of previous declines across global stock, commodities and currency markets had largely priced in the impact of the China tariffs, launched by the U.S. at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The tariffs aim to twist China's arm as the U.S. attempts to restructure its trade relationship with the country.  President Donald Trump told reporters late Thursday that the U.S. would begin with tariffs on $34 billion in China-made goods imported to the U.S. tariffs on another $16 billion in goods were set to launch in two weeks, he said, with potential for as much as $500 billion more.

"
675,A,"A stock that rises 20% to 25% from its buy point presents a choice. Do you hold or take the profit? Several factors can legitimately influence that decision.One: If the stock's 20% gain comes in the first two or three weeks after the breakout, then the stock should be held at least eight weeks — barring outright sell signals. The great stocks often get a fast start. You don't want to sell such a stock too early.Two: If the stock took longer to reach the 20% mark but has three quarters of EPS acceleration in a row, you might want to hold the stock.Three: If the 20% gain came slowly and from a second-stage base or later, you should sell. Most stocks correct after a 20% to 25% gain. A third-stage base is prone to fail. So, why hold for that?Four: If the gain came in an erratic fashion, sell. It doesn't matter if the stock or the general market is to blame. Such a stock is likely to move against you quickly.Five: If you've taken a 7% or 8% loss recently, then the bias tilts toward taking the profit in the 20% to 25% gainer. It's prudent to keep a 3-1 ratio between gains and losses. You can be right just once every four tries and still break even or make a small gain.Six: If you've taken several 7% to 8% losses and have no stock up 20% to 25%, consider taking smaller profits to erase the losses. Then you should step back and study your buys and sells to determine the reason you are losing.If the market is the problem, you need to raise cash and stay out of the market. If you're the problem, you need to adjust your approach to avoid losing more money.If several stocks you sold put a 10% dent in your portfolio, that's OK if winners have boosted your portfolio 30%. You must, however, take the profits at some point. Paper gains are imaginary until a sell makes them come true.SodaStream International (SODA) cleared a 43.10 buy point in the handle of a long bottoming-style cup base on Dec. 17, 2012.

Annual wage growth came in at 2.7%, less than expected.The U.S led in ratcheting up tariffs early Friday across an increased range of goods imported from China. But four to six weeks of previous declines across global stock, commodities and currency markets had largely priced in the impact of the China tariffs, launched by the U.S. at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The tariffs aim to twist China's arm as the U.S. attempts to restructure its trade relationship with the country.  President Donald Trump told reporters late Thursday that the U.S. would begin with tariffs on $34 billion in China-made goods imported to the U.S. tariffs on another $16 billion in goods were set to launch in two weeks, he said, with potential for as much as $500 billion more.

The move sent Biogen well above resistance at its 40-week moving average, and up the right side of a five-month-long cup-base pattern.Michigan-based Visteon seized an early 3.4% gain. Standard & Poor's announced late Thursday it would add the maker of auto interior components to the S&P Midcap 400 beginning July 11.

678,A,"In the REIT sector, institutions favor companies that can post solid and steady profits. In the case of Starwood Property Trust (STWD), profits are not only stable — they're growing nicely. Plus the yield of this giant in the world of commercial mortgage REITs beats the S&P 500 by about as much as the Triple Crown-winning thoroughbred Justify did against other horses in the Belmont Stakes.On May 4, the investor and originator in commercial property loans reported its biggest profit increase in nearly four years. Core earnings of 58 cents per share grew 14% in the first quarter of this year. That follows increases of 2%, 4%, 10% and 10% in the prior four quarters. The three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale of zero (very stable) to 99 (very wild) benefits long-term shareholders.Revenue growth is also accelerating. The top line rose 31% to $260.6 million in the March period, nearly matching the 32% jump in Q4 of last year.The quarter's results included the closing of $405 million of a previously announced purchase of a $595 million portfolio of affordable housing loans. Starwood issued $500 million of 3.625% in unsecured notes while retiring $370 million of convertible senior debt holding a coupon of 4.55%.Starwood also deployed $2 billion worth of capital and has put $1.8 billion to work in its lending segment.""Our advantaged access to best-in-class low-cost funding options, including our most recent $500 million unsecured debt offering, has enabled us to source and close attractive risk-adjusted lending investments in a very competitive market,"" Barry Sternlicht, chairman and CEO, said in a news release.The Greenwich, Conn., firm declared a cash payout of 48 cents a share for the second quarter.

679,A,"U.S. manufacturing expanded more than forecast last month as a gauge of supplier-delivery times shot up amid robust orders and production, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed on Monday.The factory index climbed 1.5 points to 60.2, matching the second-highest since 2004 and beating estimates for a dip to 58.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.The supplier deliveries gauge jumped 6.2 points to 68.2, the second- highest since April 1979. The subindex shows lead times increasing as producers have trouble meeting demand.The new orders index dipped 0.2 point to a still-robust 63.5. The production gauge rose to 62.3 from 61.5.While indexes of orders, production and factory employment remained elevated, the ISM's main gauge of June factory activity was inflated by a surge in the group's measure of supplier deliveries, indicating lengthening lead times.The delays potentially reflect purchasing managers' efforts to acquire materials ahead of President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on Chinese products, which would follow levies on steel and aluminum from around the world. Such demand, coming on top of steady consumption and business investment, is testing capacity limits of both manufacturers and the transportation sector.""Lead-time extensions, steel and aluminum disruptions, supplier labor issues, and transportation difficulties continue,"" Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM Business Survey Committee, said in a statement. ""Demand remains robust, but the nation's employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle. Respondents are overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff related activity is and will continue to affect their business.""Supply-chain disruptions are also helping to push up input prices. The ISM's latest measure of costs of raw and other materials used in manufacturing fell in June but remained close to a seven-year high.Employment gauge was little changed at 56 after 56.3.

680,A,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

681,A,"Autohome (ATHM) is the IBD Stock of the Day and provides a lesson on how a double-digit gain can vanish quickly.Autohome on Monday flashed a sell signal as the stock went on an unwanted round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout. It's also a reason to pay close attention to your portfolio during a rough day on the stock market.Chinese stocks like Autohome, Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and others were getting hammered Monday amid continuing trade-war threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump increased his threats over the weekend, planning to stop Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology companies.Autohome is a leading online market for automobile consumers.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAutohome stock is benefiting from burgeoning sales of automobiles online and the growth of China's urban middle class for whom the car is a status symbol.The stock hit a buy point of 107.64 on May 30, a day before the company was added to the closely watched MSCI indexes of China stocks. Company shares jumped 6.3% that day to close at 109.07. The stock broke above the 107.64 buy point from an ascending base, considered a rare but bullish chart pattern that can lead to powerful gains.The IBD Stock Of The Day column can help you understand, for example, the right time to buy a stock, and the optimal time to sell. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, the ascending base. However, both Autohome and Atlassian (TEAM) provide the lesson that in a weakening market, an investor should always prepare an exit plan even after a leading stock produces this key chart pattern.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.Autohome stock came public in December 2013, soaring more than 75% on its first day of trading. The Autohome initial public offering IPO raised $133 million, pricing shares at 17. The online automotive advertising market in China has achieved rapid growth as a result of the development of China's automotive and Internet industries. China is the largest market for car sales globally, but only an estimated 54 out of 1,000 Chinese own cars.Autohome makes money mainly from advertising. It also has growing sales in auto finance and data products.But where there is market opportunity, there is also competition. Autohome competitors include BitAuto (BITA), a provider of online data and services for China's automotive industry.More competition is emerging from China-based Uxin. The company offers one of the largest used-car e-commerce platforms in China, in terms of both the number of transactions facilitated and total GMV in 2017. Uxin is scheduled to commence an initial public offering, pricing shares Tuesday and trading Wednesday. It aims to raise $437 million by offering 38 million American depositary shares at a price range of 10.50 to 12.50. That gives it a fully diluted market value near $3.5 billion.

Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) also plunged.Macau, which is China's only legal casino hub, saw revenue grow by 12.5% in June. According to official data, revenue jumped to 22.49 billion patacas ($2.78 billion) in June, below expected growth of 17%-21%.Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen said business volume across Macau decelerated notably in the last week of June.""We're surveying the market to see if there was a universal root cause, but at this point we're not concerned,"" he said in a research note.

685,A,"When you drink a cup of coffee, you can avoid getting burned badly by taking sips instead of just gulping it down.It's much the same in investing. If you find a stock with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, don't jump in all at once. Start by using a portion of your allotted capital for the trade and build up into a full position as the stock rises.This process of pyramiding a position is a way to enter a trade and at the same time reduce risk. Investors can use all of their allocated capital and buy their entire position at one time. But just be aware that while you can make more money this way, you can also quickly lose more money by going all-in.For example, if you use $10,000 to buy 200 shares of a $50 stock, all of your initial investment is at risk. If the stock falls 8% and you adhere to the golden rule of investing, you'd lose $800. If you started with half of a $10,000 position, or $5,000, you'd lose less if you were forced to cut losses at 8%.Pyramiding involves making multiple purchases to build your position. You can divide your purchases into three installments.For your first buy, use half of your maximum capital that you would allocate for a single stock investment. So if you have $10,000 to invest, use $5,000 for your initial position. Start things off right by buying a leader once it goes through the buy point of a proper base in volume that's at least 40% above average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnly buy more shares if the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price. If it does, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy. Now you're 80% invested.If the stock goes up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final buy. Now you're fully invested and the stock is acting right.Pyramiding is smarter, as you're only putting more money to work after a stock has proven that it can go higher. What you are essentially doing is averaging up, the opposite of average down. The latter is often a losing proposition.On Oct. 12, 2010, more than a year after the March 2009 market bottom, Starbucks (SBUX) bolted past a 26.67 entry from a cup-with-handle base in about twice its average trade (1). An initial position that made up 50% of your designated full stake could havebeen put on there.A second buy could also have been established Oct. 12 — the same day as the breakout — or in the next few trading sessions as shares rose more than 2% past the 26.67 trigger.A final buy in Starbucks could have been made as early as Oct. 14 as it rallied 4% past the initial 26.67 buy point (2), near 27.74.The stock rose 25% by early January 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.Let's examine a more recent example in Shake Shack (SHAK). The fellow retail restaurant group member sprinted up to a peak of 96.75 in just 16 weeks after its NYSE debut in January 2015 at 21 a share. The stock then melted into a long, deep correction lasting years.But 2018 is a different story.The premium hamburger and shake chain broke out of an excellent 17-week cup with handle on April 26. The stock rallied 2.15, or 5%, to 45.40. Volume edged 13% above its 50-day average. The buy point was 44.50, a dime above the highest price within the handle.Let's say you wanted to invest $50,000 in Shake Shack. You could buy roughly $25,000 worth, or 560 shares, as soon as they hit a price of 44.50. Once the stock rallied 2.5% above the 44.50 correct buy point, or 45.61, then you could add another 330 shares.The time to do that? The next day, April 27.Shake Shack bolted 1.85 points, or 4.1%, and got as high as 47.50 intraday. That marked a new 52-week peak. Volume improved to a 69% jump vs. usual levels.Your total stake now: 890 shares, $39,971.30 deployed, average cost of $44.91 a share.The session on April 27 proved so strong that you could have completed the full position with the third buy of 215 shares at 46.73 apiece ($10,046.95).Three layers of goodness. Just five sessions later, Shake Shack rocketed up 18% and hit new multiyear highs following strong Q1 results (earnings up 50% on an adjusted basis, sales up 29% to a quarterly record of $99.1 million).Today, shares are trading around 64, up a beefy 41% from your average cost of $45.27 a share in the full position.(Editor's Note: A version of this article originally ran in the Jan. 24, 2012, edition of IBD.

690,A,"It's the age-old story of the retail business: When one door closes, another opens.For years, experts have predicted a so-called retail apocalypse as well-known chains like Sports Authority and Payless ShoeSource went bankrupt. The most recent high-profile victim was Toys R Us, which liquidated in the middle of March after a failed rescue attempt.But a funny thing happened on the way to Armageddon. In the wake of the toy giant's collapse, a corner of the industry known as specialty retailing — where stores focus on smaller, niche categories — has been on a roll. And for investors looking to capitalize, that's meant a shift from large-capitalization stocks to midcaps, where many specialty retailers reside.Since March 15, the day Toys R Us announced it was going out of business, the S&P 500 Specialty Retail Index has more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 Internet and Catalog Retail index. The move is earnings driven, as over that time almost all of the companies in the S&P 500 Retailing Index have reported their quarterly results, with about 70% beating forecasts, according to Bloomberg data.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""A lot of the retailers had very good same-store sales, and what that shows is the traffic is still there for people, and now it's a matter of how do you convert traffic to buyers?"" Joe ""JJ"" Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. ""Retailers themselves have gotten much more creative and much better at helping their clients.""Stellar earnings from companies such as luxury purveyor Tiffany (TIF) have powered the specialty retail index higher. Tiffany reported strong sales growth in the quarter ended April 30, raised its profit forecast and announced a share buyback plan of $1 billion. That's helped propel Tiffany shares to a gain of about 26% this year.One way for investors to play this growth without fully diving into retail is to buy a midcap index fund.For example, two-thirds of the companies in the specialty retail index appear in the $23 billion Vanguard Mid-Cap (VO) fund, which is the second-largest exchange traded fund focusing on midcap companies. It tracks the CRSP US Mid Cap Index, which targets companies that fall between the top 70% to 85% of investable market capitalization, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices website.Retail makes up 6% of VO, the fund's fourth-largest industry holding. The largest midcap ETF, iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), has 5.2% of its holdings in the retail space. The $47 billion fund only allocates more cash to real estate and banking.There are 48 U.S.-centric ETFs that focus specifically on midcap stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, compared with nearly 100 products that focus on small caps. Looking at the three largest midcap ETFs, retail makes up more than 5% of each, putting it among the five largest industry allocations.The strength of midcap retailers is hardly an anomaly — the entire industry is doing well. The S&P 500 Retailing Index is the best performing group this year, up nearly 22%. And there could be more room to run.Some retail stocks are cheap compared with historical valuations. The S&P Retail Select Industry's price-earnings ratio has fallen to 14 after peaking near 35 in 2014, putting the index 36% below its five-year average of 22.Still, the market isn't exactly buying the idea that specialty retailers can continue to beat their internet rivals — at least if fund flows are any guide.Investors poured about $42 million into the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) in May, making it the best month in the fund's history. The two-year-old ETF holds companies that make at least 70% of their revenue online. Meanwhile, VO lost around $5 million in assets this month, and the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks the broader retail industry, has seen $15 million in outflows.""You definitely get some of the more hated retail names,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said of midcap ETFs. ""But keep in mind (that) if there's a real move to value, some of those could do well.""That's already starting to happen, as seen in the strength of specialty stores. It's no longer just the internet retailing moguls like Amazon.com (AMZN) that are leading the pack higher.""The retail sector is breaking out on both an absolute and relative basis to the broader consumer discretionary sector, and internet vendors can no longer take all the credit as the source for the industry's recent strength,"" Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a recent report.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:4 Top Ways To Profit From Twitter's Big Stock MoveAre Small-Cap Growth Stocks The New Market Leaders?New ETF Aims To Provide A Steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

692,A,"China growth stocks withered and Wall Street felt more selling pressure Wednesday as concerns over potential tariffs imposed on goods between the U.S. and its trading partners weighed on stocks today. The Nasdaq composite led with 1.5% decline, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 0.9%.Volume rose on both exchanges, according to early data. That signaled strong propensity among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like to anxiously sell equities and raise cash.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) almost resisted the overall decline, edging less than 0.2% lower and outperforming the market. The relative strength has come at an important time. Earlier this week, the iPhone and iPad giant sold off hard and closed beneath its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months.At 184.16, the megacap tech remains mildly above a 179.04 entry in a narrow and shallow double-bottom base. Therefore, for now, this is one reason why the leading tech stock can still be held by those who bought at the most recent proper buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average performed relatively better, losing just 0.7%, while the small-cap S&P 600 slid 1.4%. Yet at 1018, the S&P 600's 8.9% advance since Jan. 1 still sharply outperforms a less than 1% gain for the S&P 500.Breadth was severely negative as losing stocks outmatched winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-1 ratio.

The company's market value is nearly $85 billion.Plenty of other Chinese growth stocks got hammered.Autohome (ATHM), a former Leaderboard name, sharply undercut its 50-day moving average and issued a key defensive sell signal. Shares fell nearly 8% to 97.51 in volume that grew 169% above average.The 50-day moving average, painted as a red line in IBD's daily charts, had contained no fewer than five pullbacks by Autohome since early February.Therefore, Wednesday's big cut of the 50-day line showed a bearish change in character in the leading stock.The online marketing firm for the Chinese vehicle market had vaulted out of a double-bottom base at 66.55 on Jan. 2. It ultimately rallied 79% before sliding into its current price correction.Apple has not made much price progress compared with 2017, when it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6 of that year. That cup with handle was not only first stage, but also served as a bottoming-base chart pattern after the stock's lengthy decline. Shares have risen 64% since then.However, the stock has continued to trace a slow yet steady uptrend while finding buying support at the key 10- and 40-week moving averages.Plus, the fundamental picture still looks bright. Earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter are forecast to grow 31% to $2.18 a share.

Shares got as high as a 3.7% gain to 26.33 before cooling off and falling 15 cents to 25.23. Volume jumped 54% above usual levels.The drop within Kemet's cup base, a 49.8% slide from a 27.35 high to 13.73 at the bottom, is way more than the acceptable limit of 33% to 35% corrections in a normal cup with handle.However, keep in mind that the stock ramped up from as low as 1.26 in early 2016, a 2,070% gain until it carved the latest base. In some cases, a leading stock can build such a deep base, break out properly, and keep running to new highs.Outstanding fundamentals going forward usually factor into the story.Kemet, an expert in capacitors for electronics manufacturers, has grown its earnings per share 44%, 175%, 250%, 450%, 246%, 373% and 221% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.That kind of blistering growth is not likely to continue. But the Street sees earnings in the fiscal first-quarter ending in June rising a healthy 39% to 46 cents a share.Despite Wednesday's negative reversal, Kemet hasn't yet triggered the golden rule of investing.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, buy points, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningThe Stock Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Key Sell SignalThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerSector LeadersCan You Spot The Next Major Market Top?

695,A,"In the stock market, a great company is like a high-performance Porsche, and volume is the stock's fuel. You can blather all day about the company's potential, its fabulous new product, its incredible CEO. But if the company's stock, after making a great run, begins to hit new highs in low volume, it will likely cease to act like a high-performance roadster.In fact, the stock may be beginning to put on the brakes on its spectacular run.When new highs keep occurring in low volume, it's prime time to be watching for serious sell signals.IBD has shared dozens of proven sell rules to help you keep most of your hard-earned investment gains in individual stock market winners and leadership-quality ETFs on Wall Street. After a stock sees a volume dry-up at the peak, be ready to sell at least some shares when a stock drops very hard through the 50-day moving average in gigantic volume. Or the stock may shatter a long-term trend line.Did the stock have a pair of 2-for-1 stock splits recently? Or did the stock get socked really hard after breaking out of a badly formed late-stage base? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, it's time to get your defensive game on.Please go to a daily chart at IBD and look at the bottom part of each chart. Each thin vertically-aligned bar represents how many shares a stock traded each session. It's easy to tell on any given day whether trading increased vs. the prior day, decreased, or stayed virtually the same.Now look at those volume bars again. See the 50-day average volume line, drawn in red, draped across the high end of those volume bars? The level of that line shows how many shares exchanged hands each day over the 50 most recent trading days. It's called a ""moving average"" because after a session on Wall Street is over, a new daily volume figure has been born. Thus, a new average over the past 50 days is created; the average keeps moving.The 50-day moving average makes it easy to spot trends in turnover. The same goes for the 10-week moving average, which shows typical weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks, on a weekly chart.A stock's volume often tracks above its 50-day average when a stock's price climbs to new high ground. This is where this stock has never been before. There is no overhead resistance, and buyers should be luring offers with their increasing bids.If this doesn't drum up increased volume, you have a problem. Remember, too, that the uptrending stock already has had institutional support behind it. That's how it got to be an uptrending stock.What do you think would happen if the big-money funds stopped buying? The stock would fall under its own weight.And if you see that stock consistently making new highs without solid volume, that's a sign that the tide may be turning. That is, sellers may have more influence over the stock's future prices than the buyers.CME Group (CME) shows how volume served as a gauge for the stock's health.The operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures and options market built a cup from August 2003 to January 2004. The base showed just a few weeks of high-volume selling during the stock's descent, and more weeks of high-volume buying on the right side of its base.CME ran up five weeks in a row in mostly heavy volume (1). That great price-and-volume action not only put the finishing touches on the base, but it also sparked a fine breakout. Even after the stock got extended from a 79.40 buy point, the gains in high volume continued. In the week ended Feb. 27, 2004, CME shot up 9.7% to new highs in volume that jumped 67% above the weekly average (2).Now look at CME's two-week-long dip near its 10-week moving average in late March (3). The declines were mild, and volume in one of those two weeks dried up. Volume then really picked up in the ensuing four weeks as CME lurched into new highs (4).A cup with handle formed from July to September 2004. The breakout in the week ended Sept. 24 shows another volume surge (5).Now compare all this positive price-volume action with CME's behavior in December. CME hit new highs, but volume settled into an eerie quietness (6). You could have taken that as a serious warning from a well-behaving stock.At the time, its IBD ratings were fantastic: a 99 EPS, a 97 Relative Price Strength. But this Porsche, which had taken you so far for years, had run out of gas.The stock peaked at 230.25 in early January 2005, dropped hard through the 10-week moving average, triggering a defense-type sell signal. CME fell 29% in three months, setting the stage for a new base to form.CME broke out of a large double-bottom base with a 220.59 buy point during the week ended June 3, 2005, and posted an amazing run. It rallied 214% by October 2007. A new base formed, a five-week flat base. CME broke out past the correct entry point of 693.10 in early December that year.The rally lasted all of three weeks. CME made a closing high of 710.75 in the week ended Dec. 21, 2007. But volume really dried up. On a weekly basis, 2.3 million shares exchanged hands, 23% below the 10-week average.Over the next four weeks through January of 2008, CME dropped more than 24% off its peak of 714. By the end of 2008, the futures and options exchange traded at 208, 71% below its all-time high.(A version of this column first appeared in the Jan. 10, 2011, edition of IBD.

Eventually, the slice of U.S. imports hit with EU tariffs could more than double.Yet at the same time, German automakers are moving to head off an expanded Trump trade war threat of a 25% tariff on U.S. imports of European cars.

Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR), Okta (OKTA), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Five Below (FIVE) are all stocks holding up, close to setting up.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite only gave up a portion of their recent gains. Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been moving sideways since late January, with Trump trade war tensions a major factor. The Nasdaq composite hit new highs recently. But the Nasdaq has outperformed thanks to FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as well as software stocks, all relatively resistant to trade woes.Dow futures rose 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.4% above fair value. China's Shanghai composite rallied 2.2% Thursday, as most Asian markets rebounded.

Shares did tumble Monday on a report that Twitter has suspended a huge number of fake or suspicious accounts, but the social network said those won't affect active-user figures. Shares closed Wednesday at 43.86.Twitter stock is in the fourth week of a flat base, so it would need to consolidate through next week before it forms a proper buy point.The 2017 cybersecurity IPO cleared a shallow cup base convincingly in early May, then vaulted to an intraday peak of 61 on June 7. That record high came a day after reporting quarterly earnings. But Okta stock reversed that day to close down 6% at 49.12.

715,A,"Nearly two-thirds of the public oppose ""sanctuary cities."" Less than a third say they back the policy, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll.The IBD/TIPP poll asked about support for a policy in which ""some cities in the U.S. do not report illegal immigrants who commit crimes to federal immigration authorities.""It found that 64% oppose the policy, with just 31% supporting it.More interesting, while just 16% strongly support sanctuary cities, 45% strongly oppose the policy.Every one of the 41 demographic groups broken out by the IBD/TIPP poll opposes this policy, except for Democrats (only 44% oppose) it, liberals (38% oppose) and those between 18 and 24 (48% of whom oppose this policy).The strongest opposition comes from investors (71%), married women (70%), conservatives (79%), Gen-Xers (74%) and young boomers (72%).Even Hispanics oppose this policy by a 57% to 39% margin.The sanctuary cities controversy erupted after President Trump started to more strictly enforce existing immigration laws. Cities across the country passed ordinances announcing that, to one degree or another, they wouldn't cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, even when it involved illegal immigrants who had committed crimes.According to the Center for Immigration Studies, more than 150 cities and counties have declared themselves sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThen last October, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill making California a sanctuary state. The law, which went into effect at the start of this year, bans state and local law enforcement from holding illegal aliens on the basis of federal immigration detainers, and bans law enforcement from asking anyone about their immigration status. It also in many cases prohibits them from sharing information with ICE — including the release of inmates from a county jail — that isn't available to the general public.That prompted the Justice Dept. to sue the state in March, claiming the state law obstructed enforcement of federal immigration laws. More than a dozen cities and counties in California have either joined the Justice suit or are passing ordinances exempting them from the state ""sanctuary"" law.The Trump administration has attempted to withhold federal law enforcement grants from ""sanctuary cities,"" but a federal judge on Wednesday ruled in favor of the city of Philadelphia. The judge said that withholding certain law enforcement grants based on local immigration policies ""violates statutory and constitutional law."" The judge added that the city's policy of not complying fully with federal immigration authorities was ""reasonable, rational"" and ""equitable.""Previous IBD/TIPP polls have found public support for other Trump administration positions on immigration.The February poll found that 50% approve of ""the construction of physical and electronic barriers along the southern U.S. border."" Among independents, support is 65%.It also found that 55% back limits on chain migration.The IBD/TIPP poll in March 2017 found that 57% supported Trump's plan to hire 10,000 more immigration agents and 58% support the deportation of illegal immigrants charged with a crime, even if they haven't been convicted.Other polls have shown strong public support for several Trump immigration policies.Methodology: The June IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted May 29-June 5. It includes responses from 905 people nationwide, who were asked questions by live interviewers on phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.3 percentage points.

718,A,"Is Trumponomics having a second honeymoon? The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged to the 2nd-highest level since 2004 as the jobless rate matched a nearly 50-year low, the Nasdaq briefly scaled new heights and President Donald Trump pushed contentious immigration and trade policies.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 2.5 points to 56.4 in July, just off February's 13-year high of 56.7. Readings above the neutral 50 level reflect optimism.It's hard to ignore the role of Trumponomics. In fact, Americans' view of federal government economic policies, almost always negative since the financial crisis, vaulted into solidly optimistic territory for the first time since late 2006. Midwesterners haven't felt so good about federal policies since early 2002, and rural voters even longer than that.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes. They track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances, and views of how well government economic policies are working. All three rose in July, but the federal policies index led the surge.The six-month economic outlook gauge climbed 2.2 points to 53.4. That's a solid reading but still well below February's 57.5, two months after President Trump signed the tax cuts into law.The six-month personal financial outlook index gained seven-tenths of a point to 62.8, still below January's 14-year high of 64.Meanwhile, the measure of confidence in federal economic policies jumped 4.6 points to 52.9. The gauge hit 58.9 in the Midwest and 54.1 in the South. It remained in slightly pessimistic territory in the more-liberal West and Northeast. In rural areas, the federal policy gauge soared to 63.5 vs. 53.0 in suburban areas and 41.6 in urban areas.Despite a volatile stock market, the S&P 500 index rose in June, its fourth straight monthly gain.

720,A,"The Nasdaq composite led the upside in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and wiping away the prior day's 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good. It means that a strong shakeout of weak holders has occurred.The Nasdaq got as high as 7794, good for a new all-time high. The tech-rich composite has now extended its year-to-date gain to 12.9%.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on the strength of RV maker, drugstore chain, computer networking, movie, department store and medical software companies.

Shares are now up nearly 8%.Homebuilder, coal, diversified operations, fertilizer and soap stocks, however, fell 0.6% or more and weighed on the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost nearly 1.2% on Tuesday, traded virtually flat. The popular 30-stock average is trying to cling to its key 50-day moving average.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is replacing General Electric (GE) in the Dow Jones industrials, is nowhere near a potential breakout to new highs. The stock jumped more than 5% to 67.74 in heavy trade but is more than 19% below 52-week highs.

721,A,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite current supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

The Arlington, Va.-based utility with an international customer base was up as much as 22% this year before a recent drop trimmed the stock's gain to 17%.The stock's relative strength rating is 79, which means AES is outperforming almost eight of every 10 stocks in IBD's database.A midcap, AES pays an annualized dividend of 52 cents a share, which is 43% of its estimated earnings for 2018. The payout is only 16% of cash flow per share.According to IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co., the dividend growth rate is a stunning 32%.Part of the reason for the fast growth in the dividend is that the company only began paying dividends in late 2012.Going into Wednesday's session, the annualized yield was 4%.After two years of declining earnings, AES increased earnings 14% in 2017. The Street expects earnings to grow earnings 11% and 9% in 2018-19.CEO Andres Gluski at the May 8 earnings call noted that the company is undergoing a transformation.Recent steps include selling the company's Philippine assets for $1 billion and using most of the money to pay down debt.

727,A,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good.

Through Tuesday, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLF, had seen eight straight days of outflows, the longest streak in two years. Together, that amounted to nearly $1.8 billion in withdrawals from the fund, about 6% of its total market cap.In addition to a flattening yield curve casting a shadow over bank profits, the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests loom ahead of Thursday results. That's when the Federal Reserve approves or rejects banks' plans to return money to shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. All 35 banks tested passed the first round of tests last week, but not every one cleared the bar by a comfortable margin.""The Fed stress tests are proving to be a 'sell the news' event as the yield curve collapses,"" said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading Institutional Services.What's more, U.S. consumer confidence fell in June, a signal that could affect the path of interest rate hikes this year and beyond. Although the Fed is largely expected to raise rates at their meeting in September, the probability for a rate hike at that time has come down from 81% on Thursday to 78.8%.""Fed officials are narrowly split on the need to raise rates three or four times this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""Diminished confidence readings on the consumer may be all it takes for one Fed official to change their vote. This decision to hike rates in September isn't a done deal yet.""The pain has been felt even more drastically overseas, particularly in Europe where weaker economic data has proved concerning. The STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index has almost fallen into bear market territory, down more than 18% since its January highs. That compares to XLF, which has fallen 13% from its highs.To Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak, the weakness portrayed by the European banks is a warning signal that isn't receiving the attention it deserves.""The action in this group compared to the U.S. banking group reminds us of what took place in late 2016 and the first half of 2017. They both rallied together for a while, but then the European stocks accelerated higher and then the U.S. banks followed them higher,"" he wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""This time, they both sold off in the first quarter and now the European stocks are accelerating lower.

735,A,"Apple's (AAPL) services business, a growth engine in recent quarters, is likely to encounter diminished returns soon, a skeptical Wall Street analyst said Thursday.One of the most significant drivers of the company's services revenue has been AppleCare warranty programs. But that segment has grown largely because of price increases, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said in a report. Caso rates Apple stock as market perform, or hold.Another main services driver, the App Store, ""is likely to suffer from a law-of-large-numbers problem,"" Caso said. As the installed base of iPhones matures, growth will be harder to come by, he said.The company's services growth has been impressive, but is still tied to hardware sales, which are slowing, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Net, we find it difficult to argue services will be able to replace hardware sales as a growth driver"" for Apple, Caso said.In the March quarter, services revenue increased 31% year over year to $9.19 billion. The company's total sales rose 16% to $61.14 billion in its fiscal second quarter.""Services growth was the element that has allowed Apple to beat numbers despite maturing iPhone sales, and has become the biggest element of the bull case"" for the stock, he said.The company has set a goal of reaching about $48 billion in services revenue by fiscal 2020. Caso believes that goal is ""reasonably attainable"" because it assumes a moderation in services growth to the low double-digit range.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company doesn't break out the components of its services business. Caso believes it gets about 30% of its services revenue from AppleCare and about 35% from the App Store.Caso estimates AppleCare accounted for about a third of incremental services revenue growth over the past two years, while the App Store contributed about 40% of revenue growth in the same period.Other services include Apple Pay, Apple Music and iCloud.If the company wants to maintain the current pace of its services growth, it will need new services, Caso said. Advertising and a Netflix (NFLX)-like streaming video service are possible growth drivers, he said.Shares of the iPhone maker rose a fraction to close at 190.80 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple iPhone Production Pullback Hits Chip Suppliers

737,A,"Autohome (ATHM) is the IBD Stock of the Day and provides a lesson on how a double-digit gain can vanish quickly.Autohome on Monday flashed a sell signal as the stock went on an unwanted round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout. It's also a reason to pay close attention to your portfolio during a rough day on the stock market.Chinese stocks like Autohome, Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and others were getting hammered Monday amid continuing trade-war threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump increased his threats over the weekend, planning to stop Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology companies.Autohome is a leading online market for automobile consumers. Its cloud platform for used-car sellers now covers more than 35,000 dealers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAutohome stock is benefiting from burgeoning sales of automobiles online and the growth of China's urban middle class for whom the car is a status symbol.The stock hit a buy point of 107.64 on May 30, a day before the company was added to the closely watched MSCI indexes of China stocks. Company shares jumped 6.3% that day to close at 109.07. The stock broke above the 107.64 buy point from an ascending base, considered a rare but bullish chart pattern that can lead to powerful gains.The IBD Stock Of The Day column can help you understand, for example, the right time to buy a stock, and the optimal time to sell. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, the ascending base. However, both Autohome and Atlassian (TEAM) provide the lesson that in a weakening market, an investor should always prepare an exit plan even after a leading stock produces this key chart pattern.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.Autohome stock came public in December 2013, soaring more than 75% on its first day of trading. The Autohome initial public offering IPO raised $133 million, pricing shares at 17. The online automotive advertising market in China has achieved rapid growth as a result of the development of China's automotive and Internet industries. China is the largest market for car sales globally, but only an estimated 54 out of 1,000 Chinese own cars.Autohome makes money mainly from advertising. It also has growing sales in auto finance and data products.But where there is market opportunity, there is also competition. Autohome competitors include BitAuto (BITA), a provider of online data and services for China's automotive industry.More competition is emerging from China-based Uxin. The company offers one of the largest used-car e-commerce platforms in China, in terms of both the number of transactions facilitated and total GMV in 2017. Uxin is scheduled to commence an initial public offering, pricing shares Tuesday and trading Wednesday. It aims to raise $437 million by offering 38 million American depositary shares at a price range of 10.50 to 12.50. That gives it a fully diluted market value near $3.5 billion. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker UXIN.Autohome was on the exclusive list of IBD Leaderboard stocks. It was taken off the list Monday, along with Alibaba.Autohome stock flashed a sell signal Monday, erasing a double-digit gain from the 107.64 buy point. Autohome stock plunged 5.6%. closing at 108.03 on the stock market today.Alibaba, meanwhile, gave up the 200 level with conviction early Monday. Alibaba shares were down 5.7% to 190.54.Autohome reported first-quarter results on May 8 that topped analyst estimates as it guided second-quarter estimates higher. Revenue rose 5% from the year-ago period to $205.35 million.It earned an adjusted 70 cents a share, topping estimates for 60 cents and up 53%. The company sees second-quarter revenue of $283.8 million to $287 million. That's up roughly 26% vs. a year earlier.In January it was profiled as an IBD New America company.

It's often a sign that institutional investors are adding to a current successful position, or buying the stock for the first time.After a breakout from a base in early May, health savings account provider HealthEquity paid a visit to its 10-week line last week. It wasn't a convincing case of support, though, as shares fell nearly 7% for the week. Still, the stock closed in the top half of its weekly range, ending just above the 10-week line. Shares are up 2.5% so far this week.Houston-based oil and gas producer Oasis Petroleum is also showing decent action around its 10-week line. A bounce off the support level during the week ended June 22 was compelling, but volume was light. Shares slumped nearly 6% last week but held above the support level. As of Tuesday's close, Oasis was still holding above the 10-week line, but interested buyers should wait for a bounce off the line with conviction before pulling the trigger.Inogen, a maker of portable oxygen concentrators for patients with chronic respiratory conditions, is also holding support at the 10-week line after a breakout from a base in April. But an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- gives pause. The rating is hurt, in part, by a heavy-volume drop for Inogen during the week ended May 26.

759,A,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE. It's driven not only by the shift of people moving from cash to virtual payments, but by people shifting their shopping online from physical retail stores.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:New ETF Aims To Provide A Steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

760,A,"Just when health care investors thought it was safe to dive back into retail pharmacy stocks, Amazon.com (AMZN) delivered a jolt on Thursday by buying PillPack, an online pharmacy that delivers prescriptions presorted by the dose. The move sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbling. Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) also retreated, along with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX).In April, Walmart (WMT) had reportedly been close to a deal to buy PillPack, nudging aside Amazon. Meanwhile, Amazon's feared shake-up of health care no longer looked quite so scary as the company shelved plans to deliver medical supplies.Now there will again be a focus on just how big of a threat Amazon represents to the prescription retail industry.

764,A,"Online fashion play Stitch Fix broke out of a new base and Apple continued to motor higher as the Nasdaq composite commanded the market upside, rising more than 1.3% during late-afternoon trading in stocks today.Clearly, large-cap techs in the fields of software, e-commerce, biotech and semiconductors led the way. The S&P 500 rallied nearly 0.9%, better than an almost 0.5% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average.A strong U.S. jobs report for June did not send bond investors fleeing the debt market. In fact, Treasuries saw good demand on the long end as Friday marked an official start of billions of dollars in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slipped 2 basis points to 2.82%.""The top-level takeaway is that the labor market remains consistent with robust economic growth but not yet tight enough to generate the kind of upward inflation pressures that would encourage the Fed to raise rates more rapidly,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at the mutual fund giant AB.  ""One very encouraging aspect of the labor market over a longer time horizon is that the employment/population ratio is steadily marching higher.""The U.S. economy added 213,000 jobs in June, higher than forecasts of 190,000. Average hourly wages rose 2.7% year over year, just below the 2.8% Econoday consensus forecast.Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Los Angeles-based money manager Payden & Rygel, points out that while nonsupervisory wage growth ""continues to slowly climb,"" he's not seeing evidence of an ""overheating"" economy. That particular factor of wage increases hit a current economic cycle high of 2.8% in June. Plus, manufacturing jobs increased by 36,000 amid widespread media coverage on the tit-for-tat tariffs on imports.""So, two very popular narratives (trade and overheating) are not seeing much love in the June jobs report,"" Cleveland told IBD.Stitch Fix (SFIX), which went public at $15 a share in November last year, is trying to surpass upside resistance near 30. The stock peaked at 30.07 in December, then began forming its first authentic base pattern.The San Francisco-based company is a small cap with a market value of $3.1 billion, a float of 27 million shares, and 97 million total shares outstanding.That base has a boxy shape and is not a double bottom, since the June 4 low of 18.02 did not undercut a first low of 18.00 seen four months earlier.Yet notice on the accompanying weekly chart how Stitch Fix's action shows several positive factors.One, the stock is leading the 10-week moving average, drawn in red, higher. Two, the relative strength line (painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith) is rocketing into new high ground. This means Stitch Fix is beating the pants off the S&P 500.Three, the strong weekly gain is not a fluke; Over the past five weeks, the e-commerce play had already seen three strong weekly gains in heavy volume. That's a strong clue the institutional crowd is accumulating shares.According to Stock Checkup, Stitch Fix holds a fantastic 97 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.That ranks it No. 4 in terms of this special rating, combining fundamental, stock price strength, and institutional sponsorship quality measures, within the Retail-Internet industry group. The Internet-Retail group itself is ranked No. 14 on a six-month relative basis among 197 industries tracked each day by IBD.Stitch Fix has turned in an annual profit for three years in a row, but quarterly earnings can be lumpy. Seasonality may be one factor. Plus, the company is new and so must invest heavily for future growth.Earnings fell 67% to 5 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in October, then slid 50% to 7 cents in the January-ended second quarter. But the bottom line jumped 200% to 9 cents a share in Q3 ended in April.The Street sees fiscal Q4 profit of 3 cents a share vs. a loss of one penny in the year-ago quarter.What has been consistent? Sales growth. The top line has bulged 139%, 51%, 35%, 26%, 26%, 25%, 24% and 29% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters. Analysts on consensus expect fiscal Q4 sales rising 23% to $317.7 million and FY 2018 sales up 26% to $1.23 billion.Top ranked within that group: Etsy (ETSY), the global online e-commerce platform for artisans, artists and photographers. Etsy is a member of IBD Leaderboard. The IBD premium service, started in 2011, helps investors pick outstanding growth stocks. The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard stocks get annotations in real time to pinpoint prime buy points and sell signals.Etsy joined the Leaders list on Feb. 28 as a full-sized position. At that time, shares gapped up and out of a well-formed cup without handle.That cup without handle featured a standard 21.96 buy point. Go to a Leaderboard daily chart to see the alternative entry.Today, Etsy is approaching the 45 price level.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to do heavy lifting for all the major indexes with a 1.2% jump to 187.61. At that price, it remains barely within the 5% buy zone.The iPhone, iMac, digital wearables and digital services giant has risen at a slow and steady pace since it cleared a proper double bottom and a 179.04 buy point.Please see this recent Stock Market Today piece on why Apple's improving fundamentals make the stock a difficult one to defy. As noted in the IBD ""Click"" all things tech blog on Friday, Apple got a price-target hike from Loop Capital on solid growth prospects for its new iPhones.Elsewhere in stocks today, gold mining, wholesale food, newspaper, major retail discount chain, alcohol and homebuilder stocks failed to join the buying fest. These groups and a few others fell 0.5% to 3.8%.Keep track of the top industry groups within IBD's ranking of 197, for the best growth stocks tend to hail from leading industries, not lagging ones.Biogen (BIIB), which has made big gains in past bull market cycles, looks eager to lead again.The stock, getting a boost from positive results in a middle-stage trial for a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, gapped up at the open and surged more than 19%. The intraday high of 367.89 came within less than 3 points of the new cup base's left-side peak.Biogen has grown earnings 22%, 4% and 16% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters on sales gains of 4%, 15% and 11%.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Biogen's Relative Price Strength Rating is a lowly 58 on a scale of 1 to 99. But after Friday's massive gain, expect that RS Rating to rise quickly.Focus on stocks with an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This means you'll put hard-earned money only in those companies that are outperforming at least 80% of the entire stock market over the past 12 months.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:What's New In The Top IBD Growth Screens?

770,A,"Dropbox (DBX), Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK) are new software IPO stocks that staged powerful breakouts earlier this month. But with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and now the Nasdaq composite retreating, these IPOs have given up all of their gains. Dropbox stock fell back into the 5% buy zone on Thursday, along with Zscaler and Carbon Black. Meanwhile, blistering China IPO stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) suffered double-digit declines Thursday.Dropbox stock closed below its buy point Friday, a big red flag. Zscaler and Carbon Black also undercut entry areas intraday. IQiyi and Huya continued to swing wildly, but still have most of their gains.Should you hold or cash out of these volatile stocks? That depends on your investing horizon and your conviction in these names. But you should have a plan. Here are investing guidelines to consider:If a top stock rises more than 10% from the buy point, you really don't want to see that double-digit gain turn into a loss.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox blasted 24.5% from a 34.93 buy point, but has tumbled all the way to 35.69, losing 4.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Zscaler ran up 26% from its entry, also 34.93, but has since retreated to 35.21, diving 7.1% on Wednesday. Carbon Black vaulted 35% from a 25.94 entry. But it fell 26.67, off 7.5% on Thursday.On Friday, Dropbox sank 5.5% to 33.72, round-tripping its run. Zscaler fell to 34.25 intraday, round-tripping its run-up, though it did rebound to close up 4% at 36.63  Carbon Black sank 2% to 26.14 after falling as low as 25.69, just below its 25.94 entry.If a stock pulls back to a breakout area, does it find support at its buy point? Dropbox stock didn't seem to find support at the buy point. Zscaler stock did find support around its buy point, ultimately. So, to a lesser extent, did fellow security software IPO stock Carbon Black.While IPO stocks Dropbox, Zscaler and Carbon Black have fallen sharply, those sell-offs have come in volume that, though heavy, was generally lighter than on the run-up.Do you think this stock and company are going to be big long-term winners? Perhaps you let the stock pull back further. If it's a more speculative, short-term trade, you might be quicker to take partial or total profits.That's a question not only for the software IPO trio, but the Chinese livestreaming IPO duo of iQiyi and Huya.IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, tumbled 12% on Thursday. Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock sank 5.7% after plunging 9% earlier.Whatever your investing strategy, have a plan. How far are you willing to let a stock fall before you act? When a serious pullback occurs, follow your coolheaded strategy and not your emotions.Remember, if a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, that's an absolute sell signal.If a stock falls and you sell, you can always get back in when a new buying opportunity appears.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesWhy These Explosive China Stocks Are Due For PullbacksIf You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 5 Biotech IPOs Jump In Debuts

774,A,"For Canada-based apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica (LULU), new things are happening in a foursome.• The first item is who will emerge from the company's CEO search. In the upscale retail space, an imaginative leader can make a big difference. Thanks to recent acceleration in quarterly earnings and sales, Lululemon's top spot could be attractive to top-tier candidates.Earnings growth stepped up from 3% to 19%, 33% and 72% in the past three quarters. Revenue stepped up from 5% to 13%, 14%, 18% and 25% in the past four quarters.• The second item is overseas expansion. Lululemon has 15 stores in China, including three in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan.At the May 27 earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden noted that Lululemon has ""the greatest amount of (its) new store openings happening in China.""Store growth outside North America is ""still in the early innings,"" Haselden said.Ten years ago, the U.S. and Canada accounted for 91% of Lululemon's store count. As of April 29, North America's share dropped to 81%, despite a massive increase in the U.S. store count.Only four nations were in the store count in early 2008: Canada, the U.S., Australia and Japan. Countries since added include New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland, Germany, South Korea, Ireland and China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.Lululemon plans to open 40 to 50 stores in 2018, including 20 to 30 in the international space.• The third item is men's lines. Amid eye-rolling skepticism, Lululemon began focusing more on men's clothes in 2013.How is it going? Of new customers acquired in Q1, ""about 30% of them were men. So, that was higher than the overall level of increase, a little bit higher than the number of women that we're attracting,"" Haselden said.Yet, just how far that card can be played isn't clear. Sales aren't reported by gender in company filings.• The fourth item is lower markdowns. This reflects in part Lululemon's determination to remain an upscale brand that can command full prices. It also points to an improving world economy.""We can continue to drive a very healthy full-priced business,"" Haselden said on the call. ""We see that continuing into Q2 and the balance of the year.""Stock charts don't lie, so what is Lululemon's chart confessing?The action from August 2016 to August 2017 was sloppy and ugly. But after settling down, the stock began to rise in a steady fashion last November.Lululemon's most recent entry was a pullback to the 10-week moving average in March. It's well extended.Individual investors might want to put Lululemon on a watch list in the hope that it will form a base.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:IBD's Stock Of The DayContrafund Likes This Oil StockApple's Plan On Video Content Is UnclearStock Market Is Sending Trump A Message

Going into Friday's session, the Nasdaq Spotlight stocks were up 18.4% vs. 2.6% for the NYSE Spotlight stocks.Given that the Spotlight focuses on stocks with strong fundamentals and issues that are often in a base, an investor might not expect which index a particular stock is in to be critical. But arguing with the market is a bad idea.Two medical-sector stocks in the Spotlight, as of Friday morning, are also Nasdaq issues.Midcap portable oxygen tank maker Inogen (INGN) is up 98% year to date. Investors might assume that the money has been made in this stock and the run is over. They might be right. But several observations are worth considering.First, IBD's usual target is for taking profits at 20% to 25%. The stock doesn't have to double again to reach such a goal.

That's a bullish sign.However, Inogen is neither No. 1 nor No. 2 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. IBD-style investors prefer to buy the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in a group.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoogle and these 4,000 employees embody two terrible traits: moral idiocy and ingratitude.Moral idiocy is the ability to be brilliant in any area of life except the single most important area of life, morality. With regard to morality, such people are fools.The United States has been the greatest force for liberty and goodness in world history. It has been so by modeling a free society and through the power of the idea of freedom, and even more so by force — brute physical force.Through force of arms, America and its allies defeated Germany in World War I and World War II.Through force of arms, America imposed democracy and liberty on West Germany and led to the dissolution of East Germany.Through force of arms, the Holocaust — the genocide of Europe's Jews and millions of others in Nazi concentration and death camps — ended. If Google existed then, would its employees have demanded Google ""not be in the business of war""?Through force of arms, America was able to impose democracy and liberty on Japan.Through force of arms, America liberated Asian countries from the Nazi-like Japanese imperialists.Through force of arms, America enabled the majority of Koreans to live free rather than under the most totalitarian regime in modern history, North Korea.Through force of arms, Israel has survived 70 years of Arab, and now Iranian, attempts to annihilate it. Arms ended the Holocaust in Europe, and arms prevent a second Holocaust of Jews in the Middle East.Only a moral idiot does not understand the moral necessity of weapons of war being in the hands of decent countries.Which brings us to the second trait of Google and its employees: ingratitude.Google and its employees live better than almost any human beings in the world. They do so because they live in the freest and most opportunity-giving country in the world, the United States of America.That Google and its employees refuse to work on the military defense of their country is an expression of ingratitude (not to mention absence of patriotism) that is simply breathtaking.How did we produce such foolish and ungrateful people?They are the products of left-wing education and the left-wing media, and of living in the left-wing cocoon of Northern California and its tech industry.Google should be true to its convictions and change just one word of its original slogan from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Don't fight evil.""

783,A,"In the wake of Comcast (CMCSA) making a higher, all-cash bid for 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Disney (DIS) is expected to add cash to its offer for the entertainment conglomerate, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, Pivotal Research Group downgraded Disney stock to sell from hold, citing the risk from paying more for Fox.Disney agreed in late 2017 to acquire Fox's entertainment and studio assets for over $52 billion. But Comcast's $65 billion cash bid represents a 19% premium to Disney's bid. Comcast is more confident that its deal would pass antitrust muster after AT&T (T) got a federal judge's OK last week to close its Time Warner acquisition.Disney shares finished 1.6% lower at 107.06 in the stock market today. Disney stock remains above its 50-day and 200-day averages after retaking both lines in recent weeks.Comcast stock sank 3.8%, testing its 50-day and still well below its 200-day line. Fox stock dipped 0.2%.Comcast is in a separate sparring match with Fox over Europe-based broadcaster Sky: Comcast in April offered $31 billion for Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake. Fox had in late 2016 bid 10.75 euros a share for the remaining part of Sky that it did not already own.The battle for Fox's assets includes its movie and TV studios, certain TV networks such as FX and National Geographic, Fox's regional sports networks, certain international properties, as well as Fox's current stake in Sky and Hulu.Both Disney and Comcast see the need for more content to compete with Netflix and others. Disney plans to launch a streaming channel in 2019, taking on Netflix (NFLX). Meanwhile, Disney and Comcast would hold a majority share of Hulu via a Fox purchase.Fox said in December that it will spin off its remaining news and sports networks — including Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports and Fox Broadcasting Company — into a new ""Fox.""Analysts at Pivotal Research Group downgraded Disney on the Fox negotiations.If the Fox purchase price rises due to the Disney-Comcast bidding war, then ""Disney's value would be negatively impacted as it would reduce the incremental value the company should be able to generate from synergies associated with the acquisition,"" wrote Pivotal's Brian Wieser, in a note acquired by Fast Company.Elsewhere in the media realm, Viacom (VIAB) shares advanced 1%.

784,A,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

The Arlington, Va.-based utility with an international customer base was up as much as 22% this year before a recent drop trimmed the stock's gain to 17%.The stock's relative strength rating is 79, which means AES is outperforming almost eight of every 10 stocks in IBD's database.A midcap, AES pays an annualized dividend of 52 cents a share, which is 43% of its estimated earnings for 2018. The payout is only 16% of cash flow per share.According to IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co., the dividend growth rate is a stunning 32%.Part of the reason for the fast growth in the dividend is that the company only began paying dividends in late 2012.Going into Wednesday's session, the annualized yield was 4%.After two years of declining earnings, AES increased earnings 14% in 2017. The Street expects earnings to grow earnings 11% and 9% in 2018-19.CEO Andres Gluski at the May 8 earnings call noted that the company is undergoing a transformation.Recent steps include selling the company's Philippine assets for $1 billion and using most of the money to pay down debt. AES also ""derisked"" a hydroelectric project in Chile by signing a new fixed-price construction contract.Gluski's goal is a $100 million cost reduction.The company laid off 12% of its global workforce, ""including eliminating 30% of management positions,"" Gluski said at the call.AES provides energy to 15 countries.RELATED:IBD's Stock Of The DayFacebook Fends Off CriticsGet Real: The Myth Investors Need To DropThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

Global supply chains mean that U.S.-made cars typically have a high share of foreign parts, so Trump tariffs could raise costs substantially. Also, Europe likely would retaliate.No. 2 U.S. carmaker Ford said Thursday it has no plans to hike imported Ford and Lincoln prices in China, as a potential tariff war escalates, Reuters said.China cut tariffs on all auto imports days ago.But it plans to hit back with a tit-for-tat additional 25% levy on American products, including cars, if the U.S. proceeds with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports starting Friday.Daimler last month warned on full-year earnings, citing in part the U.S.-China trade fight.RBC's Spak also noted ""solid"" car registrations in the European Union in June, up more than 1% year over year. The region saw strong demand for gas and plug-in vehicles, while poor diesel sales weighed on the month, he said.""This highlights the accelerating shift away from diesel in Europe,"" Spak added. ""This bears monitoring for suppliers with diesel portfolios"" such as Borg Warner (BWA), Delphi Technologies (DLPH), and Tenneco (TEN).Shares of all three auto parts giants rose solidly Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

797,A,"In a welcome move, Worldpay (WP) saw its Relative Strength Rating rise from 70 to 74 on Thursday. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily identifies price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their largest runs.

See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksWorldpay broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 83.94 entry from a double bottom. If a stock you're watching clears a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. The company reported 19% earnings growth last quarter. Sales increased -8%. The company holds the No. 15 rank among its peers in the Finance-Card/Payment Processing industry group.

798,A,"After running up three weeks in a row, gaining nearly 11% in the process, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is taking a well-needed breather.But with the stock dropping as much as 6% intraday Monday, should shareholders lock in gains?Answering this question spurs a pair of questions. First, would you be happy with a profit of 20% in a short period of time since Supernus cleared its latest correct buy point? If yes, then the recent action has justified a move to sell on the way up.The expert in treatments for epilepsy and migraine headaches broke out of a nearly eight-month cup with handle May 9. Volume was sharply above average, yet the stock closed below the 49.85 entry. No matter. Supernus kept climbing. At the end of a six-day spurt, the small-cap growth stock rose to a high of 59.05, up a stout 18%.The base is first stage.In the past two weeks, Supernus reached the 20% profit level as shares tried to conquer price resistance at 60. Selling most of your winners when the gain reaches 20% to 25% is smart portfolio management.And nabbing such a double-digit profit during a market in which the S&P 500 has risen just 1.7% during the first six months of 2018? It's like a scoring a goal against a World Cup contender from well outside the penalty area.At the same time, Supernus hasn't flashed any defensive sell signals.As a weekly chart shows, the stock has maintained firm support along the 10-week moving average.After a long run-up, a sharp plunge through the 10-week line, usually in volume that jumps 40% or more about average, typically signals that a good stock is ready to correct sharply in price and possibly form a new base.Investors can benefit in their portfolio decisions by asking themselves this: How much conviction do I have in the company itself?Judging by Supernus' recent results, a decision to try to hold longer and see if the company can, at one point, achieve midcap status is reasonable.In the year 2014, the Rockville, Md., company hit a milestone on the top line. Revenue hit $122 million, breaking the $100 million mark. Yet the relatively young company, incorporated in 2005, lost money for a fifth straight year. But in 2015, Supernus made another key milestone. It earned 28 cents a share as revenue jumped 21% to $147 million.Since then, growth has stayed hot.In 2017, Supernus earned $1.26 a share, up 350% from 2015. Sales broke the $300 million barrier on an annual basis, growing 41% to $302 million.In the past four quarters, the top line jumped 47%, 42%, 42% and 57%. It looks increasingly likely that the company will soon achieve $100 million in sales in a single quarter.For the first quarter this year, Supernus said that total product prescriptions for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR rose 49% to 200,878.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the stock's 99 Earnings Per Share Rating places it in the No. 1 rank within IBD's biotech industry group.Supernus also makes the Sector Leaders screen. As noted on a Leaderboard daily and weekly chart, Supernus recently created a narrow five-week flat base that produced a new buy point at 59.15.The breakout past that entry has been less than savory so far. The gain from that new correct buy point?

Shares edged lower in the premarket.Microsoft stock has generally tracked the rising 50-day moving average for more than a year. Meanwhile, breakouts have halting, making little progress and typically undercutting the buy point.

815,A,"President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Wednesday as he seeks to preserve a deal to rescue Chinese communications equipment giant ZTE that may hold the key to averting a bruising China trade war.""We're working on it,"" Trump said of White House efforts to address congressional concerns that going soft on ZTE sends the wrong signal about taking on China over intellectual property theft, which has national security dimensions.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a ZTE critic, expressed optimism after the meeting to reports.""I think there's a path forward to address the president's concerns as well as national security,"" Cornyn said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy late July, if not sooner, we'll know whether Trump prevailed over Congress and whether a China trade war is really on.On Monday, the Senate voted 85-10 to reinstate a ban on U.S. component suppliers selling their wares to ZTE, without which it's had to halt operations. The move was a direct challenge to Trump, who had softened the Commerce Department's penalty for repeated violations of sanctions on North Korea and Iran and pledged via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast.""If Trump really intended to launch a major China trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs. Yet late Monday, Trump escalated his threats toward China, directing his administration to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Investors took the threat seriously, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking close to 300 points as Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and other companies with big exposure to China came under pressure. But Trump's saber-rattling appears aimed at Congress, not Beijing. If Trump appears tough enough on China and lawmakers begin to worry about a full-scale China trade war, they'll be more likely to bow to the White House's wishes with respect to ZTE.The Dow Jones edged lower on Wednesday, declining for a seventh straight session. But the Nasdaq composite hit a record high, advancing 0.7%.If the U.S. backs off its harsh sentence for one of China's premier tech hardware firms, the countries might be able to work on a trade deal that Trump was crowing about just a month ago. China had agreed to buy an additional $70 billion worth of American goods, including ""massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products."" But as the U.S. pushed for further concessions, Beijing appeared to walk away from the bargaining table as the Senate moves put ZTE's fate in jeopardy.While U.S.-China negotiations are suspended, the clock is ticking toward the July 6 start of a trade war. That's when the U.S. said it will apply 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports. Beijing has said that it plans to immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar. Another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports could face tariffs shortly after July 6, pending further review.But the process may come to a standstill if Congress acts quickly. The Senate's ZTE provision is part of a must-pass defense-funding bill. But the Senate version must be merged with House legislation that would apply much narrower restrictions on ZTE. It's not clear whether the final bill will come together before the July 4 recess. So a China trade war could stay on a low boil for the next month or so, until ZTE's fate becomes clear.July 25 is another key date. That's the latest deadline for the Qualcomm (QCOM) merger agreement with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Like the rest of the U.S. trade negotiation with China, the deal appears tied to the fate of ZTE. Chinese regulators have refused to grant antitrust approval to the chip merger, but appear ready to do so when the ZTE ban is lifted.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:If You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

816,A,"If you are new to buying or selling growth stocks when they break out, you might wonder what to do when this happens: A leader crosses above a proper buy point, then falls below it by day's end. This is exactly what the biotech stock Biogen, a former true market leader, did back in early 2013.Should you sell and hit the ejector button?Not always. Even if the stock is below your purchase price and beneath the proper entry, such action is not an absolute reason to exit the position. IBD research has found that as many as four out of 10 great winners will test the buy point after a breakout. Some stocks do so a few weeks after the start of a big move up. Others simply do so the same day as the breakout itself.The time to sell quickly? When you have to cut losses at 7% to 8%. You could also get out if the price-and-volume action is repeatedly poor, as noted in an Investor's Corner published on June 29.A close below the breakout point could highlight worsening market conditions. Do you check IBD's current outlook regularly? See it in Market Pulse, found in each day's The Big Picture column. If the market is selling off and the outlook is weak, consider raising some cash. Is it still a confirmed uptrend? If yes, then hold the stock.It's always vital to check that you've picked a true industry leader in a top-performing sector. Let's review Biogen (BIIB) as it vaulted past a 155.40 trigger point in a well-formed base on Jan. 28, 2013.At one point, shares rallied 7.3% to as high as 156.94. Yet by day's end, Biogen had risen 2.6% to 149.99, nearly 6 points below the breakout point. Volume bulged 130% above the 50-day average, a good sign.On Dec. 31, 2012, IBD upgraded the market outlook to ""uptrend resumes"" just as the Nasdaq gained 2% in heavy volume. By the time Biogen broke out, the Nasdaq marked only two distribution days, or significant declines by key indexes in higher volume. Therefore, the market was acting right.Biogen rallied more than 80%, peaked at 157.18 on Sept. 26, 2012 (1), then formed the 18-week cup with handle. A 14.8% drop within the base hinted that large funds weren't selling en masse. Biogen bottomed at its 200-day moving average, then rebounded within 2 points of the cup's left-side high. (See a historical chart on MarketSmith to view the 200-day line.) The handle was long, yet Biogen didn't undercut the 200-day line again.A 10% drop from the handle's high (2) to low met the maximum allowed decline of 12%. The handle slanted lower along the lows. Perfect. Why care about a good handle? Think of it as one final brief and light shakeout of uncommitted holders right before the stock muscles out of the base.After the wild breakout day, big sellers hid in the shadows. Biogen rose in six of the next seven sessions. On Feb. 6 (3), the stock traded 7.6% past the proper entry, leaving the 5% buy zone. At the time, the firm was building its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera into a revenue powerhouse. Biogen's sales jumped 26% in 2013 to a record $6.93 billion. Earnings grew 37% to $8.96 a share.Two years later in May 2015, Biogen peaked at 480.18, up 209%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How To Use Stock Charts And Find The Correct Buy Point For Virtually Any StockThe Latest Changes To IBD's Growth Stock Lists: Go HereGlobal Stock LeadersThe Best Large Caps Today: Inside IBD Big Cap 20This Should Happen In Every Stock Breakout

It's often a sign that institutional investors are adding to a current successful position, or buying the stock for the first time.After a breakout from a base in early May, health savings account provider HealthEquity paid a visit to its 10-week line last week. It wasn't a convincing case of support, though, as shares fell nearly 7% for the week. Still, the stock closed in the top half of its weekly range, ending just above the 10-week line. Shares are up 2.5% so far this week.Houston-based oil and gas producer Oasis Petroleum is also showing decent action around its 10-week line. A bounce off the support level during the week ended June 22 was compelling, but volume was light. Shares slumped nearly 6% last week but held above the support level. As of Tuesday's close, Oasis was still holding above the 10-week line, but interested buyers should wait for a bounce off the line with conviction before pulling the trigger.Inogen, a maker of portable oxygen concentrators for patients with chronic respiratory conditions, is also holding support at the 10-week line after a breakout from a base in April. But an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- gives pause. The rating is hurt, in part, by a heavy-volume drop for Inogen during the week ended May 26. Inogen has recovered nicely, albeit in light trade, as it trades tightly near the 10-week line.China-based package delivery firm ZTO Express is getting support after a base breakout during the week ended May 25.

Visa stock found support at its 50-day moving average this past week, MarketSmith analysis shows.In what could be a key development in the online shopping era, Visa could abandon its faster-online-checkout option. Instead it would adopt a single shared-payment button for online payments with Mastercard (MA).Visa also has an alliance with PayPal. Users can now even draw on their Visa to pay for something via their phone in physical retail locations.

Indeed its annual price increase of 15.3% for the year has easily outstripped that of its more glamorous long-term rival Apple (AAPL), up 9.4%. In its most recent quarter the Redmond giant scored a double beat, with EPS up 36% to 95 cents and sales jumping 16% to $26.8 billion.In a somewhat similar pattern to Visa, Microsoft stock hasn't rallied much since clearing a six-week flat base in May.

Boeing stock flashed a sell signal on Monday after China ""firmed up"" commitments to purchase jets from European rival Airbus (EADSY) amid the spiraling trade war with the U.S.However Boeing orders remain strong, with India's Jet Airways this week announcing an agreement Monday to purchase 75 Boeing 737 Max jets.The Dow Jones aerospace giant is exploring new areas of innovation. Boeing unveiled a concept hypersonic jet at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation 2018 conference in Atlanta.

820,A,"The Trump administration on Saturday announced the suspension of risk adjustment, a central part of ObamaCare meant to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.Although it's unclear how long the suspension will last, it's hard to underestimate the extent to which this will explode ObamaCare state insurance markets if not lifted soon.Suspension of risk-adjustment payments from insurers with relatively low-cost customers to those that take on a higher-cost group of customers has huge financial implications for ObamaCare insurers. Centene (CNC) — the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, with 1.6 million customers — owes $620 million for risk adjustment in 2017, according to updated data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but that payment is on hold.In 2018, Centene expects to pay $1.1 billion for risk adjustment. Even with its risk-adjustment payments, Centene makes a profit on the ObamaCare exchanges. If it were to be freed from making such payments, the impact on earnings would be massive. Centene's overall corporate net earnings in 2017 totaled $828 million.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe financial implications are even bigger for Molina Health (MOH), which has an $850 million risk-adjustment liability for 2017. Molina had been assuming a $912 million risk-adjustment liability for last year.In Monday stock market trading, Centene stock edged up 0.1%, while Molina Health stock rose 3.2%. Both Centene and Molina Health hit record highs intraday.Yet, on other side of the coin, Centene's and Molina's liability represents risk-adjustment receivables due to other companies for which the suspension of the program could be disastrous. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida is owed $617 million under risk adjustment for 2017. Anthem (ANTM) is owed about $400 million to $500 million, according to JPMorgan.Anthem stock, which got a BMO Capital upgrade and price target hike, rose 2.7%.The Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association released a statement warning that the Trump administration's move ""will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices.""Something will have to give. Either insurers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida will drop out of the market, or they will tailor their plans to make them less appealing to people with chronic conditions, who expect to run up high medical bills, much as Centene appears to have done. Simply raising prices may not seem like a workable option if it drives away relatively healthy customers, leaving some insurers with an even sicker group.Every time that other insurers have fled ObamaCare amid criticism of its rules and its relatively costly consumers, Centene has turned it into opportunity — and it could happen again. Centene is ranked No. 1 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends.Dow Jones component UnitedHealth (UNH), which exited ObamaCare exchanges previously, rose 1.2%. UnitedHealth stock is in buy range from a 249.27 handle entry.The Department of Health and Human Services justified its decision based on a February decision in a case brought by a New Mexico insurer that challenged the workings of risk adjustment. In a different case brought in Massachusetts, a judge rejected an insurer's challenge to the program.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Discount Chains: These 4 Top Stocks Are In Or Near Buy ZonesWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying?

821,A,"IPO stock Gardner Denver (GDI) is shaping the right side of a new base formation.XWhile the company is on the IPO Leaders list, it was founded in 1859. The company was taken private by private equity firm KKR in 2013 for $3.9 billion before debuting again in the stock market on May 12, 2017.Gardner makes industrial compressors, blowers, pumps, loading arms, fuel systems and other aftermarket parts.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales growth increased 280% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow 50% in 2018 and 9% in 2019.According to Goldman Sachs, Gardner is seeing strong growth in all three of its businesses — energy, industrial and medical. The broad-based increase in orders and share gains in industrial were particularly encouraging, while incremental margin improvements show the company's ability to raise prices and maintain cost controls.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating and a 36 price target on the stock — about 5% from Thursday's midday price.Within the industrial machinery industry group — which is ranked No. 85 out of 197 groups — Gardner is the No. 2-ranked stock, with a strong 91 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics.After a solid run-up from an initial cup with handle's 24.44 buy point in September, the industrial company is finally forming a second base.The stock's 24%-deep cup-shaped base shows a 38.10 buy point — according to MarketSmith chart analysis — but a handle may be forming. If the week closes with a loss, the new risk-optimal entry will be 35.38. Shares are about 10% away from the new high entry, but just 3% under the potential handle buy point.According to the IBD Stock Checkup, the stock has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Meanwhile, the relative strength line is nearing a new high, indicating strong market outperformance.RELATED:Yes, Technology Still Rules, As This Tech-Sector Play ShowsThese Stocks Are In Or Near Buy Zones Ahead Of Earnings: Investing Action PlanRoss Stores Reclaims Buy Zone With Earnings On TapIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

830,A,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE.

831,A,"The decision to sell a stock depends on your time frame. Where position trading looks at holding a stock for a couple of months, swing trading focuses on just a couple of weeks. The shorter trade requires more sensitive sell rules. That extra sensitivity led us to sell Alibaba stock on IBD's SwingTrader but hold Alibaba on IBD's Leaderboard.The traditional buy point on Alibaba (BABA) showed a 201.60 entry from a double-bottom base. An early entry presented itself as the stock hit resistance multiple times around 200. We added Alibaba to IBD's SwingTrader on May 25 as the price crossed that area, but it didn't hold above it by the close (1). The next day, Alibaba challenged the price level again but failed (2). With the market still trading flat, we took half the position off the table as a cautionary measure.A few days later, the stock recovered and cleared its traditional buy point (3). Buying the shares back would be an option at this point. The relative strength line cleared new highs more definitively (3) than at our original buy (1). But volume was a little light for a traditional breakout and the market was just starting to regain steam.Alibaba continued to make progress and reached our 5% profit goal as it crossed 210 (4). Normally, this would trigger our rule to sell half the position. In this case, since we only had a half position, it changed the math. That would leave us with a quarter-position size. It's hard to make much impact when your position size gets too small. You can also fall into the trap of ignoring losses because they are smaller and holding stocks longer than necessary. We decided to hold Alibaba early in the day for a 10% profit goal. We still raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry. But, we saw another bearish reversal (4) by the close leaving us less certain.The following day, Alibaba didn't participate in a strong market move and we removed the remaining shares around 208 (5). The change in character was enough to suggest that the stock might struggle over the next few days. That's not something you want to sit with in a swing trade. For a position trade, the decision could be different. That's why the stock stayed on IBD's Leaderboard at the time. Different sell rules apply to swing trades over position trades.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leaderboard is already up over 21% year-to-date while the S&P 500's gain is under 4%. Alibaba is one of 11 stocks on the Leaders List. Trial subscriptions are available. The decision to sell Alibaba stock worked well for the swing trade. The next day it was down nearly 3% closing well below its 5-day moving average line (6). More than a week later and it's still trading around the same level as our sell. As for Leaderboard, the stock is still contributing to profits there. Its relative strength line is still holding up and Alibaba got support at its 10-day moving average line. Its fundamental story of retail dominance in China is compelling. The different sell decisions may prove to both be correct for their respective time frames.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Swing Trading Versus Position Trading: When To Take ProfitsWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing Trades Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

834,A,"U.S. President Donald Trump accused Harley-Davidson (HOG) of using new tariffs on trade as cover for an existing plan to shift some production abroad and threatened the motorcycle manufacturer with a ""big tax"" on bikes imported to the U.S. if it relocates some plants overseas.X""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country — never!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!""The company said in a government filing Monday that it may move some production outside the U.S. in response to European retaliation for the president's tariffs on imported metals.But Trump took issue with that in a series of early-morning tweets Tuesday.""Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it,"" Trump said.The president followed up by warning the company that goods produced overseas and imported back into the U.S. could be taxed. ""Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Trump said on Twitter.A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a ""Plan B"" that Harley employed after the U.S. abandoned the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year. He'd said they didn't relish the investment, which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market.The early-morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker, after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump's penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said.Harley shares fell 1.3% in early trading Tuesday in New York after tumbling 6% Monday, the biggest drop in almost five months. The stock is down 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!""In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years through bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump's ""trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.""""The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,"" Sanders told reporters at the White House.Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman (BFB), which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25% tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel's, would amount to about a 10% increase for consumers.Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that ""we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.""Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.The EU's levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump's trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as ""a true American icon"" and ""one of the greats.""""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,"" Trump said at the time. ""I think you're going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.""Harley-Davidson's headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump's move to impose tariffs, said the company's announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president's trade policy.""This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,"" AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. ""The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.""Lawmakers weighed in Tuesday on Trump's latest tweets.""What I'm worried about is that it's just the first of many that we are going to see as a result of tariffs,"" Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told CNN in an interview to discuss Harley's announcement that it would move some production abroad.""I don't know all the details but from what I saw was it would be a $2,200 increase on the final price per bike with these tariffs,"" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told CNN in a separate interview. ""That's going to impact sales.""""I don't have a problem with the president taking on China,"" Kinzinger added.

836,A,"The decision to sell a stock depends on your time frame. Where position trading looks at holding a stock for a couple of months, swing trading focuses on just a couple of weeks. The shorter trade requires more sensitive sell rules. That extra sensitivity led us to sell Alibaba stock on IBD's SwingTrader but hold Alibaba on IBD's Leaderboard.The traditional buy point on Alibaba (BABA) showed a 201.60 entry from a double-bottom base. An early entry presented itself as the stock hit resistance multiple times around 200. We added Alibaba to IBD's SwingTrader on May 25 as the price crossed that area, but it didn't hold above it by the close (1). The next day, Alibaba challenged the price level again but failed (2). With the market still trading flat, we took half the position off the table as a cautionary measure.A few days later, the stock recovered and cleared its traditional buy point (3). Buying the shares back would be an option at this point. The relative strength line cleared new highs more definitively (3) than at our original buy (1). But volume was a little light for a traditional breakout and the market was just starting to regain steam.Alibaba continued to make progress and reached our 5% profit goal as it crossed 210 (4). Normally, this would trigger our rule to sell half the position. In this case, since we only had a half position, it changed the math. That would leave us with a quarter-position size. It's hard to make much impact when your position size gets too small. You can also fall into the trap of ignoring losses because they are smaller and holding stocks longer than necessary. We decided to hold Alibaba early in the day for a 10% profit goal. We still raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry. But, we saw another bearish reversal (4) by the close leaving us less certain.The following day, Alibaba didn't participate in a strong market move and we removed the remaining shares around 208 (5). The change in character was enough to suggest that the stock might struggle over the next few days. That's not something you want to sit with in a swing trade. For a position trade, the decision could be different. That's why the stock stayed on IBD's Leaderboard at the time. Different sell rules apply to swing trades over position trades.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leaderboard is already up over 21% year-to-date while the S&P 500's gain is under 4%. Alibaba is one of 11 stocks on the Leaders List. Trial subscriptions are available. The decision to sell Alibaba stock worked well for the swing trade. The next day it was down nearly 3% closing well below its 5-day moving average line (6). More than a week later and it's still trading around the same level as our sell. As for Leaderboard, the stock is still contributing to profits there. Its relative strength line is still holding up and Alibaba got support at its 10-day moving average line. Its fundamental story of retail dominance in China is compelling.

837,A,"Comcast (CMCSA) launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) on Wednesday, offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company and at a 19% premium over Walt Disney's (DIS) offer.Comcast's takeover bid had been expected in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory late Tuesday that cleared its purchase of Time Warner (TWX). The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox.Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.Disney, however, in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseComcast fell 0.7% to 32 in after-hours trading on the stock market today while Disney slipped 0.3% to 105.90. Fox rose 1.6% to 44.13. In Wednesday's regular session, Fox popped 7.4% to 43.41. Comcast edged down 0.2% to 32.32. Disney gained 1.9% to 106.30.While Wall Street fears a bidding war, one scenario is that the companies carve up Fox, with Comcast getting Sky as well as video streaming service Hulu and perhaps other assets.Disney's deal includes Fox's stake in U.K.-based Sky, a film studio, cable networks and other assets. It excludes the Fox Broadcasting Network. Disney already owns broadcaster ABC.One obstacle to a truce is the history between the companies. A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction. MoffettNathanson also downgraded AT&T to sell.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.Shares in CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and other media firms rose in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory.The landmark antitrust victory over the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media assets by telecoms or even internet companies, such as Amazon.com (AMZN).Viacom (VIA) gained 0.7% to 33.55 while CBS was up 3.6% to 54.27. Discovery rose 1.6% to 24.41. Lions Gate closed up 3% to 24.87 after jumping nearly 9% earlier. Media and cable TV industry baron John Malone owns stakes in Discovery, Lionsgate and Starz.Malone is chairman of Liberty Media (LSXMA). Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA), meanwhile, is the biggest shareholder in Charter Communications (CHTR). Charter fell 2% to 285. Charter is the second-biggest cable TV firm behind Comcast.Shares in Dish Network (DISH) climbed 1.4% to 32.86.Verizon Communications (VZ) fell 3% to 47.40.

"
838,A,"The cup-with-handle chart pattern is to serious investors what the single is to a baseball fan. It's the starting point for scoring runs and winning the investing game.Among the eight principal base patterns — including the flat base, double bottom, saucer, base on base, ascending base, IPO base, and high, tight flag — the cup with handle remains to this day one of the most successful.Why? Simple. Over the centuries, human nature hasn't changed. Greed, fear, hope, despair and other emotions drive stock prices. So do the laws of supply and demand.This is why sifting through the charts of the market's greatest winners is time well worth spent.As you'll see, the general shape of the cup with handle and other critical chart patterns appear over and over again. That's why they give the prepared investor an edge in the stock market. (You can sift through more than a century of history among the greatest stock market winners by going to the fourth edition of William O'Neil's classic, ""How To Make Money In Stocks,"" and studying Chapter 1.)So let's dissect this base. This is something you should know inside out. You need to know if that cup with handle is as it should be, or if it has flaws.The stock needs to show a 30% uptrend from any price point, but it must be before the base's construction. Or, the stock must show a minimum 20% increase from a prior breakout.The cup with handle must be at least seven weeks long. If there is no handle, then the cup itself must stretch a minimum six weeks.The handle alone needs at least five days to form, but it could go on for weeks. Make sure it doesn't exceed the cup portion in time or size of decline. A good cup with handle should truly look like the silhouette of a nicely formed tea cup. The handle always shows a smaller decline from high to low; it represents a final shakeout of uncommitted holders, sending those shares into sturdier hands in the market.In most cases, the decline from high to low should not exceed 8% to 12%. During bear markets, some good cup with handle bases show a large, double-digit decline within the handle. But again, it should not exceed the drop within the cup.The handle usually begins with a down day in price. Be aware that the handle itself, which must stretch for a minimum five trading sessions, can morph into a base of its own in certain cases. That's not a problem; it's often a stock's way of offering a buy point that's clearer or lower than that suggested by the larger pattern.The handle should form in the upper part of the entire pattern. If it's too low, it's flawed.One way to check if that handle is proper: use the simple midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the handle and divide by 2. That number should be greater than the midpoint of the actual base itself.Let's take the cup with handle fashioned by Baidu (BIDU) (see the chart below) in 2007. In the cup base, the high was 134.10 and the low was 92.80. Add the two prices together and divide by 2 and you get a base midpoint of 113.45. The handle showed a high of 132.80 and a low of 120.25, and its midpoint of 126.53 easily exceeded the cup's midpoint.The handle should also show a downward slope along at least a portion of its price lows, not an upward one.An upward-sloping handle is flawed; it represents weak demand as new buyers move into the stock at a trickling pace. During the stock's actual breakout, you want to see a new wave of buyers coming in at a torrid pace, not a trickling one.Also, a steep, high-volume decline should put you on alert. You don't want to buy a stock that institutional investors couldn't wait to unload at any price.The cup should form smoothly, without major price declines on the left side. Sharp gains on the right side aren't necessarily good, either. You might think that the opposite of a panic-driven exit would be a good thing. Likely not.Try to limit your picks to cups that are no more than 30% or 33% deep, except for those built during a bear market. In that case, an exceptional growth stock can fall 40%, 50% or more and still make a successful breakout.Still, shallower is better. It shows that the big hands are catching the stock.Look for volume to dry up along the lows of the base. Volume should be light in the handle, too.Tighter price action is better. This is true of almost all bases. A loose, choppy base shows the stock needs to go far for price discovery. If institutions are holding on to the stock, it won't fall too far.This, of course, is where all the above parameters lead if they appear correctly. The buy point from a cup-with-handle base appears at the highest point of the handle, plus 10 cents. In the case of former big winner Baidu, the proper buy point during its May 14, 2007, breakout was 132.90, a dime above the handle's intraday high of 132.80.Less than six months later, the leading Chinese web search engine rocketed to 428, up 222%.Even if all other parameters come together, you should avoid stocks that break out below their 10-week moving average.Also, when the stock is breaking out, you should generally see a rush in turnover. Volume should ideally rise at least 40% above its 50-day average. For small and midcap stocks, expect breakout volume to double or triple.The daily and weekly charts at both Investors.com and MarketSmith make heavy turnover easy to spot. Simply compare the day or week's volume with the moving average line drawn across the volume bars. An Investors.com chart will also tell you in real time how volume is running in comparison with typical level at that time of the trading session.For the weekly chart, the moving-average line traces 10 weeks' worth of turnover.What should you do if volume on breakout day is much lighter than usual? Sometimes volume will pick up in the next few sessions. Light volume in the market in general may also be a factor. Also consider that the breakout may have started later in the day.O'Neil has often said at past IBD seminars that after a stock breaks out, he wants to see weekly volume rise vs. the prior week. This signifies a sudden shift in demand for shares that could continue to build up.Are quarterly results coming up? If so, traders often hesitate before the news. But if the stock fails to make much headway in price, the relative strength line is fading, and the market itself is not showing positive action then something may be wrong with the timing of the breakout.At that point, it makes sense to exit the stock, even if the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule has not yet been triggered.(Editor's Note: A version of this column was first published in the July 9, 2010, edition of IBD.

Dropbox stock fell back into the 5% buy zone on Thursday, along with Zscaler and Carbon Black. Meanwhile, blistering China IPO stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) suffered double-digit declines Thursday.Dropbox stock closed below its buy point Friday, a big red flag. Zscaler and Carbon Black also undercut entry areas intraday. IQiyi and Huya continued to swing wildly, but still have most of their gains.Should you hold or cash out of these volatile stocks? That depends on your investing horizon and your conviction in these names. But you should have a plan. Here are investing guidelines to consider:If a top stock rises more than 10% from the buy point, you really don't want to see that double-digit gain turn into a loss.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox blasted 24.5% from a 34.93 buy point, but has tumbled all the way to 35.69, losing 4.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Zscaler ran up 26% from its entry, also 34.93, but has since retreated to 35.21, diving 7.1% on Wednesday. Carbon Black vaulted 35% from a 25.94 entry. But it fell 26.67, off 7.5% on Thursday.On Friday, Dropbox sank 5.5% to 33.72, round-tripping its run. Zscaler fell to 34.25 intraday, round-tripping its run-up, though it did rebound to close up 4% at 36.63  Carbon Black sank 2% to 26.14 after falling as low as 25.69, just below its 25.94 entry.If a stock pulls back to a breakout area, does it find support at its buy point? Dropbox stock didn't seem to find support at the buy point. Zscaler stock did find support around its buy point, ultimately. So, to a lesser extent, did fellow security software IPO stock Carbon Black.While IPO stocks Dropbox, Zscaler and Carbon Black have fallen sharply, those sell-offs have come in volume that, though heavy, was generally lighter than on the run-up.Do you think this stock and company are going to be big long-term winners? Perhaps you let the stock pull back further. If it's a more speculative, short-term trade, you might be quicker to take partial or total profits.That's a question not only for the software IPO trio, but the Chinese livestreaming IPO duo of iQiyi and Huya.IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, tumbled 12% on Thursday. Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock sank 5.7% after plunging 9% earlier.Whatever your investing strategy, have a plan. How far are you willing to let a stock fall before you act? When a serious pullback occurs, follow your coolheaded strategy and not your emotions.Remember, if a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, that's an absolute sell signal.If a stock falls and you sell, you can always get back in when a new buying opportunity appears.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesWhy These Explosive China Stocks Are Due For PullbacksIf You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 5 Biotech IPOs Jump In Debuts

843,A,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has set a date to consider a new rule that would speed the process of bringing an ETF to market.On Thursday, the SEC will discuss whether to propose regulations that would allow asset managers to sell certain types of exchange traded funds without first gaining its approval, according to the commission's agenda. Under current rules, wannabe ETF issuers must get SEC permission — a process known as exemptive relief — before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.It's wonky stuff, but the new regulation has the potential to significantly shake up the $3.6 trillion U.S. ETF market. Currently, the industry's 80-plus issuers all operate under different orders that have inadvertently given some firms a competitive advantage. ETF advocates have been lobbying the SEC to level the playing field for years. Regulation that would have done it was first killed more than a decade ago.The SEC's agenda says rule 6c-11 ""would permit exchange traded funds that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining an exemptive order from the commission."" Issuers want the regulator to go further and make it easier for managers to choose the securities they add to or subtract from their ETFs when they issue and redeem shares. Some early adopters like BlackRock (BLK) already have this flexibility, but newer entrants face greater restrictions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That halted a seven-day run to 370.83. Before Tuesday's decline, Tesla shares were up 27% since the company's annual shareholder meeting on June 5.Musk sent another email to employees on Monday morning about a small factory fire on Sunday night that halted production for several hours. He suggested that employees look out for negligence or sabotage. The Tesla paint shop at its Fremont, Calif., factory has had at least four fires since 2014, according to CNBC.Musk also sent a tweet aimed at short-sellers, on Sunday, giving them a warning. ""They have about three weeks before this short position explodes,"" Musk wrote.The tweet was in response to a question that referenced short sellers being concerned about Tesla's recent manufacturing expansion.The three-week time frame coincides with the end of the second quarter and would be about the time Tesla typically reports quarterly vehicle deliveries. A number above expectations could send shares soaring. That would be bad news for short-sellers, who make money when the stock falls.Musk is racing to double production of its critical Model 3 sedan to 5,000 cars a week. Short sellers are skeptical the company can achieve that.Tesla stock received a price target increase two weeks ago by a Wall Street analyst who believes gross margins for the automaker's Model 3 will improve as it scales to higher production, thus helping it achieve profitability.Also potentially creating tension on the stock Tuesday is the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on $250 billion worth of China goods. That's nearly double what China imports from the U.S. But Tesla could interrupt American business in China in other ways.Tesla is eager to significantly expand its business in China. China could pose penalties such as customs delays, tax audits and increased regulatory scrutiny if Trump delivers on his threat of bigger duties on Chinese trade.RELATED:Tesla Cutting 9% Of Staff As It Tries To Ramp Up Model 3 OutputTesla Stock Jumps As Elon Musk Once Again Presents Heady Expectations

845,A,"AT&T (T) can go ahead with its acquisition of Time Warner (TWX), a U.S. District Court judge said late Tuesday, in a ruling that ignited a wave of late trading in telecom and media stocks.U.S. District Judge Richard Leon made the ruling after U.S. stock markets closed on Tuesday. Leon set no conditions on the AT&T takeover.Despite the win, AT&T fell 1.8% to 33.74 in after-hours trades. Time Warner rose 4.7% to 100.70. One analyst said AT&T's slip may involve arbitrage related to the Time Warner transaction.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T argued that it needs Time Warner's assets to compete with Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in the entertainment business.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf the Justice Department were to appeal a ruling favorable to AT&T, that could be a problem for the telecom conglomerate. In that event, Time Warner would have the option of walking away from the deal or renegotiating terms with AT&T. The merger agreement expires on June 21.Leon late Tuesday said he wouldn't grant a stay if the government requested one.The ruling in the landmark antitrust case sent shares in Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) down as investors now anticipate a bidding war over 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Fox rose 4.8% to 42.50, while Comcast fell 3.6% to 31.25. Shares in Disney were down 1.9% to 102.34.Judge Leon's ruling is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom companies that distribute content over broadband and wireless networks.Comcast could launch an all-cash bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox as soon as Wednesday. Disney in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has reportedly arranged financing for an all-cash bid. The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox. Comcast has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.The court ruling sent other media stocks up in late trades. CBS (CBS) rose 1.8% to 53.35.

846,A,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a ""Plan B"" that Harley employed after the U.S. abandoned the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year. He'd said they didn't relish the investment, which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market.The early-morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker, after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump's penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said.Harley shares fell 1.3% in early trading Tuesday in New York after tumbling 6% Monday, the biggest drop in almost five months. The stock is down 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!""In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years through bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump's ""trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.""""The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,"" Sanders told reporters at the White House.Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman (BFB), which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25% tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel's, would amount to about a 10% increase for consumers.Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that ""we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.""Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.The EU's levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump's trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as ""a true American icon"" and ""one of the greats.""""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,"" Trump said at the time. ""I think you're going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.""Harley-Davidson's headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump's move to impose tariffs, said the company's announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president's trade policy.""This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,"" AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. ""The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.""Lawmakers weighed in Tuesday on Trump's latest tweets.""What I'm worried about is that it's just the first of many that we are going to see as a result of tariffs,"" Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told CNN in an interview to discuss Harley's announcement that it would move some production abroad.""I don't know all the details but from what I saw was it would be a $2,200 increase on the final price per bike with these tariffs,"" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told CNN in a separate interview. ""That's going to impact sales.""""I don't have a problem with the president taking on China,"" Kinzinger added. ""But when you also take on Canada and Mexico and Europe at the same time I feel it's like it's trying to toss grenades everywhere.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Is Donald Trump About To Blink In China Trade War?IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

851,A,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has set a date to consider a new rule that would speed the process of bringing an ETF to market.On Thursday, the SEC will discuss whether to propose regulations that would allow asset managers to sell certain types of exchange traded funds without first gaining its approval, according to the commission's agenda. Under current rules, wannabe ETF issuers must get SEC permission — a process known as exemptive relief — before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.It's wonky stuff, but the new regulation has the potential to significantly shake up the $3.6 trillion U.S. ETF market. Currently, the industry's 80-plus issuers all operate under different orders that have inadvertently given some firms a competitive advantage. ETF advocates have been lobbying the SEC to level the playing field for years. Regulation that would have done it was first killed more than a decade ago.The SEC's agenda says rule 6c-11 ""would permit exchange traded funds that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining an exemptive order from the commission."" Issuers want the regulator to go further and make it easier for managers to choose the securities they add to or subtract from their ETFs when they issue and redeem shares.

852,A,"The U.S.-China trade war started with the Trump administration accusing China of unfair practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property. But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways. President Donald Trump has threatened to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies.That could cut off investment capital being used to fund such things as electric and self-driving vehicles.

854,A,"In the battle for investment survival, you can learn a lot from judo. The first and most important lesson in that martial art is the same for the stock market: damage control.Judo masters begin not by learning how to throw, but how to fall. They practice this skill until it's as natural as breathing. No matter how many times they're flipped, they can rise to fight again.Highly successful stock pickers go through similar training: They must learn how to cut their losses short. This means selling a stock when it's down 7% or 8% from your purchase price.Sounds simple, but many investors have learned the hard way how difficult it is to master the most important rule in investing.No one wants to sell for a loss. It's an admission that you made a mistake. But if you can set your ego aside, you can take a small loss and still be fit enough, both financially and mentally, to invest the next day. Cutting losses quickly prevents you from suffering a devastating fall that's too steep to recover from.Consider the math. Say you buy a stock at 50. For whatever reason, it drops 8% to 46 during the next few days. You promptly unload it and move on. To reclaim that loss, you need to make an 8.7% gain on your next purchase with your remaining capital, which shouldn't be hard to do.What if you hold on?You're sure the stock will snap back. Your research convinces you it's worth $100, so why get scared by a minor setback?There's one problem. The market doesn't care who you are, what you think or how much you believe in a stock. It says you miscalculated, at least in the short term — a message that gets louder as the stock drops 25% to 37-1/2. To get back even, now you need a 33% gain, which is much tougher to come by than that easy 8.7%.What if the market really doesn't like your stock and slices it in half to 25? You don't need a calculator for this one: To recover a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. How many stocks did you pick last year that doubled in price?If you limit losses on initial purchases to 7% or 8%, you can stay out of trouble, even if only 1 out of 4 buys delivers a modest profit of 25% or 30%. You can be wrong 3 out of every 4 times and still live to invest another day.A .250 batting average is nothing to crow about. But even the best hitters in baseball fail more than they succeed. Consider Tony Gwynn, who in 1999 became the 21st member of pro baseball's 3,000-hit club. That year, the former San Diego Padres outfielder finished the season with a batting average of .338. That means he was coming up empty nearly 2 out of 3 times at the plate.You won't see Gwynn fret after grounding out. The same is true for successful investors. They calmly take a small loss and look for the next potential winner.So leave your emotions behind. Cutting losses with discipline will help keep your head clear when it's time to return to the market. A great paradox of investing is that the ripest buying opportunities occur just after bear markets — when the major stock averages have declined 20% or more.That's exactly when most investors who haven't cut their losses are reeling and don't want to be hit again. It's hard to think straight after losing thousands of dollars. But the market always recovers. What kind of shape will you be in?(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Aug. 23, 1999, edition of IBD. Gwynn's last season was in 2001. His career batting average held at .338, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

861,A,"After a wave of mergers, the airline industry's consolidation appears to have slowed the trend of rising capacity and damaging fare wars. Even once-skeptical investors like Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett see the advantages that U.S. carriers now enjoy and have taken large positions in Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).But challenges to the sector remain, including the aggressive expansion of low-cost competitors and the proliferation of cheap flights in the lucrative trans-Atlantic market. There have also been some signs that airlines' discipline on holding capacity in check is eroding.View More Retail Stocks Industry NewsGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And Watch

862,A,"On the Fourth of July, our nation comes together to celebrate the Declaration of Independence and the first chapter in a two-and-a-half century American journey.To others, the holiday also marks the creation of another U.S. institution, the national debt, the significance of which is wrapped in layers of subtle irony for accountants that know their history.In 1776, representatives from 13 colonies took the bold step of declaring their independence from the world's foremost superpower.The colonists' principal concerns were financial: Great Britain's aggressive levies on everything from postage stamps to caffeinated tea appeared to be taxation without any correlating government services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFrom England's perspective, the taxes helped offset the costs — both human and capital — spent battling the French and Indian War. Both sides would have agreed that the colonists' lack of political representation gave them little input into tax policy.Eight years of revolutionary warfare followed, which brought additional debts to the colonies and the British Empire.By the time peace treaties were inked in 1783, the United States had spent an estimated $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level, much of it borrowed from nations overseas.The Congressional Research Service has pegged the inflation adjusted number at $2.4 billion.  (For comparison, that would have funded just one week's worth of operations in the Iraq War at 2008 troop levels.)The Revolutionary War bills were modest by modern standards, but substantial enough to present a heavy burden for a fledgling country with a population of just five million. Debate over the financial situation featured prominently in the Constitutional Convention unfolding in Philadelphia after the war.The ability to pay off the Revolution's debt ranged widely from state to state. Wealthy slave states like Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina quickly paid off their IOU's, while others struggled to make even installment payments.Alexander Hamilton boldly suggested that the federal government should adopt all war debt from the states. The notion enraged wealthier state governments, but obviously appealed to the others.In the era before income taxes, import tariffs represented the chief source of all government income. With the adoption of the Constitution, tariff income shifted from state to federal balance books, and Hamilton argued that the debt should follow the income.This arrangement would also knit the country together and give state governments a stake in the success of the union.Hamilton's suggestion was ultimately adopted, and the United States recorded its first national debt. Unlike in the modern day, 18th-century lawmakers saw borrowing money from foreign governments as a benefit, rather than a problem.Writing to Pennsylvania financier Robert Morris, Hamilton noted that ""a national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing; it will be powerful cement of our union.""In addition to strengthening the connection between state and federal governments, regular debt payments would establish a credit history for the nation. Hamilton promised that foreign investment capital would come flowing as a result.He also thought the debt ""a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which without being oppressive, will be a spur to industry.""From a modern vantage point, we can see that Hamilton was correct about the foreign investments that come with an established credit history.However, while the national debt may have acted as the ""powerful cement of our union"" in Hamilton's day, it did not keep taxes from becoming oppressive.And as the National Debt has increased to such astronomical levels in the last century, it effectively has become a cement block around the ankles of American taxpayers.We've added monumental sums to the national debt after extraordinary events like Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Even larger amounts of debt have been slowly added on year after year, for decades, to finance routine government programs, as well as Social Security and Medicare benefits.This alarming increase in spending and promising, along with less transparency into how we spend our tax dollars, cooks the national debt like the proverbial frog in a pot of water.The debt will burden future taxpayers, many of whom are currently not old enough to vote. Our founding fathers fought the revolutionary war because of taxation without representation.This Fourth of July is a time to reflect on our Declaration of Independence, but also an opportunity to examine the origins of our national debt and how it has changed over the centuries.Oppressive taxation drove a patriotic class of budding statesmen to set out on their own and reimagine their government's relationship with the people it represents. Alexander Hamilton's saw modest borrowing as a tool to revitalize the economy and demonstrate creditworthiness.The founders would be horrified at our government's current, reported national debt of more than $20 trillion — not to mention the additional $80 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare promises not included in that figure.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

871,A,"I'm tired.Done in by network and cable news alike.Fried from frequenting online publications and opinion sites.Pooped in perusing breathless alerts on my devices.I've had it. And I'm not alone.A Pew Research study recently found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans suffer from ""news fatigue"" — a phenomenon even more pervasive among Republicans. The survey focused on the volume as much as the quality of the offerings.But why wouldn't the public be emotionally expended from the anger and accusations, bullying and backbiting, ""fake news"" and ""fact checks,"" insults and innuendo, posturing and protests, threats and trolling, and virtue-signaling and violent rhetoric and imagery spewed from every direction today?The truth is that an endless assault on our senses and sensibilities via the media has been a feature, not a bug, of political discourse for some time now.And my educated guess is that the reason news fatigue affects one party more is that for most of that time, one side — progressives, abetted by allies in the media — has dominated this ""perpetual outrage cycle"" to wear down opposition to once-radical ideas and erode adherence to traditional American values.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn fact, as I once observed (presciently, if I do say so myself) in the same-sex marriage context, the whole idea of the left's unabated and uninhibited assault is not to win debates. It's to extend them ad infinitum, ad absurdum and ad nauseam, alongside extortion and intimidation — until opponents lose their grip on certainty and collapse in confusion, exhaustion and disarray.It may seem that the objective in this unyielding, any-means-to-an-end onslaught is the triumph of liberal ideas. But it's really power. Progressives recognize that by deploying rage to sow social and economic chaos, they open the door for Big Government ""solutions.""Shrill put-downs of traditional sexual mores and family structures — and eternal insistence on free birth control and unregulated abortion — spawn single-parent families trapped in poverty and lacking health care. Hence extended welfare programs, expanded Medicaid and that ultimate power grab, ObamaCare. (It's no coincidence that single females frothed into perpetual frenzy over these ""women's issues"" — think ""pussyhats"" — are among the most reliable Democratic voters and the leading edge of ""Le Resistance."")Perpetration of school massacres and the transformation of inner cities into war zones by the resulting fatherless youth leads to pressure for tightened gun laws — featuring high-schoolers openly dissing elected officials on national television and in viral videos.Surrender of control of our borders — demanded by shrieking mobs waving foreign flags and scaling walls for the cameras — drives calls for even further liberalized immigration laws to accommodate children (read: future Democratic voters) smuggled here illegally. Unsurprisingly, the latest extended liberal hissy fit is over youngsters separated from parents who deliberately flaunted the law.Even worker bonuses handed out in response to the recent tax cut bill — which returns money and power to the people from Washington — prompted faux liberal fury.Not to mention high-minded sowing of gender confusion, protests over ""cultural appropriation,"" campus riots, and portrayals of ""wrong"" thinkers as heartless, bigots, racists, chauvinists, defenders of ""patriarchy"" and increasingly, as murderers. All intended to pound the ""Silent Majority"" into lethargy, lassitude and ultimately, capitulation and conformance.Admittedly, none of this is new news. So what's making my media consumption that much more exhausting these days? The adoption of these same tactics by a leader supposedly representing the opposite flank: a modern media virtuoso continually on the attack and keeping the other side — and often his own — off-kilter and out-of-sorts with a steady stream of slights, slurs, abuse and affronts to ""norms.""While it may be welcome in some quarters, to many of us on the right, the ascension of the first ""shock jock"" president is yet another jolt to already jangled nerves. And making it worse is that this ""conservative"" chief executive's triumph in occupying the progressives' rhetorical space has forced some further to the oratorical fringes — and sadly, over the edge.Hence Robert DeNiro's bleeped, out-of-context reference to the commander in chief. Samantha Bee's uncensored description of the first daughter employing decidedly unfeminist terminology. Michelle Wolf's sick White House Correspondents' Dinner monologue. Even appalling public utterances of the Raging Bull's phraseology of choice by Democratic Party leaders and elected officials. All mind-numbingly defended as a necessary response to Trump and Trumpism.I wish someone could stand athwart this downward definition of deviant speech and shut down the ugliness. But as with negative political advertising, it works: for progressives in achieving nearly all of their political and social aspirations — and for Donald Trump in seizing near-complete command of the media cycle.The only ones it doesn't seem to be working for are those 7 in 10 ""news-fatigued"" Americans — and me.So my suggestion?

The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts.

880,A,"For many advisors, prospecting is the lifeblood of their business. Whether they're just starting out or decades into their career, they routinely ask clients for referrals.Through email reminders or direct requests, these advisors often emphasize that the best compliment a client can give them involves referring friends or family to sign on. It's standard practice — and clients are accustomed to such entreaties.To cast a wider net, enterprising advisors raise their profile in the community. They may lead public seminars on financial topics, write a column for the local newspaper or appear on radio shows as a money expert.Through their outreach, advisors seek to attract prospects in need of financial advice. The more interested parties who call for introductory appointments, the more people these advisors can convert to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut some advisors blaze a different path. Rather than succeed by following the conventional playbook, they adopt unusual prospecting strategies.""I rarely ask for referrals,"" said James Hegland, an advisor in Rochester, Minn. ""Yet I get them all the time, and I don't do any advertising.""Instead, Hegland is a prodigious sender of friendly letters. He jots handwritten notes to a wide range of acquaintances, including clients, which convey admiration, support or other positive sentiments.""I'm always looking for people doing great things or attempting to do great things,"" Hegland said. ""Then I write encouraging or complimentary things to them.""Hegland keeps his letters short and sweet. And he never raises business matters or even hints that he'd like the recipient to refer others to his firm.Warmly personal notes can resonate with readers. Because writing letters is becoming less common, they stand out more.For example, Hegland wrote a congratulatory message to a client's young son who became an Eagle Scout. A few days later, the client called and told Hegland, ""This is one of the most meaningful notes my son has received.""Within weeks, Hegland gained a new client as word spread of his kind act. He says this often happens because recipients — and their families — tell others.Hegland began sending handwritten notes on a more regular basis in 2012. He estimates that he has mailed over 700 letters each year since then.When he chats with clients and others, he might inquire about their family or show interest in other aspects of their life. Their responses often trigger a follow-up note.If a client mentions that he recently took a long hike with his children, Hegland will promptly jot a note, ""I'm so proud of you for hiking five miles with your kids."" It not only shows that he listened, but also that he likes what he heard or finds it inspiring.He adds a few eye-catching touches to his letters. For starters, he writes ""personal"" on the lower corner of the envelope. He also uses stationery — and even stamps — with splashes of orange to add a distinctive flourish.""I'm very particular about all of this,"" Hegland said. ""And I never enclose a business card or anything else"" with the letter.For some advisors, prospecting and socializing go hand-in-hand. Hosting festive gatherings for clients and other guests leaves a lasting positive impression, which in turn can generate leads.Megan Jones, an advisor with AE Wealth Management in Topeka, Kan., throws an annual birthday party for all clients who turn 70-½ during the year — to celebrate the age they start taking required minimum distributions from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts. They bring their children and grandchildren and enjoy cake and refreshments.""We give them a funny cone hat to wear when they come in,"" Jones said. ""We had someone post a Facebook photo of her husband wearing the hat. Others saw it, including someone who contacted us and became a client.""To attract prospects to her firm, Jones also leads monthly ""lunch and learn"" programs in her office's conference room. Along with guest speakers, she covers a range of educational topics including estate planning, tax reform and market updates.For many advisory firms, local engagement doubles as a prospecting tool. By banding together to volunteer on a project, from providing services to the homeless to sponsoring a road race that raises funds for a nonprofit organization, advisors build their visibility while giving back to the community.At its core, prospecting flows from strong client relationships. By maintaining strong connections with clients on an ongoing basis — through periodic calls, emails and other communication — advisors reinforce their value. This in turn triggers referrals, as clients are more likely to share their positive experience with others.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Attentive Advisors Create A Comfortable Space For Clients To ShareWhen Clients Acquire Vast Wealth, Advisors Are A Priceless ResourceIf You're Going To A Conference, Get The Most Out Of Every Minute

882,A,"Progressives: The shocking primary victory of 28-year-old socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over Congress' No. 4, Democrat Joe Crowley, underscores what we have long noted: The Democratic Party is no longer a party of moderation, but a party of the extreme left. And it's moving ever faster and farther leftward with each election cycle.The 57%-42% drubbing of Crowley looks like the death knell not just for his political career, but for that of his mentor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Crowley, after all, was the hand-picked successor to Pelosi. He had outraised his far younger opponent by 10-to-1.Ocasio-Cortez isn't a make-believe socialist; she belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America. And she had the backing of Bernie Sanders' ""Our Revolution"" political group.""Our Revolution""? Do they want a civil war? It's a real concern. A new Rasmussen poll shows 31% of Americans think a civil war is likely soon, while 59% fear violence from Trump haters. That's scary.And, by the way, Ocasio-Cortez is no fluke. She's part of a trend. Just look at who the leading lights of the Democrats are today. In addition to such progressive stalwarts as Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, their most vocal and visible leaders include far-left Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.The House has so many far-left Democrats we couldn't list them all in an editorial. But they are numerous, and angry, pushing their side ever closer to violent confrontation.Take Rep. Maxine Waters, an influential Democrat who had this to say about civility toward the political opposition: ""If you see anybody from that (Trump) Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""As the violent rhetoric ramps up, Trump officials (Sarah Huckabee, Elaine Chao, Jeff Sessions, among others) have been harassed in public places and at their homes, threatened with violence and even thrown out of restaurants because they work for this White House. It shows what the left really thinks of democracy.Is this a preview of what America will be like under a Democratic administration?Is this the future of the Democratic Party? Sure looks that way.The party's base is itself increasingly far left. As a study last year by the American Culture and Faith Institute of adults 18 and older showed, 37% of adults said they ""prefer socialism to capitalism."" Most of those were self-described liberals.""That is a large minority,"" wrote researcher and Executive Director George Barna. ""And it includes a majority of the liberals — who will be pushing for a completely different economic model to dominate our nation. That is the stuff of civil wars. It ought to set off alarm bells among more traditionally-oriented leaders across the nation.""They already are pushing for a ""different model.""In addition to embracing violence and the denial of such basic constitutional rights as free speech, freedom of religion and the right to protect oneself, much of the Democratic Party now embraces a spate of far-left ideas. These include such winners as open borders, Medicare for all (single-payer health care), unrestricted abortion, special ""gender"" rights, free tuition, government controlled housing, deep and dangerous defense cuts, a job-killing $15-an-hour minimum wage, a ""guaranteed income"" for all, and ever-higher welfare spending.Meanwhile, the party's socialist-progressive wing, which now dominates, love-hugs all these ideas. And it's actively anti-capitalist.Parts of this agenda of unbridled socialism show up in Democrats' official new policy blueprint called ""A Better Deal."" A better name would be ""A Rawer Deal,"" because these ideas have been tried before and failed. As we've noted here repeatedly, there are no successful socialist countries. None. It's an unworkable, inhuman system that replaces individual rights and freedom with authoritarian control imposed from above, all in the name of ""the people.""Americans have had their economic knowledge systematically dumbed-down by the media and the schools, from elementary school through university. Ask younger people whether they like socialism, and a majority now say yes. They've been trained to hate capitalism, and never lived under socialism. So they don't know it's the death of all they hold dear and the end to their individual dreams.In addition, socialism is antithetical to democracy. A study in 2015 by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and University of Chicago economist James A. Robinson suggests that democratic systems are the only way to thrive as an economy. ""Our central estimates suggest that a country that switches from autocracy to democracy achieves about 20% higher GDP per capita over roughly 30 years.""It's shocking because there are so many examples of socialism's failures today — from Zimbabwe and North Korea to Cuba and Venezuela. No socialist nation thrives. Ever.

When Google changed its corporate name to Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015, it changed the slogan to ""Do the right thing.""If it were to be true to its values, Google should have changed its slogan from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Don't fight evil.""Here is The New York Times report from this past Friday:""Google, hoping to head off a rebellion by employees upset that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes, will not renew a contract with the Pentagon for artificial intelligence work ...""Google's work with the Defense Department on the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, roiled the internet giant's work force. Many of the company's top A.I. researchers, in particular, worried that the contract was the first step toward using the nascent technology in advanced weapons. ...""About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding 'a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.'""CBS News reported that the petition also said, ""We believe that Google should not be in the business of war.""In other words, to the heads of Google and thousands of its elite employees, it is immoral to aid in the defense of their country, and all war is immoral.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoogle and these 4,000 employees embody two terrible traits: moral idiocy and ingratitude.Moral idiocy is the ability to be brilliant in any area of life except the single most important area of life, morality. With regard to morality, such people are fools.The United States has been the greatest force for liberty and goodness in world history. It has been so by modeling a free society and through the power of the idea of freedom, and even more so by force — brute physical force.Through force of arms, America and its allies defeated Germany in World War I and World War II.Through force of arms, America imposed democracy and liberty on West Germany and led to the dissolution of East Germany.Through force of arms, the Holocaust — the genocide of Europe's Jews and millions of others in Nazi concentration and death camps — ended. If Google existed then, would its employees have demanded Google ""not be in the business of war""?Through force of arms, America was able to impose democracy and liberty on Japan.Through force of arms, America liberated Asian countries from the Nazi-like Japanese imperialists.Through force of arms, America enabled the majority of Koreans to live free rather than under the most totalitarian regime in modern history, North Korea.Through force of arms, Israel has survived 70 years of Arab, and now Iranian, attempts to annihilate it. Arms ended the Holocaust in Europe, and arms prevent a second Holocaust of Jews in the Middle East.Only a moral idiot does not understand the moral necessity of weapons of war being in the hands of decent countries.Which brings us to the second trait of Google and its employees: ingratitude.Google and its employees live better than almost any human beings in the world. They do so because they live in the freest and most opportunity-giving country in the world, the United States of America.That Google and its employees refuse to work on the military defense of their country is an expression of ingratitude (not to mention absence of patriotism) that is simply breathtaking.How did we produce such foolish and ungrateful people?They are the products of left-wing education and the left-wing media, and of living in the left-wing cocoon of Northern California and its tech industry.Google should be true to its convictions and change just one word of its original slogan from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Don't fight evil.""

That 2.12 million figure was up 9% on April 3, 2017, following last year's ""WrestleMania.""And in May the firm forecast a ""meaningful increase"" in second-quarter sales due to new content distributed internationally.WWE has successfully undertaken a move from its wrestling roots to movies, publishing, music, online streaming and various other business ventures.

896,A,"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) stock exploded Wednesday after pinning down bigger-than-expected deals with 21st Century Fox (FOX) and Comcast (CMCSA) to broadcast its shows.The leading name in sports entertainment announced the closing of a five-year deal late Tuesday that will see ""SmackDown Live"" debut on Fox on Oct. 19, 2019. The two-hour live show will air on Fridays every week on a year-round schedule.It also announced that Comcast's USA Network will continue to air the flagship ""Raw"" show for another five years. The channel had contractual first right of refusal on both programs, but opted to concentrate its resources in securing the more popular, at least at the moment, show.WWE said the agreements increase the average annual value of its U.S. distribution to 3.6 times that of the prior deal with Comcast's NBC Universal arm.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe deals form a core part of what the company calls its ""key content agreements,"" from which it made approximately $235 million in 2018. WWE forecasts that this figure will increase to $314 million in 2019 and $542 million in 2021 with Fox and Comcast. The firm is hoping to have completed new deals in the U.K. by year-end 2018; and in India during the first half of 2019.""WWE and Fox are a perfect match. Moving 'SmackDown Live' to broadcast TV and having the ability to leverage Fox's extensive portfolio of world-class sporting events will expand the reach of our flagship programming,"" CEO Vince McMahon said in a news release.He also hailed the Comcast deal, saying his ""Raw"" brand is ""synonymous with USA Network and we are excited about what the future holds for WWE's flagship program.""WWE shares jumped 6.35% to close at a fresh record high of 70.85 on the stock market today, after soaring by 12% in premarket trading. Fox stock rose 2.35%, while Comcast fell 1.5%.WWE stock has a group-leading IBD Composite Rating of 95, and broke into the top-10% club in April. Its Relative Strength Rating is even more impressive, a best-possible 99. Earnings growth has been improving in recent quarters, but consistent growth has been hard to pin down.MKM Partners managing director Eric Handler said the lucrative deal was a ""giant step up for WWE.""""Based on a $2.3bn overall value and what appears to be ~6.5% annual escalators, we estimate there will be a 170% step-up in revenue for WWE in the first year of its new domestic contacts,"" Handler said in a research note. ""This step-up should produce revenue in Year 1 (4Q19-3Q20) of approximately $400mn, up 170% from $150mn in the last year of the prior contract.""While Handler is holding a 68 price target for now, he said a valuation move towards 100 per share following adjustments is beginning to look ""very reasonable.""KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren also said the new TV rights came in above revised expectations. He also believes there is still more potential upside from the stock.""With successful renewals in the United States under its belt, and likely more to come, we believe WWE is in the process of being re-rated to reflect the dramatic changes of its brand and profitability profile,"" Wingren said in a research note. ""The terminal implications imply that with execution, WWE has the potential to invest and set itself up for even more lucrative TV renewals and accelerate international (internet media) growth.""The move to network TV with Fox will be exciting news for fans of the ""sport,"" in which oiled, muscle-bound men, and some women, parade around in tight outfits and pretend to fight each other.""SmackDown Live"" is the second-longest running weekly episodic cable TV show in U.S. prime-time history. It is second only to stablemate ""Monday Night Raw,"" which has aired over 1,300 episodes to date.Subscriptions have also increased for WWE's digital streaming service. This is a big part of the company's move to stay relevant to cord-cutters.Back in April, the company said subscriptions to WWE Network hit a record 2.12 million subscribers following April 8's ""WrestleMania,"" the event that often marks the annual boiling point for WWE's drama. That 2.12 million figure was up 9% on April 3, 2017, following last year's ""WrestleMania.""And in May the firm forecast a ""meaningful increase"" in second-quarter sales due to new content distributed internationally.WWE has successfully undertaken a move from its wrestling roots to movies, publishing, music, online streaming and various other business ventures. Its film company helped launch the career of Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson, who first shot to fame under his wrestling moniker of ""The Rock.""

898,A,"Annie Turnbo Malone became a millionaire early in the 20th century, when a million bucks still meant something.And she did it the hard way: as a black woman without formal education. Against all odds, she combined an innate skill in caring for hair with an unquenchable desire to succeed to create a national beauty care product company. In the process, she gave jobs to thousands of African-American women who sold her products door to door like early-day Avon Ladies and even started a college for women that taught skills for success.Her unlikely journey began in Metropolis, Ill. Annie Turnbo (1869-1957) was the 10th of 11 children born to former slaves. Her parents died when she was still a toddler, so Turnbo was sent to live with an older sister in Peoria.Shomari Wills, author of ""Black Fortunes: The Story of the First Six African Americans who Escaped Slavery and Became Millionaires,"" noted: ""She was very smart. She looked around and saw her options were (limited): become a sharecropper or a domestic servant, and she certainly didn't want what she saw as a very hard life without money. But she knew she had a skill.""From a very young age, Turnbo had a penchant for working on women's hair, braiding and combing often difficult-to-manage locks. Her sisters and their friends happily let Annie work on their tresses, but also warned her not to vest too much in her foolish notions of starting her own hair care business, as necessary as it might have been.As Wills wrote, ""There was no defined black aesthetic"" for hair care in the years following the Emancipation Proclamation."" Women often braided their hair in an African style or covered their heads with scarves or bonnets. Some used harmful lye or bear grease in a misguided attempt ""to look more like white people.""Added Adia Harvey Wingfield, professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""Doing Business with Beauty: Black Women, Hair Salons, and the Racial Enclave Economy"": ""Around this time, black women often considered their hair unattractive and unmanageable. Particularly in the post-slavery era, women had to work outside the home and they tried to improve their appearance to more conform to white society and be more acceptable to white employees. They'd receive ads for hair straightening products from white-owned companies that damaged their hair.""Though not in school, Turnbo continued to read about the latest advances in chemistry, which had been her favorite subject. One day, she read an article about an ointment that dairy farmers used to treat the skin of cows' udders. She purchased some from a local drugstore, mixed in natural ingredients from an herbalist to add a fresh, attractive aroma and created a formula that regrew hair in bald patches left by snake oil concoctions women had used in the past.She went door to door and stopped by as black churches let out Sunday mornings. Success didn't come immediately. The locals were skeptical. But slowly word spread that this product — she continued modifying and improving it — worked. She called it, appropriately, Wonderful Hair Grower. It eventually outgrew the small-town market.She moved to St. Louis, anticipating large crowds for the 1903 World Fair. By this time, she'd already expanded her line of hair care and beauty products for black women, including face powders, cleansing cream and shampoos.As she'd done back in Illinois, she hired and trained women to sell her products. She had to. Because she was black, normal distribution and sales channels were closed to her. But here the World's Fair proved a major boon to her business. It attracted African-Americans from around the country and the Caribbean. They were tourists who were not only potential customers, but also potential salespeople.She visited the fair as often as she could, pitching the idea every chance she had. In relatively short order, she built a national sales network.Around 1906, she named the company Poro. There is some question about how she came up with that. One theory is that it likely was named after a West African secret male society dedicated to discipline and enhancing the body physically and spiritually. Another was that she selected it just because it sounded African. In either case, it became clear that she wanted to connect her sales agents with their African roots.For Malone, it wasn't just about money. She believed if African-American women improved their appearance, it would enhance their self-respect and improve their ability to achieve success in all aspects of their lives.""The thing that struck me most about her is not only that she worked for her own success, but that it was important for her to help other African-American women succeed on their own,"" noted George T. Haley, professor of marketing and quantitative analysis at the University of New Haven's College of Business.""She wanted them to be independent, earn a decent wage and have a decent life. She recognized a salesperson's appearance (and the way she spoke) was a key to her success. It was something she learned on her own, and she made it part of the training for her sales force.""She was right. It was during this period that Jim Crow replaced Reconstruction laws. Black shoppers were excluded from white-owned stores and white institutions. The result was the creation of a sizable black economy stimulated by black-owned businesses.Turnbo not only rode this wave — at its height the company's sales amounted to almost $37 million in today's dollars and employed 75,000 women around the world — but she fueled it as well.  (One benefactor was Madam C.J. Walker, who worked for Turnbo and borrowed her formulas to found her own beauty company.)Turnbo, who married Eugene Malone (a former teacher and religious book salesman), extended the brand by franchising beauty salons around the country. She assured a continued supply of qualified beauticians and salespeople by starting Poro College in 1918. Given her interest in promoting a better life for black women, the school's curriculum went far beyond hairstyling and sales techniques. It included also courses on etiquette: how to walk, talk and dress — all this to prepare women for the workplace.Turnbo was the first black female millionaire and a strong believer in giving back. An important philanthropist, she donated substantial sums to Howard University School of Medicine and the St. Louis Colored Orphans Home (now the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center), among other charities.Used her natural gifts and unbridled determination to build a multimillion-dollar beauty care empire.Overcame: Deep-seated prejudice and a Jim Crow society.Lesson: If you have a good product and a dedicated sales force, you can overcome a lot.Quote: ""Would you like a job selling the Wonderful Hair Grower?"" she asked satisfied customers again and again.

901,A,"Just as President Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on imported autos and threatening to exit Nafta, General Motors (GM) plans to resurrect the Chevrolet Blazer, this time as a sleeker sport utility vehicle — made in Mexico.The new mid-size SUV model — bigger than the Equinox, smaller than the Traverse — will go on sale early next year. GM is reviving a nameplate that went away in 1994 when the boxy, truck-like SUV was renamed the Tahoe. The largest U.S. automaker will assemble the car-based utility at its plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico.The choice of locale could be contentious. Trump has been pressuring automakers to create more jobs in the U.S. and threatened to tear up Nafta and may be preparing to slap a 25% tariff on all imported autos in order to bring back assembly work lost to Mexico and elsewhere. GM's decision was sharply criticized by the United Auto Workers union, which supported Trump's investigation into vehicle imports.""This news that the iconic Blazer nameplate will be built in Mexico is disappointing to UAW families and communities across this country,"" Terry Dittes, vice president of the UAW's GM Department, said in a statement. ""This is all happening while UAW-GM workers here in the U.S are laid off and unemployed.""The president has appealed to working-class voters in part by bemoaning the loss of factory work in the U.S. and blaming unfair trade with other countries.""After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!"" Trump wrote on Twitter in May, before directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether imported cars pose a national security threat. Trump also told top auto industry executives last month in a White House meeting that he wants them to build more vehicles in the U.S.The UAW said GM employs more than 15,000 production workers in Mexico and pays them $3 an hour. The union claims that GM sells more than 80% of its Mexico-made vehicles to the U.S. In April, GM cut the second shift at an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where it makes the slow-selling Chevy Cruze compact car. Chevrolet is expected to import about 780,000 vehicles this year, mostly from Mexico, according to LMC Automotive.GM chose to make the Blazer in Mexico because the company was planning the vehicle years ago, when all of its SUV plants were running on three shifts, spokeswoman Katie Amann said. The Ramos Arizpe factory was the only assembly plant with enough capacity for the Blazer, she said by phone.The Blazer probably will find eager buyers, said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at auto market researcher Edmunds.""Car buyers love the return of a familiar name, and Chevrolet is picking an ideal time to bring back the Blazer,"" Acevedo said in an email. ""A four-door Blazer is square in line with what shoppers want and what Chevy was missing from its lineup.""GM stock rose 0.3% on the stock market today.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Why The Trump Trade War Will Rock Q2 Earnings SeasonDon't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade War

The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area.

AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA).

The deal also bodes well for big vertical health care mergers, including CVS Health (CVS) buying Aetna (AET).Comcast (CMSCA), as expected, launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company, a 19% premium over the Walt Disney (DIS) offer.

908,A,"There are 79 million baby boomers and every day 10,000 of them retire. Up until now, the asset management business has been focused on accumulation because that met the demographic trend. But now that trend is changing, and those people need to draw down and live off the assets they've spent their lives accumulating.A new exchange traded fund, Strategy Shares Nasdaq 7HANDL Index ETF (HNDL), presents itself as a solution to this problem. This ETF says it's the first designed to pay its investors a consistent monthly distribution. That distribution should equal 7% of the fund's net asset value by the end of the year.In an environment where interest rates are so low that people can't afford to live off the 1% or less they receive on savings accounts or CDs or the 2% to 3% that U.S. Treasuries pay, a 7% annual payout looks very attractive.""What's unique is the 7% target distribution,"" said David Miller, HNDL's portfolio manager. ""As opposed to just owning a diversified portfolio, investors wouldn't have to go to the effort to sell part of their holdings to generate what they would get from the distributions.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe distribution is not a dividend. It's a consistent payout that investors can rely on. All or part of the distribution may consist of a return of capital. That means if dividends, fixed income and capital gains don't fund the distribution, it may be funded by the capital investors pay in.""I think it's a unique and novel approach, particularly in a low-yield environment where people have trouble finding sources for distributions,"" said Corey Hoffstein, chief investment officer for Newfound Research, a Boston-based asset manager.In order to create a portfolio that gives both long-term growth and stability, the fund of funds holds other ETFs by tracking two indexes in a 50-50 ratio. The Nasdaq 7 HANDL Index is composed of the Dorsey Wright Explore Portfolio and the Core Portfolio.The Dorsey Wright Explore Portfolio is a tactical allocation index for high levels of current income. It holds the largest, most liquid and least expensive ETFs in 12 categories: growth & income equities, dividend equities, utility stocks, master limited partnerships (MLPs), preferred dividend stocks, real estate investment trusts (REIT), covered calls, active fixed income, high-yield bonds, intermediate-term corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and Build America Bonds (taxable muni).The Core Portfolio provides long-term exposure to the U.S. fixed-income and equity markets with allocations fixed at 70% bonds and 30% stocks. It holds the three least-expensive aggregate bond ETFs and large-cap blend equity ETFs, and the least expensive NASDAQ-100 Index ETF. Both indexes are rebalanced monthly.The fund manager employs leverage in an amount equal to 23% of the portfolio to boost the return. Closed-end funds have been using leverage for decades to manage large distributions. But unlike closed-end funds, the ETF doesn't have premium/discount volatility around its NAV.""From a risk-adjusted perspective, the best Sharpe ratio is 70-30,"" said David Cohen, co-founder of HANDLS (High-Distribution AND Liquid Solutions) Indexes. ""The Sharpe ratio measures return per unit of risk. The whole focus is to maximize risk-adjusted returns. To enhance performance if you (don't mind) a higher level of risk, you buy a diversified portfolio and increase your exposure rather than go into concentrated pools of assets to get income.""""We don't like to talk about the leverage part, because it upsets people,"" said Cohen, ""But leverage can be your friend. Take a low-risk portfolio and leverage it up to a level of risk you're interested in taking, and you have a better overall investment experience.""Such funds can be useful, says Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""I call them yield-seeking missiles. You just buy it and (it) goes out, gets yield and makes your life easier — and a 7% yield is really juicy,"" he said. ""However, it's pretty expensive, and there's another product that does something similar and pays close to the same yield.""HNDL charges a 0.95% expense ratio. First Trust Multi-Asset Diversified Income Index Fund (MDIV) holds 20% equities, 20% REITs, 20% preferred securities, 20% MLPs, and 20% high-yield corporate debt ETF. It doesn't guarantee its yield of about 6.7% and charges 0.70%.Other ETFs offer yields around 7% but don't guarantee their distribution rate and are usually concentrated in one asset class. PowerShares CEF Income Composite Portfolio (PCEF) holds closed-end funds and carries a 2.07% expense ratio. Global X Super Dividend ETF (SDIV) holds the highest-dividend-yielding equities in the world.

911,A,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%. Revenue had soared 317% in 2015, then rose another 58% and 32% the next two years.Expect double bottoms to proliferate among leading stocks when the major indexes fall furiously in several waves. Great market leaders built double bottoms and broke out after the bear markets in the fall of 1998, the fall of 2002, and other occasions.Sometimes you'll see a handle form on the double bottom. It's the market's way of presenting an additional buy point.(Sanofi completed its acquisition of Bioverativ on March 8. A version of this column was published on March 1, 2018. Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on the financial markets, growth companies, charts and stock breakouts.)RELATED:This Is The Golden Rule Of InvestingWhat Is The Current Stock Market Direction?

912,A,"AbbVie (ABBV) sank to a two-month low Friday after an analyst suggested that its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira could face increasing sales pressure from rival copycat drugs later this year.On the stock market today, AbbVie lost 2.2%, to close at 93.49. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 125.96. Stocks of pharmaceutical companies rose a fraction to wrap up the regular session.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that patents protect Humira sales in the U.S. until 2023. In Europe, though, AbbVie's arthritis treatment is expected to see biosimilar competition later this year. Biosimilars are nearly identical copies of biologic drugs.""With our estimates suggesting the biologic blockbuster Humira accounts for 60% of AbbVie's total (net present value), we remain cautious on AbbVie's outlook in front of Humira biosimilar competition,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's also likely AbbVie could see competition for its arthritis treatment in the U.S. prior to 2023, he said. He noted that AbbVie recently lowered its 2018 Humira sales guidance in the U.S. That cut represents additional pressure from insurers and less ability to raise prices in the U.S., he said.Divan reiterated his underperform rating on AbbVie. His comments followed a decision Thursday from the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw and reconfigure draft guidance for developing biosimilars.The decision is intriguing, he said.""Our interpretation of this development is that the FDA is learning (along with all of us) what is necessary in order to ensure safe and effective, but also cost effective and efficient, development of biosimilars in the United States,"" he said.Divan expects the FDA to issue updated guidance in the coming months. On Thursday, the FDA said it decided to withdraw the guidance based on public comments. It now plans to rework the guide for developing biosimilars with further consideration of scientific and regulatory issues.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted the potential for biosimilars to foster competition and lower the cost of biologic treatments. President Donald Trump has long argued for competition to help bring down the price of drugs for American consumers.""Yet the market for these products is not advancing as quickly as I hoped,"" Gottlieb said in a written statement. ""We're taking a fresh look at our draft recommendations for evaluating analytical studies in order to ensure our guidance takes into consideration the most current and relevant science.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

The contract is worth up to $14.3 billion.While a final decision has yet to be made by the Canadian government, tensions are high after the Trump administration pressed ahead with plans to slap tariffs on its aluminum and steel products. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and other products.Boeing was already facing problems after the NATO ally's government said bids will partially be evaluated by examining whether firms have caused any past economic damage to Canada.

922,A,"The breadth of industries that feature stocks hitting new highs continues to be wide. On Tuesday, Salesforce.com (CRM), Five Below (FIVE) and Dillard's (DDS) are giving investors opportunities to add new positions to their portfolios.Salesforce, a June 2004 IPO, is up more than 2% for the week as shares continue to drive past a 128.97 buy point in a seven-week cup pattern.The 5% buy zone extends up to 135.42. Thus, the stock remains in the permissible buy range.Notice on a daily chart how the RS line, painted in blue, continues to pump into new high ground. Good. It confirms that the enterprise software play is beating the S&P 500. Since its February 2017 breakout from a first-stage base at 80.47, Salesforce has rallied more than 65%.The San Francisco-based firm has emerged as a real force of change within its field. CEO Marc Benioff, who left Oracle (ORCL) to start Salesforce, pushed for a new business model in which customers could download customer relationship management (CRM) software straight from the internet onto their computers — with no stacks of CDs to upload into their desktops. Salesforce sought to make its products affordable and easy to use.Today, the company has excelled in going beyond the CRM space and into service, marketing, data analytics, collaboration and AI. It continues to win multiple large contracts.In its April-ended first quarter, Salesforce achieved another milestone. Revenue grew 25% to $3.01 billion, marking the first time it logged $3 billion in quarterly sales. Salesforce had a total $3.05 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year ended in January 2013.On a quarterly basis, revenue has grown 25%, 27%, 25%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 27%, 26%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past 10 periods.Five Below has cleared a 78.38 entry in a six-week flat base. The Philadelphia-based retail innovator, popular among kids who can spend their allowances on items priced at $5 or less, reports fiscal Q1 results after the close on Wednesday.The Street sees earnings up 120% to 33 cents a share on a 25% rise in sales to $291.4 million. That would mark the biggest year-over-year profit increase since a 175% leap in the quarter ended July 2013.Five Below joined IBD Leaderboard as an earnings-related call option play on Wednesday.Dillard's rose more than 5% and reached as high as 93.58 intraday. At that price, shares stood more than 5% past the 88.61 buy point in a 12-week cup. Disciplined buying means grabbing shares when they are no more than 5% past the proper entry.While on a daily chart Dillard's may have showed handle-type action from May 21 to June 1, such a handle is invisible on the weekly chart. Treat that shakeout period as more attempts by the stock to build the right side of the cup.Dillard's has posted big earnings growth in the past two quarters (up 52% to $2.82 a share and up 36% to $2.89 on an adjusted basis) as the Little Rock, Ark., company ended a nine-quarter drought in sales growth with top-line gains of 6% in fiscal Q4 and 3% in Q1. The Street sees sales inching up 1% to $1.47 billion in the July-ending second quarter.Dillard's joins Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as new emerging leaders within the retail sector. All three belong to IBD's Retail-Department Store industry group, which as of Monday's close ranked No. 23 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance.RELATED:Why iQiyi Hit A New High And Triggered A Sell Signal, But Not As A Climax Run The Latest Inside Investor's CornerWhy Even In a Bull Market, The 5% Rule Matters For Stock Investors

923,A,"Starbucks (SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz will leave the coffee chain later this month, bringing to a close a nearly four-decade run at the company that ushered coffeehouse culture into mainstream American life and carved out a global restaurant empire to rival McDonald's (MCD).XSchultz, 64, who helped grow Starbucks from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 countries, will become chairman emeritus on June 26. Myron Ullman will take over as the new head of the board, the company said in a statement.His exit will likely fuel speculation he could be gearing up for a presidential bid. In a letter to employees announcing his exit, he said that he is ""thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I'm a long way from knowing what the future holds.""Schultz's announcement was calculated to make a big splash. He gave an extended interview to the New York Times in advance, with an interview on CNBC scheduled for Tuesday morning. If Schultz decides to make a bid for the presidency, he could lean on the experience of one of a longtime board member, the former presidential candidate and ex-Senator Bill Bradley.Schultz is leaving a Starbucks that is still growing in the U.S. -- but not at the spectacular rates of the past. The company, now one of the world's largest restaurant chains, is betting big on China, where it plans to more than triple revenue in the next five years. But investors have been underwhelmed by the company's new outlook, with the shares falling about 11% in the last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The chain closed about 8,000 company-owned stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training last week, a decision that some shareholders questioned for the expense.Last April, Schultz transitioned from chief executive officer to executive chairman, where he oversaw the company's social impact initiatives. He also was working on growing the chain's premium Reserve brand that includes flagship roastery locations, as well as the partnership with Italian bakery Princi. His top lieutenant Kevin Johnson took over the CEO role last year.New chairman Ullman is a retail executive, who left the helm of J.C. Penney (JCP) in 2015 after stints at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and what's now Macy's (M).Schultz will be spending more time with his family this summer, as well as working on a book about the chain's social impact, the company said.Shares fell as much as 2.8% in late trading after the announcement.

924,A,"Apple got punched by sellers in Friday late-afternoon, dropping as much as 2.5% at the start, but shaved its losses. Plus, Apple's sell-off hardly dented the Nasdaq composite. The index, in fact, turned a moderate early-morning loss into a slight gain. Overall, the key indexes reversed from moderate losses into positive ground in stocks today as new NYSE stock leader Twitter surged.At 7645, the tech-driven composite edged up 0.2%. The leading index is off to a vigorous start in June, up nearly 2.7%. The S&P 500, up 0.2% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, also is doing well in June, rising nearly 3% for the month.Apple (AAPL) was the only stock within the Dow Jones industrial average to fall 1 point or more. The next worst decline: an 88-cent slip by fellow tech leader Intel (INTC). The chipmaking titan sank 1.5% to 55, but volume is light. No sell signals are being triggered. The Dow Jones industrials rallied 0.2% after falling only 0.3% early.See on a daily chart how Intel, up 19% year to date, holds a solid cushion above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and 10-week moving average.For more on how to use the 10-week moving average correctly to determine to best time to sell, please check out the latest Inside The IBD 50 column, published every Friday on Investors.com and in IBD Weekly.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) fund rallied 0.6% to 36.05. It's up 8.5% since Jan. 1, vs. a 3.8% advance for the S&P 500. The exchange-traded fund, which now shows an average daily volume of 209,000 shares, ran up 34% in 2017 while the 500 gained 19.4%.Apple is a member of IBD Leaderboard since May 4, when the megacap tech presented a correct entry point as it rallied sharply and rose past a 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double bottom.While Apple is extended past the 5% buy zone from that entry, the stock has presented a new follow-on entry at 190.47 after forming a rare 3-weeks-tight pattern.The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant fell on news reports that it plans to order fewer components for the iPhone in the second half of the year. Keep in mind, however, that the company continually innovates its formidable line of smartphones. Some media have reported that Apple is likely to introduce new versions in the fall.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Apple's fiscal Q3 earnings bolting 31% higher to $2.18 a share on a 15% revenue increase to $52.27 billion.For fiscal 2018, which ends in September, Apple's profit is seen growing 25% to $11.49 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since the Cupertino, Calif., company posted a 43% profit jump in FY 2015.The Street sees revenue rising 14% for the current fiscal year to $260.87 billion. Apple's market cap is currently $940 billion.Lending LeaderBofI Holding (BOFI), highlighted as IBD's Stock Of The Day, rebounded 1% to 44.47 in light turnover. The internet bank is still in buy range after clearing a 43.60 prime buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA), highlighted in this earlier Stock Market Today feature, gained nearly 0.7% to 319.05 in active trade. The former big winner in 2013-2015 is still in the early stages of building the right side of a potential new base.Twitter (TWTR), in Big Cap 20, is getting even more extended from its 33.88 buy point in an eight-week cup with handle. The stock rushed more than 3% higher to 41.40 in volume running more than 25% above its 50-day average.The social media network has now gained 21% past the proper entry. Taking gains in most stocks when you have a 20% to 25% profit is very sound portfolio management. But when you have supreme conviction in the company, holding longer may lead to stronger returns. But such stocks must have truly excellent fundamentals, high relative strength, and strong institutional sponsorship.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Twitter stands at a positive B+ on a scale of A to E, according to Stock Checkup. This means that over the past 13 weeks, fund managers have generally been net accumulators of Twitter shares.Twitter has scored four quarters in a row of earnings growth acceleration (from a 22% drop in Q1 2017 to flat growth the next quarter, then gains of 11%, 73%, and 129%). The Street sees Q2 earnings rising 113% to 17 cents a share.RELATED:Inside IBD 50: Why You Shouldn't Abuse This Key Sell Rule In StocksIBD Stock Of The Day: This Online Bank Is A Buy As Financial Giants StumbleHot Large Cap Firms: Inside IBD Big Cap 20Global Leaders In the IBD DatabaseHow To Find The Next Apple?

925,A,"Can the future really be female if an unspoken gender gap keeps quietly eating away at women's futures? While women have been shown to outperform men at investing, they tend to shun the stock market for the deceptive safety of cash savings, leaving men to reap the gains — and keep a grip on the world's private wealth.This disconnect between women and Wall Street runs deep. Hollywood portrayals only underscore the divide, from the chest-thumping boys' club in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to ""Sex and the City"" heroine Carrie Bradshaw. As she once said about investing, in a phrase that launched a thousand Etsy posters: ""I like my money right where I can see it — hanging in my closet.""In the real world, millennial women in particular are financially vulnerable. The investing gender gap can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. That means the difference between being in control of the future and being swept away by the undercurrent of daily expenses.""One thing we realize more than ever these days is that money is power. And that if you don't have as much money as the guys do, it can put you in a tough position,"" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of investing platform Ellevest. ""It can keep you in a job you don't want to do. It can keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. It can keep you from taking that trip around the world, or starting the business you've been dreaming about.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCompared with the average single man, the average single woman's net worth is three times smaller, according to a joint study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.Pay equity is part of the equation, compounded by the fact that women are more likely to pause their careers to raise children and take care of aging parents and spouses. Compared with a man with no workforce interruptions, the average woman cumulatively has earned $1.06 million less by the time she hits retirement age.""Women, generally, we're leaning in to our careers and we're becoming much more comfortable around being ambitious professionally. But we're not having that same dynamic (with our money),"" says Jennifer Barrett, a former CNBC personal finance editor and the current editor-in-chief of Grow, a web publication from micro-investing app Acorns. ""It's to our detriment if we don't invest.""No matter where you look, the numbers are pretty straightforward: Compared with men, women are tepid about the stock market. Some 57% of women didn't invest a dime in 2017, vs. 44% of men, according to a recent Acorns study. If handed a thousand bucks, 2.5 times more men than women said they would put that money in stocks. Women also lag men in 401(k) participation and contribution, says the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.Some women are already feeling the fear of missing out.The Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study found that 41% of women said their greatest financial regret was not investing more of their money. That even trumps career, credit-card and lifestyle woes.Thirty-year-old Caroline Rhoads, an account director at a marketing firm in Philadelphia, said Wall Street ""seems very intimidating.""She has consulted a financial planner once, invested around $1,000 through a Robinhood account, and feels good about her 401(k) and financial future. But she invests conservatively, ""because I feel like if I'm going to invest I need to know what I'm doing, and I don't.""Bridging the investing gender gap may seem abstract and distant, particularly for 20-something women mired in student debt, decades away from retirement. But there are serious consequences for not at least trying to get the ball rolling.""In not being comfortable investing, what you're saying is you're not comfortable building wealth,"" says Barrett. And the gender gap there is ""growing, not shrinking, even as women are earning more and closing the wage gap. We still have a gaping wealth gap.""If it's so important, why is there a dearth of female investors? What accounts for this gender gap in the market? More than a couple of things, it turns out.Think back to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's testosterone-fueled, Martin Scorsese-directed yacht parties, filled with models and bottles. And earlier this year, an E-Trade Financial (ETFC) ad showed men cavorting with bikini-clad women on a yacht. Who wouldn't want to be associated with that lifestyle?Uh, women.""I can't help but equate Wall Street with the a**hole bros filling lower Manhattan bars most nights, who drink too much, act rudely toward women, and generally behave badly,"" wrote Refinery29's Work & Money Director Lindsey Stanberry in a 2016 story on how to invest. ""Do I really want to put my hard-earned money in their hands? (No.)""Ellevest's Krawcheck says the fact that the investing gender gap even exists ""tells me that women are not being well served by the existing investing industry and by Wall Street.""She should know. Her Wall Street cred includes stints as the head of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's (C) wealth management divisions. Now she is a vocal proponent of something she calls ""financial feminism,"" or wealth equality between men and women.And no, the solution isn't slapping a bunch of pink labels on existing financial products. Of her days at the heavyweights, Krawcheck said efforts to appeal to female investors didn't consider their financial desires.Ellevest's ""gender-aware"" investing algorithms, she says, consider key differences about women. Their salaries peak sooner than men's. They earn less over their lifetimes. They are more likely than men to outlive their resources.So she aims to help investors reach their goals, not beat the market. Wall Street's obsession with outperforming the stock market indexes ""leaves women completely cold,"" she says.Female investors are more interested in reaching certain milestones, such as retiring at a certain income, buying a home or starting a business, she adds.And she's quick to dismiss the notion that women's risk aversion toward stocks drives the investing gender gap.""It's not that she's risk averse, she's risk aware. And the industry has done a poor job explaining risk to her,"" said Krawcheck of female investors. ""When she understands it, she's happy to take it.""But it's true that women are doing less with their money. Financial services startup SoFi found that men contribute 32% more to their investment accounts than women do, and tend to invest more aggressively.Meanwhile, women are equally or more confident than men in paying bills and setting budgets. But they're far less confident about managing their investments, say Merrill Lynch/Age Wave researchers.Maybe that's why female investors keep more of their money in cash. According to an oft-cited BlackRock study from 2015, female investors keep 68% of their portfolios in cash vs. men's 59%.The apparent safety of a savings account, however, is deceptive. Over the long run, hoarding cash is a terrible way to increase net worth. Consider the math: Interest rates on savings are near zero while inflation is now 2%, which means that $1,000 in the bank today is objectively worth less in the future.Additionally, it pays to take advantage of compounding interest.Say you invest $500 tomorrow in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Then add 50 bucks to that account every month thereafter. Say it grows by an average 8% every year. (Over the last 90 years, the average yearly return for the S&P 500 has been 9.8%, even accounting for crashes.) In 30 years, a no-interest savings account would have grown to $18,500. Your investment in the stock market would have amassed $73,001.26.Still, that's easier said than done for those who don't trust Wall Street. There's a whole generation of women and men who remain deeply distrustful of the stock market. Both the dot-com crash and the Great Recession blindsided them in their formative years.""In a short period of time, they saw two recessions and two market meltdowns,"" says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""Those memories are fresh. So a lot of (millennials) just never warmed up to equities and have taken a naturally risk-averse stance, detrimental though that may be to their long-term financial health.""Younger people prefer real estate and cash over the stock market, according to Bankrate surveys. And millennial women in particular are in a financially precarious position.""Here's my concern, and it's heightened for millennial women,"" says McBride. ""Millennials are going to have the biggest retirement savings burden in history,"" thanks to longer life spans, fewer pensions, more uncertainty around Social Security, and higher health costs than any generation before them. And holding on to safe-haven assets like gold, he says, is not going to cut it.""To accumulate retirement savings, you need the power of compounding to do the heavy lifting.""Michelle Trejo, a 29-year-old quality assurance engineer in Los Angeles, says that her main vehicle for retirement is her 401(k), though she isn't sure how much she's contributing. Once she saves more money, she is looking to invest in real estate, and then potentially in the stock market.""I wish I knew how to play (the stock market),"" says Trejo, who has dabbled in cryptocurrencies, a far higher-risk investment than stocks. ""I know there's a lot of money there. I just don't know how to get started.""Some experts venture that women get a one-sided directive about what to do with their money: Spend it.""Generally speaking, if you look at who's spending money on clothes and keeping up with the trends,"" says Barrett, ""it's not men. It's women.""Think about how many magazines or style blogs talk about buying ""investment pieces"": a classic necklace, a blazer that will never go out of style. An analysis from purse reseller Baghunter will have you believe that a Birkin bag from Hermes is a better purchase than gold. Of course, that assumes you hold on to the bag for 35 years and keep it in mint condition.""When we talk about buying a handbag as an investment, it makes me cringe,"" said Barrett.That mindset extends beyond the investing gender gap to the venture-capital world.Men with wealth are encouraged to amass more wealth, said The Helm CEO and co-founder Lindsey Taylor Wood at the recent United State of Women conference. Her venture fund invests in female entrepreneurs.""Their buddies are like, 'Get in on this deal, invest in this company, buy this stock,' "" she said. By contrast, ""women with wealth are invited to give their money away. 'Chair this gala, join this nonprofit, be on this board.' ""A notable 61% of women would rather chat about their own death (!) than talk about money, according to Merrill Lynch/Age Wave data.""In our society, talking about money is pretty taboo for women; we learn this from childhood,"" says Ellevest's Krawcheck. ""If you're not talking about money, how do you know what raise to ask for, or how to invest? The answer is: You don't. And women are the poorer for it.""That deep-rooted behavior is encoded early on. In fact, 63% of millennial women vs. 53% of their male peers learned from their parents about saving money at an early age, according to a recent PNC Investments survey. But only 29% of those same women said their parents showed them how to grow wealth, vs. 37% of men.""(There are the) stories that we tell ourselves and the stories that we've heard and internalize,"" says Acorns' Barrett, who is writing a book about the wealth gender gap. ""That investing is hard, that you need to be wealthy to invest. Women in particular get that message a lot. And if you look at the research — even the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money is different.""Kathy Mirescu, a 40-year-old director of product design, is far from the norm when it comes to enthusiasm for personal finance. It is a quality the Los Angeles resident learned from her mother, a self-taught commercial real estate investor with an accounting background who ""was always looking for investment opportunities and would talk about them"" openly with her three children.""I just grew up not really thinking about it, until I became a lot older, and I started realizing that a lot of my friends, a lot of my peers, who are college educated — a lot of them have advanced degrees — didn't know a lot of the things that I just knew"" about finance, said Mirescu.She bought her own condo at just 29. The down payment came from cash and proceeds from the sale of blue chip stocks that her mother bought for her early on in life.Now Mirescu wants to start an investing club that will help her friends and other women become more financially literate. ""To just simply have a place where we all get in a room,"" she said, and ""help each other set up Roth IRAs.""Acorns' survey found that 42% of women chose Oprah as the person they'd be most likely to take investing advice from. More than half of men chose Warren Buffett.That likely speaks more to women's trust in Oprah than the gender gap, says Barrett. But it also serves to highlight how few female investors are well known on Wall Street.""If you think about really famous investors — can you think of a woman?"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of female role models."" (According to the Merrill study, 45% of women don't have a financial role model, to be exact.)Krawcheck, who took the stage at the United State of Women conference to hearty applause, is an emerging rock star in the realm of financial feminism. At the mention of the Ellevest founder, Mirescu starts ""fan-girling."" (Her words.)She, too, sees money as a ""feminist issue.""""It's about having choices, and money gives you the freedom to have choices,"" says Mirescu.

927,A,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

931,A,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%. Revenue had soared 317% in 2015, then rose another 58% and 32% the next two years.Expect double bottoms to proliferate among leading stocks when the major indexes fall furiously in several waves. Great market leaders built double bottoms and broke out after the bear markets in the fall of 1998, the fall of 2002, and other occasions.Sometimes you'll see a handle form on the double bottom. It's the market's way of presenting an additional buy point.(Sanofi completed its acquisition of Bioverativ on March 8. A version of this column was published on March 1, 2018. Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on the financial markets, growth companies, charts and stock breakouts.)RELATED:This Is The Golden Rule Of InvestingWhat Is The Current Stock Market Direction?

Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development.

Among those, kid-friendly dollar store Five Below ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 104.09 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The IBD Leaderboard name scored a 22% breakaway gap on June 7, after crushing first-quarter expectations. Shares consolidated just below their June 13 high, completing a three-weeks-tight pattern on Friday. The June 7 breakout was from a third-stage base.

The handle presents a buy point at 25.79, and the stock traded less than 2% below that entry at Tuesday's close.

An investor who bought on the May breakout at 11.49 could've booked a 20% gain seven weeks later. Many IBD-style investors would've been happy to cash in the gain. Investors are operating in a news-driven market, which is a shaky foundation.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) was a tough stock to play but not impossible.

Then it began to slide. One IBD sell rule is to never let a decent profit cycle into a loss.Even a 3% gain or so is better than letting a trade turn negative.Energen (EGN) broke out in March, clearing a 58.04 buy point.

951,A,"Crude oil has the biggest footprint in the Spotlight screen right now. Five of the 16 stocks are oil stocks. Yet, investors have to wonder: Does that footprint say buy, sell or hold?Before that issue is broached, an investor might take note of where the strength in oil is concentrated.Of the five oil stocks in the screen, all are from the same industry group — the U.S. explorer and producer group. This is important. Investors can be right on oil. But if they are wrong on the industry group, gains will be harder to come by.For example, since Feb. 1 when light sweet crude marked a low, oil is up 25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. explorer stock group is up 28%. But the pipeline group is down 4% in the same period.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat about the oil stocks in the Spotlight screen?Going into Wednesday's session, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) was up 15% from a cup base. An investor who bought on the May breakout at 11.49 could've booked a 20% gain seven weeks later. Many IBD-style investors would've been happy to cash in the gain. Investors are operating in a news-driven market, which is a shaky foundation.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) was a tough stock to play but not impossible. The stock triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule in late May, but an IBD-style investor would've dodged the bullet. Why and how? After the breakout, the stock rose as much as 14% above the 25.20 buy point. Then it began to slide. One IBD sell rule is to never let a decent profit cycle into a loss.Even a 3% gain or so is better than letting a trade turn negative.Energen (EGN) broke out in March, clearing a 58.04 buy point. The stock reached the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone in May.Those who held on for more had a rough ride. After rising as much as 24% above the buy point, Energen retreated to just 4% above the entry. Those who held on are sitting on a 34% profit, but realistically that would've been a tough stock to hold.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) broke past a 26.29 correct buy point in April and advanced smoothly. The stock reached the 20% profit level about five weeks later.From there, action turned sloppy. The stock undercut the original buy point in mid-June.Diamondback Energy (FANG) has traded in choppy fashion since late January. It's hard to imagine an IBD-style investor getting into the stock at this point or even earlier.The price of oil is critical to oil stocks. Recently, light sweet crude has encountered resistance just under $75 a barrel.On Wednesday, there were reports that Saudi Arabia increased production in June, putting downward pressure on oil prices. Yet even though WTI crude oil futures dropped more than 4% on Wednesday, it's still trading at 3-1/2-year highs.Meanwhile, Iran is threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would drive oil prices higher and possibly start a war.

953,A,"The breadth of industries that feature stocks hitting new highs continues to be wide. On Tuesday, Salesforce.com (CRM), Five Below (FIVE) and Dillard's (DDS) are giving investors opportunities to add new positions to their portfolios.Salesforce, a June 2004 IPO, is up more than 2% for the week as shares continue to drive past a 128.97 buy point in a seven-week cup pattern.The 5% buy zone extends up to 135.42. Thus, the stock remains in the permissible buy range.Notice on a daily chart how the RS line, painted in blue, continues to pump into new high ground. Good. It confirms that the enterprise software play is beating the S&P 500. Since its February 2017 breakout from a first-stage base at 80.47, Salesforce has rallied more than 65%.The San Francisco-based firm has emerged as a real force of change within its field. CEO Marc Benioff, who left Oracle (ORCL) to start Salesforce, pushed for a new business model in which customers could download customer relationship management (CRM) software straight from the internet onto their computers — with no stacks of CDs to upload into their desktops. Salesforce sought to make its products affordable and easy to use.Today, the company has excelled in going beyond the CRM space and into service, marketing, data analytics, collaboration and AI. It continues to win multiple large contracts.In its April-ended first quarter, Salesforce achieved another milestone. Revenue grew 25% to $3.01 billion, marking the first time it logged $3 billion in quarterly sales. Salesforce had a total $3.05 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year ended in January 2013.On a quarterly basis, revenue has grown 25%, 27%, 25%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 27%, 26%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past 10 periods.Five Below has cleared a 78.38 entry in a six-week flat base. The Philadelphia-based retail innovator, popular among kids who can spend their allowances on items priced at $5 or less, reports fiscal Q1 results after the close on Wednesday.The Street sees earnings up 120% to 33 cents a share on a 25% rise in sales to $291.4 million. That would mark the biggest year-over-year profit increase since a 175% leap in the quarter ended July 2013.Five Below joined IBD Leaderboard as an earnings-related call option play on Wednesday.Dillard's rose more than 5% and reached as high as 93.58 intraday. At that price, shares stood more than 5% past the 88.61 buy point in a 12-week cup. Disciplined buying means grabbing shares when they are no more than 5% past the proper entry.While on a daily chart Dillard's may have showed handle-type action from May 21 to June 1, such a handle is invisible on the weekly chart. Treat that shakeout period as more attempts by the stock to build the right side of the cup.Dillard's has posted big earnings growth in the past two quarters (up 52% to $2.82 a share and up 36% to $2.89 on an adjusted basis) as the Little Rock, Ark., company ended a nine-quarter drought in sales growth with top-line gains of 6% in fiscal Q4 and 3% in Q1. The Street sees sales inching up 1% to $1.47 billion in the July-ending second quarter.Dillard's joins Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as new emerging leaders within the retail sector. All three belong to IBD's Retail-Department Store industry group, which as of Monday's close ranked No. 23 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance.RELATED:Why iQiyi Hit A New High And Triggered A Sell Signal, But Not As A Climax Run The Latest Inside Investor's CornerWhy Even In a Bull Market, The 5% Rule Matters For Stock Investors

954,A,"Business and Politics: Costco Wholesale Corp. announced late last week that it's giving raises to 130,000 employees, thanks to the Trump tax cuts. This is the company, mind you, whose founders openly backed tax-hiking Hillary Clinton for president. Why not admit that they picked the wrong horse?Costco (COST) boosted its minimum wage $1 an hour — to $14 — and gave its other hourly employee wages raises of up to 50 cents an hour. That's an annual increase of up to $2,000. Crumbs to Nancy Pelosi, but real money to a middle-class family on a budget.The company said it was funding the $100+ million in raises with savings from the sharp cut in the corporate tax rate. That rate cut was part of the Trump tax reform plan — which not a single Democratic lawmaker supported. Since then, hundreds of companies announced bonuses, raises, increased benefits because of the money they're saving on taxes.Costco's employees aren't the only ones benefiting. Since the November election, Costco stock has rocketed up by 32%. In the two years before the election, it climbed 8%.The irony here is that, had many of Costco's leaders got their wish, their workers wouldn't be getting those raises next week.In 2016, Costco board members, executives and employees gave $44,178 to Clinton's campaign and almost $92,000 to the DNC. The company's co-founders both endorsed Hillary Clinton and gave tens of thousands to her and other Democrats. Overall, Costco donors overwhelmingly favored Democrats that year.Costco isn't alone in this regard. Plenty of corporate leaders harshly attacked Trump before the election, and now their companies and employees are benefiting immensely from his tax cuts and deregulation.Shortly before the election, for example, then Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money that ""I think it's obvious Hillary Clinton needs to be the next president.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut as a direct result of Trump's tax cuts, Starbucks employees got stock grants of between $500 and $2,000 — totaling more than $100 million — as well as $120,000 million in raises.IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) Chairman Barry Diller promised in 2015 that if Trump were elected, ""I'll either move out of the country or join the resistance."" Last July, he said that Trump's presidency is ""just a joke (and) hopefully it will be over relatively soon.""IAC shareholders probably don't agree. In the months since Trump won the election, IAC stock shot up by almost 140%. In the two years before the 2016 elections, IAC's stock eked out a meager 1.5% gain. (Diller never did leave the country.)Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings — another prominent Clinton backer — said in June 2016 that ""Hillary Clinton is the strong leader we need, and it's important that Trump lose by a landslide to reject what he stands for."" Trump, he said, "" would destroy much of what is great about America.""Hastings might have a difficult time explaining this statement to Netflix shareholders. His company's stock has rocketed up more than 190% since Trump failed to lose by a landslide. In fact, it's climbed almost 90% just since the Trump tax cuts went into effect in January.On and on it goes. During the campaign, Clinton made a big deal about the fact that 56 prominent business leaders endorsed her for president. Yet many of them have seen the rising economic tide lifting their boats under Trump.Do any of these CEOs honestly believe that, had Clinton won the election, their companies would be doing as well as they are now? Not only did she oppose corporate tax cuts, Clinton wanted $1.4 trillion in tax hikes, as well as countless new mandates and regulations on businesses.For obvious reasons, Democratic politicians will never admit that they were wrong about Trumponomics, no matter how well the economy performs. But what about all those corporate leaders who put their names and reputations behind Hillary Clinton?Shouldn't they admit that, even if they can't stand Trump, their companies and their workers are better off as a result of the pro-growth economic policies that their chosen candidate never would have approved?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Was May's Job Report The Best Ever?Some Inconvenient Truths About RecyclingTrump Plays Dangerous Game Of Chicken With Trade Tariffs

955,A,"President Donald Trump's imminent decision on whether to hit China with tariffs starting Friday could easily make this the best or worst week of the year for the stock market. The implications of the Trump China tariff decision are that big: Either we're at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing, or — more likely — Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.The big Wall Street fear is that the Trump China tariff decision won't just trigger retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, but will provoke Beijing to find additional ways to hinder U.S. multinationals like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) in Chinese markets. Beijing has already held the merger of Qualcomm (QCOM) with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) hostage.The Dow Jones industrial average — which includes Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar — opened solidly lower on the stock market today, but rallied to close slightly higher. The Dow Jones remained just below its 200-day moving average after undercutting that key support last week. The S&P 500 index rose Monday after undercutting its 50-day line once again intraday. The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.8% gain.But if the Trump China tariff threat is put to rest — or at least put on hold — the relief could be palpable. In a Sunday note, Morgan Stanley warned that President Trump is likely to follow through on his tariff threats.""We no longer doubt that the U.S. administration's proposals signal the direction of trade policy.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""An escalatory cycle of protectionist actions, not just rhetoric, has begun and will continue,"" wrote Michael Zezas, chief strategist for U.S. public policy at Morgan Stanley.Growing alarm over Trump trade policy should give way to a major relief rally if the president calls a cease-fire with China this week.Trump is set to hit Beijing with 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly tech-related imports on Friday, July 6. The same day, China is ready to hit back — dollar for dollar — with tariffs aimed primarily at autos and agriculture. Chinese imports from Ford and Tesla would be hit with an extra 25% tariff, more than reversing Beijing's cut in auto import tariffs from 25% to 15%, effective July 1. Daimler has already warned that it expects Chinese tariffs on its Alabama-built Mercedes-Benz SUV to hit sales and profits.Here's why the deadline is so important: Trump has already bent over backward to appease Beijing. If the two sides can't make enough progress toward a trade cease-fire this week to avert the imposition of tariffs, then a deal will become even less likely as threats turn to outright hostilities, which may quickly escalate. The U.S. has tariffs on another $16 billion worth of goods from China, including semiconductors, nearly ready to go, and China is ready to retaliate. Beyond that, Trump has directed trade officials to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.But there's good reason to expect a deal, or at least a delay in the Trump China tariff deadline. If Trump really intended to launch a China trade war, he probably wouldn't have gone to bat to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs.First, he pledged to reverse sanctions that had forced Chinese communications gear firm ZTE out of business, pushing back against a Senate move to reject a lesser punishment. Then, last week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency China investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Trump instead took a less combative tack, backing legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Reading between the lines — and threats — Trump has already made pretty clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Even though it would have done relatively little to narrow the trade deficit with China, Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. Signs of an economic slowdown in China and financial fragility only raise the importance of a trade cease-fire.If Trump reaches an accord with China, Wall Street may begin to relax about Trump's threat to hit U.S. auto imports with tax of 20% to 25%. The European Union has reportedly threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300 billion worth of imports from the U.S., the equivalent of a full-scale trade war. But General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM) and other automakers have warned that Trump's plan could sink U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles a year and deliver a hit to manufacturing employment. Like Trump's threat to launch a full-scale trade war against Beijing, a big tax on auto imports looks so potentially disruptive to world trade that it may begin to be seen as lacking credibility.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trade War Fireworks Burn These 2 SectorsRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

961,A,"Chinese video streaming firm iQiyi (IQ) has rallied in four of the past five sessions, rose as much as 14% intraday Monday, and made a new high of 32.40.So, is the recent price action a climax run, and thus a sell signal?No. The quick reason: iQiyi simply hasn't shown the necessary size of gains that typically precede this offense-type sell signal.In a climax run, a stock goes up in a nearly vertical manner after rising steadily for months or years. Statistically, the stock will also rise 25% to 50% within the span of just a couple of weeks. It may also rise in seven of the past eight trading sessions, or in eight of 10 days.IQiyi has vaulted 42% in just five sessions. But in a typical climax run, most market leaders will have broken out of a base and rallied for a minimum 18 weeks. They usually will have already doubled, even tripled, in price, before staging the climax run. IQiyi fails to meet these criteria. The company debuted less than three months ago on March 29, pricing its IPO at 18 a share.At Monday's peak, the total gain was 80%.Still, the big swing seen in Monday trading is enough justification for holders to take at least some profits off the table. Why? IQiyi broke out of a three-week IPO base on May 10, bolting past a 20.60 buy point. The gain from that proper entry has now exceeded 50%.One of IBD's top offense-type sell rules is this: Take gains in most of your stocks when the breakout achieves a 20% to 25% advance from the proper buy point. If you have huge conviction in the company, then aiming for a 30% to 50% gain is fine. But at some point, you'll want to lock in gains before the winner goes into a natural price correction.The Baidu (BIDU) spinoff is seen as the Netflix of China, providing a platform for high-quality videos over the internet. In addition to original content, iQiyi also offers live broadcasts, online games and books and e-commerce services.The company's sales jumped 56% to $2.6 billion in 2017, but the company also lost $3.86 a share.Analysts see iQiyi posting a net loss of $1.37 a share this year and a loss of $1.09 in 2019.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) established a new follow-on buy point, a four-weeks-tight pattern as it unveiled new products and upgrades. Shares rose more than 1% and got as high as 193.41, 1.5% above a 190.47 entry. Volume is running below average as of Monday afternoon action.The four-weeks-tight is an extension of the three-weeks-tight pattern. The tight action reflects an unwillingness among institutional holders to sell their shares.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: What Is A Climax Run?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow Much Are These Companies Crushing The S&P 500 This Year?

Another review said 32% responded. At the median, patients responded for 6.7 months to 8.3 months. Patients didn't worsen for a median 5.5 months.The firm also plans studies of sacituzumab govitecan in never-before-treated patients and in those who've already undergone one prior therapy. Further, the firm is planning to combine sacituzumab govitecan with Clovis' cancer drug, Rubraca, as a breast cancer treatment.""Our planned collaboration with Clovis Oncology is very exciting as the two agents may synergize well based on their mechanisms of action from published preclinical models,"" Immunomedics Chief Business Officer Usama Malik said in a statement.In bladder cancer, Immunomedics has a Phase 2 study expected to begin next week. It also plans to collaborate with Clovis to study options for bladder cancer patients, Immunomedics said in a news release.On Sunday, Immunomedics presented data for cancer drug sacituzumab govitecan in patients with a form of metastatic breast cancer. Overall, 31% of patients responded to the therapy. At the median, patients responded for 7.4 months and didn't worsen for 6.8 months.Robert Iannone, chief medical officer for Immunomedics, noted that the treatment options for patients whose cancer progressed on standard hormone therapy and chemotherapy are limited.""We are seeking input from breast cancer experts and regulatory authorities regarding potential registration paths for sacituzumab govitecan in this large, underserved segment of breast cancer,"" he said in a statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFs

963,A,"Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Boeing (BA) are big-cap, brand-name stocks that are trading around buy points. But while these are well-known, liquid stocks, they all have pros and cons. Time to hit the stock charts.Apple has faded recently, but is still slightly extended from a conventional buy point. Tesla has run up to a key level as it closes on a possible breakout. FANG stock Alphabet is flirting with an entry, while Boeing is back in buy range, pulling back toward key support.Boeing and Apple are both Dow Jones stocks.Apple blasted out of a double-bottom base with a 179.04 buy point in early May. Shares rallied 17% over nine sessions, fueled by a triple whammy of strong earnings, a massive stock buyback and dividend plan, and news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had bought many more Apple shares in Q1.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn June 1, Apple cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern entry of 190.47. A three-weeks-tight breakout offers an opportunity for existing holders to add a few more shares. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was trading at new highs after several months of flat to lagging action. (The RS line is blue line in the charts below.)However, Apple stock has drifted lower on the last several sessions. Apple sank 1% to 188.03 on Friday, back below its three-weeks-tight entry. Volume was nearly double normal, but a triple-witching expiry may have inflated trading, especially at the close.Apple stock closed Friday still slightly extended from the 179.04 entry, with the 5% chase zone extending to 187.99.Apple dipped into buy range shortly after the open in Monday's stock market trading, but closed down just 10 cents at 188.74.One big question is whether Apple stock is going to resume treading water. After all, Apple isn't going to announce a one-two-three punch of earnings-buyback-Buffett on a regular basis. Services growth is strong, but iPhone sales are sluggish.Tesla slumped from mid-September to early April, with its RS line peaking in June 2017. But since then the stock has bounced back, especially in the last few weeks. Tesla stock has rallied 30% since May 22, with nearly all of that in June.Shares rose 0.1% to 358.17 on Friday after hitting 364.67 intraday. Tesla stock has struggled around the 360 level several times over the last few months.But Tesla stock blasted through that resistance area on Monday, rose 3.5% to 370.83, hitting its best levels since late September. Volume was tracking sharply higher, continuing a bullish trend of solid price gains on active trading.Tesla stock is closing in on a buy point of 389.71.Keep in mind that Tesla's RS line is still well off highs.Also, Tesla's rise has come amid bold promises from Tesla and CEO Elon Musk. Musk says Tesla very likely will hit its Model 3 production target of 5,000 a week by the end of June. He also expects Tesla to be profitable in the third quarter. And Tesla has said it'll provide a big upgrade to Autopilot, which has been involved in several fatal accidents.If Tesla achieves or comes close to meeting those, its prospects will look brighter and the stock may keep rising. But if the electric automaker misses badly once again, then the stock rally could reverse.Google-parent Alphabet flirted with a breakout on Thursday and Friday, crossing the 1,161.20 handle buy point from a double-bottom base, but couldn't settle above it. Shares closed down 0.1% to 1159.27 on Friday.The RS line is at highs, but Google stock hasn't really outperformed the S&P 500 index since May 2017.Early Monday morning, Alphabet's Google announced a $550 million investment into Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (JD). That could help JD.com expand beyond China and Southeast Asia. Google will have less than 1% stake in JD. Walmart (WMT) also has a small stake in JD, which boasts Tencent (TCEHY) as a major shareholder and strategic partner.Alphabet stock rose 2.1% to 1,183.58, moving above the buy point, though volume was below average. Google also cleared an alternate entry of 1,178.26, just above the middle of the W in the double-bottom base.Boeing stock cleared a 347.77 cup-with-handle base on May 17. The handle wasn't visible on a weekly chart and volume on the breakout day was below normal. Volume was 32% above normal on the second day, which is OK but not great.The aerospace giant rallied in part on positive trade winds, as Trump appeared to have a tentative China deal. Shares became slightly extended but have since pulled back into buy range. On Friday, the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on each other, raising the risk of further escalation. Boeing stock fell 1.25% to 357.88 on Friday. It's also nearing its rising 50-day line.Boeing stock fell 0.9% to 354.74 Monday.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Dow Jones Futures: These 5 Chip Stocks Are Near Buy PointsWhy These Explosive China Stocks Are Due For Pullbacks IBD Stock Of The Day Nears Buy With Earnings Growth Set To Accelerate This Top IPO Stock Just Crushed Earnings EstimatesMicron, Red Hat, Oracle Earnings; OPEC Meeting: Investing Action PlanU.S., China Slap Tariffs On Each Other: Why The Trade War Is Going To Get Worse

983,A,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) has seen its shares surge to record-high territory ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, due after the market close on Monday.

It hit a record high of 423.21 on June 21.The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company has forecast adding 6.2 million subscribers in the second quarter. That would boost its total to 131.2 million subscribers worldwide.Analysts expect Netflix to earn 79 cents a share on sales of $3.94 billion for the June period. In the year-earlier quarter, it earned 15 cents a share on sales of $2.79 billion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the September quarter, Wall Street is modeling Netflix to earn 74 cents a share on sales of $4.14 billion. That compares with earnings per share of 29 cents on sales of $2.98 billion in the year-earlier period.Netflix has been a battleground stock as bears and bulls clash over its proper valuation. Bears say the stock is overvalued because the company is burning through cash at a blistering pace as it ramps up production of original content. Bulls say Netflix is the clear winner in the shift from linear television to on-demand streaming video.Nomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley on Wednesday initiated coverage of Netflix with a neutral rating. He set a price target of 370.""Netflix's expansion has been an undeniable success story, and we think that significant opportunity remains for both subscriber growth and ARPU (average revenue per user) increases,"" he said in a report. ""However, the company faces intense competition, a maturing U.S. market, and the potential for a longer-than-expected international ramp. As such, the stock's near all-time high valuation leaves us cautious in the near term.""Netflix's competitors include Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu today, with Apple (AAPL) and Walt Disney (DIS) entering the market next year.Also Wednesday, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives reiterated his ""highly attractive"" rating on Netflix stock with a price target of 500.He predicted that Netflix ""will handily beat"" Wall Street's consensus estimates for the second quarter.Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White on Monday maintained his buy rating and price target of 460 on Netflix stock.""Netflix's stock is up 113% year to date and thus needs another quarter of strong results to keep the stock moving in an upward trajectory,"" he said in a report. ""In our view, the combination of engaging new content, momentum in overseas markets and a business model that is successfully scaling on a global basis has given the market enough ammunition to expand the stock's valuation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Survey Underscores Netflix Dominance In Living RoomNetflix Stock Seen As Fairly Valued Ahead Of Likely Solid Earnings Report

984,A,"It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of Facebook (FB) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.It cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle base during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume (1). The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. That was the case at the time.The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its 10-week moving average.Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher (2). It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an IBD profit-taking rule that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A flat base eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point (3), but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings. Investors were also cheered by a boost in daily user growth to 1.45 billion.RELATED:How The Correct Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Ins And Outs Of A Double-Bottom BaseFacebook Will Reorganize Into Three Divisions, Plans Blockchain GroupGlobal Stock LeadersWhich Companies Are New To Key IBD Growth Stock Screens?

1000,A,"Akorn's (AKRX) top executive complained Tuesday that Fresenius (FMS) officials are unfairly smearing his firm's reputation as Fresenius tries to pull out of $4.3 billion deal to buy the generic-drug maker.Raj Rai, Akorn's chief executive since 2010, told a judge Tuesday that Fresenius' claims that flaws in the company's computer system led to fraudulent test results aren't true. Akorn says that Fresenius is using minor mistakes to create a pretext for backing out of the $34-per-share buyout.Hurting Akorn's reputation with false claims ""is not right,"" Rai told Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster. ""Customers are sensitive to what is happening to us.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLaster must decide whether Fresenius properly walked away from the Akorn deal in April or whether the German company must finalize the buyout. Some analysts have predicted that the deal could still close at a lower price.Fresenius officials say Akorn's testing miscues, and a history of operational problems that drew warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justify canceling the deal. They point to what they allege are phony drug-test results. Those were included in FDA submissions to back up their allegations of fraud. The company was forced to withdraw one of the submissions.Under cross-examination, Rai acknowledged that Akorn hasn't lost any customers as a result of Fresenius' fraud claims. The generic drugmaker, once run by billionaire John Kapoor, wouldn't collapse if the deal fell through, Rai contends. Kapoor, now under indictment for racketeering, is Akorn's largest shareholder.Earlier Tuesday, a lawyer for Fresenius said a review of Akorn's computer system found flaws in its security system. Security was so lax, they said, any employee or vendor could review or change the firm's drug-testing data.John Avellanet, a consultant that Akorn hired in 2016 after regulators questioned its operational procedures, made the discovery. He found executives had little security control over the pharma company's computer system. That raised doubts about the integrity of its record-keeping, Lewis Clayton, one of Fresenius' lawyers, said Monday.Akorn fell as much as 4.6%, the most intraday since May 3. Shares had climbed 2.8% Monday. Fresenius fell 0.4%. On the stock market today, Akorn lost 3.3%, to 17.97, at the closing bell.

Biosimilars are nearly identical copies of biologic drugs.""With our estimates suggesting the biologic blockbuster Humira accounts for 60% of AbbVie's total (net present value), we remain cautious on AbbVie's outlook in front of Humira biosimilar competition,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

He noted that AbbVie recently lowered its 2018 Humira sales guidance in the U.S. That cut represents additional pressure from insurers and less ability to raise prices in the U.S., he said.Divan reiterated his underperform rating on AbbVie. His comments followed a decision Thursday from the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw and reconfigure draft guidance for developing biosimilars.The decision is intriguing, he said.""Our interpretation of this development is that the FDA is learning (along with all of us) what is necessary in order to ensure safe and effective, but also cost effective and efficient, development of biosimilars in the United States,"" he said.Divan expects the FDA to issue updated guidance in the coming months. On Thursday, the FDA said it decided to withdraw the guidance based on public comments. It now plans to rework the guide for developing biosimilars with further consideration of scientific and regulatory issues.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted the potential for biosimilars to foster competition and lower the cost of biologic treatments. President Donald Trump has long argued for competition to help bring down the price of drugs for American consumers.""Yet the market for these products is not advancing as quickly as I hoped,"" Gottlieb said in a written statement.

1010,A,"Dow Jones futures rose Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, after the stock market averages reversed lower Wednesday. The chip sector, which usually is a key part of stock market rallies, is quietly tumbling. Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU) and Nvidia (NVDA) stock breakouts have failed, while Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO) and many others never got to a buy zone.On Wednesday, the major stock market averages initially rallied as President Donald Trump softened his stance on China investment restrictions. But the Nasdaq composite reversed lower, closing down 1.5% to just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index sank 0.9%, settling below its 50-day line for the first time since May 8. The Dow Jones retreated 0.7% after reclaiming its 200-day line intraday.The stock market rally, already under pressure, is in more distress now.Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 2.5% to below its 200-day line. Except for a few days two months ago, the Philly Sox chip index hasn't been below that level in two years.Intel stock has fallen 15% from its June 4 peak. On June 18, the world's largest chipmaker fell below a messy flat-base buy point and the 50-day line. Intel stock has kept falling.Nvidia stock had cleared a flattish double-bottom buy point of 239.25 on May 4, reclaiming its 50-day as well. Shares of the graphics chipmaker rallied to 269.20 on June 14, but then began retreating. By June 25, Nvidia had fallen below its 50-day and round-tripped a double-digit gain to close below its buy point.Micron Technology ran up in the right side of a cup base in late May on earnings guidance and buyback news, briefly topping a buy point but never closing above it. Micron stock then tried to form a high handle formation, but has fallen back despite strong earnings and guidance last week. This week, Micron stock has tumbled below its 50-day line.Taiwan Semiconductor stock, the world's largest chip foundry, hit its worst levels since last August. Broadcom stock, a notable Apple (AAPL) iPhone chipmaker, has been struggling for the past seven months.Semiconductors tend to take part in any significant stock market uptrend. So if Intel stock, Micron stock and other chips are struggling, it's hard for the broader market to move forward. The Philly Sox index hit a short-term peak on June 7, below their March 13 record high, a few days before the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones began topping out.Why do they matter? Chip stocks account for a big share of stock market capitalization, especially in the Nasdaq. But they're also used in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to servers to under the hood of your car. So if chip stocks are struggling, it's a bad sign for many end products as well.Energy groups accounted for the five top-performing industries Wednesday out of the 197 that IBD tracks. U.S. crude prices soared to their best close 2014 as plunging domestic supplies joining fears about U.S. sanctions on Iran exports.

The contract is worth up to $14.3 billion.While a final decision has yet to be made by the Canadian government, tensions are high after the Trump administration pressed ahead with plans to slap tariffs on its aluminum and steel products. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and other products.Boeing was already facing problems after the NATO ally's government said bids will partially be evaluated by examining whether firms have caused any past economic damage to Canada.

Prices reversed higher, with Brent crude up 1.6% to $74.25 per barrel and West Texas intermediate rising 1.3% and trading above $66 a barrel. Prices rose despite reports that Iran had softened its opposition to an agreement to increase production, making a boost in oil supply more likely.Much like the central banks that stimulated their economies through buying bonds and holding down interest rates, OPEC and Russia agreed in November 2016 to reduce oil output to bolster glut-weakened oil prices. The strategy was effective and, like the central banks that have gradually tapered their stimulus programs, OPEC appears set to release the cap on its production.How quickly they might do that is the question global energy and financial markets are asking.

1062,A,"Tesla (TSLA) stock was up for the second straight day Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk hit back at a Goldman Sachs report saying the electric-car manufacturer is likely to miss production numbers for its Model 3 sedan.X""They are in for a rude awakening :)"" Musk wrote in response, in an email Tuesday. The only other text in the email was a link to the CNBC story about the report, CNBC said.Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino in a report Tuesday said he believes Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus. In a research note to clients, Tamberrino said he thinks the company will report Model 3 deliveries of 22,000 in the second quarter. That is higher than his previous estimate of 19,000, but below the consensus estimate of 28,000.Tesla is expected to release its second-quarter production and delivery numbers in the first few days of July.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Tesla stock is up about 3.4% in the last two days.Musk has set a goal of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of this month. Whether he'll achieve that is not yet clear, as actual production numbers have been kept close to the vest. But Musk has indicated several times in the past month that he expects to meet production goals.If the company can more than double Model 3 output from the prior quarter to 5,000 a week, Musk believes the company can be profitable in the third quarter and avoid having to raise cash. But profitability continually eludes the company.Wall Street is divided on whether Musk can pull it all off. Tamberrino says he thinks it's possible that Tesla will, at some point, hit Model 3 production goals but questioned whether they can do it on a sustainable basis.""The question that will remain is how sustainable that run-rate of production is for the third quarter, given the historical volatility of the Model 3 production rate, where Tesla has taken intermittent downtime,"" he wrote.The stock is now pricing in a sustained 5,000 per week production rate, Tamberrino wrote. That follows the bullish tone on the production rate during the company's annual shareholder meeting on June 5.For the company's Model S and Model X, Tamberrino expect Tesla will maintain production at approximately 25,000 per quarter. In total, for the second quarter, Tamberrino thinks the company Tesla will have delivered 45,000 vehicles, an increase from previous expectations of 41,500.The long-term Model 3 goal is to ramp up production to 500,000 vehicles per year. That's a huge leap from its 100,000 annual run rate for the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle.RELATED:Can Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?Tesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetTesla Closing Up To 14 Solar Facilities As Part Of 9% Workforce Cuts

1077,A,"Just as Prime Minister Theresa May softened her plan for leaving the European Union -- a move that companies welcomed -- the resignation of the U.K.'s top Brexit officials and foreign secretary creates new uncertainty for business.XCarolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, called the weekend resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his deputy, Steve Baker, a ""blow"" on Monday morning. On Monday afternoon, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also resigned.The departures come just days after May said she had secured cabinet backing for a plan to keep close ties to the European Union. The resignations increase the chances she'll face a leadership challenge over her Brexit policy.""One of the things that business welcomed on Friday was finally cabinet unity,"" Fairbairn said on BBC Radio. ""It's all going to be about what happens next, because actually there were real rays of light in the conclusion from Friday.""May on Monday named Dominic Raab, a housing minister and Brexit backer, to replace Davis as Brexit secretary. Johnson's replacement is yet to be announced.While business has favored greater alignment with the EU, the departures could destabilize May's government, creating new turmoil for companies trying to figure out how to deal with Brexit. Before May announced the cabinet agreement, companies ranging from Airbus (EADSY) to Jaguar Land Rover to BMW warned of the consequences of leaving the EU with no deal or one that's unfriendly to global businesses.Dutch health-technology company Philips (PHG) also said over the weekend that it may move manufacturing out of the U.K., where it employs 1,500 people, in the event of a hard Brexit.Though the resignations could give May the chance to install a Brexit team that's more attuned to business concerns, the prospect of challenges to her leadership adds a degree of uncertainty that makes it hard for companies to plan investments.But for a lot of businesses, the departures will be seen purely as personnel changes, according to William Bain, a British Retail Consortium policy adviser and former lawmaker. What companies are focused on now is the white paper that will be published Thursday.""We know the twists and turns there can be in politics but what's fundamental is, are we making progress toward our withdrawal agreement?"" Bain said. ""Are we, in terms of the final relationship, getting to something that's going to avoid border controls?""In a sign of the fallout, investment from abroad in Britain's financial-services firms fell 26% last year, EY said in a report released Monday. During the same period, Germany experienced a 64% increase, while the figure for France more than doubled.The pound was trading down 0.1% at $1.3274 shortly after Johnson's resignation was announced.Even for those businesses that welcomed the direction the government set out Friday, uncertainty remains over whether the EU will go along with it.""For a big part of the economy, the proposals on the table will not be sufficient,"" said Pascal Kerneis, managing director of the European Services Forum, which lobbies for services companies including BT Group Plc. ""In any case, it remains to be seen whether the EU will accept it.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1084,A,"When people have had military careers as long as ours, they develop a keen understanding not just of war but also of the conditions leading up to it. Over the years, we have had front-row seats to hostilities in various regions of the world, and our attention often focused on the initial outbreak of those hostilities.Now, viewing current conditions through that lens, we are worried about the possibility of a larger war enveloping the Middle East – one in which the United States and its allies would be necessarily involved.As those conditions persist, the international community must do one of two things: Either ready itself for war or address the situation that is making it an ever more likely possibility. There is no question that the American public and nearly all U.S. policymakers would prefer the latter option. The trouble is that only a minority of them recognize the warning signs, and even fewer have a clear sense of which actions might slow the region's march toward war.To their credit, some key figures in the Trump administration have expressed an understanding of one of the most serious contributors to the existing threat. Defense Secretary James Mattis, for instance, has repeatedly affirmed that among all the crises engulfing the Middle East, the common element in almost all of them is the Islamic Republic of Iran.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe clerical regime has already had the effect of prolonging and worsening specific conflicts like the wars in Syria and Yemen, and is promoting sectarianism all over the region.For that reason, the most important thing the international community can do to prevent such a conflict from breaking out is contain Iran's regional activities while addressing their root causes. Unfortunately, policies leading toward that goal will surely face pushback from defenders of the status quo, who generally worry that all efforts to confront or contain regional adversaries constitute a rush to war.But anyone who is familiar with military history should recognize that the most troublesome wars tend to emerge out of long periods of inaction, during which responsible parties ignored festering hostilities and simply hoped for tensions to deescalate on their own.That is a course of action we cannot afford, since any forthcoming war would almost certainly engulf the entire region and undermine our interests for years or decades to come. And this is to say nothing of the impact it would have on the peoples of the Middle East, including those who are directly subject to the rule of the war's key instigator, the Iranian regime.It may be helpful to point out that the Iranian people recognize the danger they are facing and stand ready to assist the effort to diminish their government's ambitions and limit the role of Iranian sectarianism in neighboring countries like Syria.With this in mind, the governments of the U.S. and Europe should recognize the potential impact of forcing Tehran to confront domestic conditions instead of striving to exploit regional vulnerabilities. This isn't a particularly difficult task, considering that the Islamic Republic is already being rocked by widespread unrest as the people protest several serious issues as well as the very nature of the regime.In December and January, a nationwide uprising engulfed 140 Iranian localities and took the regime by surprise. That surprise was evident from the fact that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was left with no choice but to break with his traditional strategy of downplaying and denying the political strength of the pro-democratic opposition. He publicly attributed the protests' rapid spread and provocative slogans to the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK/PMOI).In the ensuing months, Iranian activists and workers continued staging large demonstrations in clear defiance of the violent repression that put the January uprising on pause.Defenders of the status quo may be uncomfortable with the notion of persistent unrest in Iran. But for global stability and for the Iranian people themselves, this is a far preferable alternative to the Islamic Republic keeping its attention focused beyond its border, where it can continue sowing the seeds of region-wide conflict while threatening to set off a war that the U.S. cannot ignore.On June 30, Iranian expatriates and thousands of political supporters held a major rally in Paris to support the Iranian demonstrators. The annual event typically attracts a crowd of 100,000 to call attention to domestic pressures against Iran's clerical regime and to outline Western policies that might help to enhance that pressure and contribute to the establishment of democratic governance in Iran.This year, more than 33 current and former U.S. officials attended.This gathering is a first step toward promoting Iran's domestic resistance movement and signaling commitment to helping it to avert a larger war in the region. This would make permanent the otherwise temporary effects of just containing Iran's regional activities.This is to say, the root cause of those activities and of the looming Middle East war is the very nature of the mullahs' regime, and in order to eliminate the present risks once and for all,that regime must give way to its overwhelmingly pro-democratic and peace-loving population.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1085,A,"While software, semiconductor and internet stocks have enjoyed a productive 2018, cloud computing has had its share of success, too, making First Trust Cloud Computing (SKYY) a leading ETF.Cloud computing is a field that crosses into various industry groups. Companies in IBD's data storage, networking, online retail, enterprise software and other groups are part of the First Trust Cloud Computing portfolio. The ETF breaks down its holdings by software (nearly 39%), internet software and services (14.8%), communications equipment (14.2%) and a few other industries.Only some of the fund's holdings are pure-play cloud companies. First Trust says the holdings are divided among three classes. One is pure plays, another is companies that support cloud providers, and a third type is large companies with broad operations that indirectly use or support cloud computing. That last segment's weight in the portfolio is capped at 10%.With many of the technology giants among its 30 holdings, First Trust Cloud Computing is predominantly a large-cap ETF. The median market capitalization is $40.38 billion. It excludes stocks with less than $100 million in market cap.The largest component is Netflix (NFLX), with more than 7% of the portfolio. Netflix, which started as a DVD rent-by-mail service, is now predominantly a streaming video service. The stock is up more than 70% from a breakout to new highs at the start of the year.Amazon.com (AMZN), the No. 2 holding, may be best known for online retail, but it has a bustling cloud business. In its Q1 earnings report, Amazon said its cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, had revenue of $5.44 billion. That was up 49% and above estimates of about $5.3 billion.Other holdings are Akamai Technologies (AKAM), whose technology improves streaming content; network optimization expert F5 Networks (FFIV); Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in customer management software on demand; and Zynga (ZNGA), whose games are played on social networks and mobile devices.The ETF on May 7 cleared the 51.26 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and remains in buy range. The relative strength line is trending higher and near new highs, which can be read as a positive sign.Long term, the ETF has been a solid investment. Shares have climbed about 65% since they broke out to new highs nearly two years ago. That July 2016 breakout was important because the ETF beat resistance around 31 that had dogged shares for more than a year.Most of First Trust Cloud Computing's ascent in that time has been smooth, partly because the broad market saw little volatility in 2017. This year, the ETF has been more volatile, reflecting the general market. Shares have slid 12% and 11% in two corrections this year.RELATED:Active Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexAmazon Stock Jumps As Earnings Slaughter Views, Prime Fee RaisedSalesforce.com Price Target Hiked; MuleSoft To Spur Cloud Computing

1089,A,"The major trade news this week is President Trump's decision whether to hit China with new tariffs starting Friday. Those headlines — about whether the Trump tariffs aimed at China are on or off — will be huge for the stock market.If they're on, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.The stock market rally is under pressure, largely due to Trump trade war fears. The S&P 500 index rose solidly Thursday, reclaiming its 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones rallied to just above its 200-day line.Yet a weightier headline for the future of world trade and U.S. economic leadership already hit on Sunday: ""World's Biggest Trading Bloc a Step Closer After Tokyo Meeting."" China took another step toward forming a 16-nation trade zone with Japan and India, covering one-third of the world economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina is moving into the vacuum left after Trump's rejection of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership forged by President Obama to ensure lasting U.S. influence in the Far East.""As protectionism concerns increase globally, it's important that the Asian region flies the flag of free trade,"" Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko said at a news conference, playing up potential for a year-end agreement.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that spurred Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.While Japan remains wary of China, Trump's metal tariffs and abandonment of the TPP have Tokyo focused on tighter links with Beijing.This spring, Trump briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP, having scrapped the deal four days after taking office. That was a clear signal Trump follows his gut instincts at the cost of any strategic approach to trade policy.Trump is trying to use America's big trade deficit as leverage to secure an easy trade-war win. But any win against China will be short term and do little to narrow its $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S. and alter its systematic push to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.Before negotiations hit a wall, Trump largely declared victory in late May, when China offered to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.No question, stocks will rally if such a deal reemerges to avert a China trade war. But China will have given up little, while the U.S. will have ceded a lot.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump Tariffs Go Live; Still One Chance To Avert Brutal China Trade WarBreakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

1094,A,"Judiciary: In federal Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump has found yet another solid constitutional conservative for an empty seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Contrary to the shrieking protests heard outside the Supreme Court building on Monday night, the 53-year-old Kavanaugh will be a genuine protector of Americans' rights — just as Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump placed on the court last year, is.Kavanaugh, like Gorsuch, is an originalist. That's not something anyone — left, right or center, Democrat, Independent or Republican — should fear. It means that Kavanaugh, just like Gorsuch, late-Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito, will look at the Constitution first when making decisions.That is how our system was designed from the very beginning. It's not a tool for unbounded activism, as many on the left seem to feel.The Supreme Court is the sole final guardian of the Constitution, the law of our land. The Constitution, and in particular its Bill of Rights, were intended to serve as a basic list of irrevocable rights for U.S. citizens. It's not a tool for unbounded activism, as many on the left seem to feel. Any judge who doesn't take this seriously doesn't belong on the bench.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseKavanaugh does. As he said Monday night, ""My judicial philosophy is straightforward. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.""That's about as good a working definition of the originalist creed as exists.Even so, Kavanaugh is an establishment conservative. He will not push revolutionary shifts in Supreme Court decisions. After all, he's a Yale Law School grad, who has taught at Yale, Harvard and Georgetown. No doubt, he understands the political dimension of the law, having worked in George W. Bush's administration and as a staffer for Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. He clerked for Justice Kennedy, whose High Court seat he would fill, and has served as a federal judge since 2006.And, as Kavanaugh himself noted, he was actually hired to teach at Harvard by then-Harvard Law Dean Elena Kagan — now on the Supreme Court.Solid credentials.But the immediate angry and loud reaction to his nomination by Democrats and others on the left suggests Kavanaugh will have an uphill political battle to get on the court. President Trump wants a vote by October 1.Two Republican senators — Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — say they'll scrutinize Trump's nominee carefully. Both senators are ardent supporters of the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal across the U.S.On the other side of the aisle, last year Gorsuch received votes from Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All three are moderates elected from states that voted for Trump.But none has yet committed to vote for Kavanaugh.It should be noted that though these five votes are seen as problematic, it's also the case that all of them voted for Gorsuch — whom many agree is more judicially conservative in his leanings than Kavanaugh.Most Democrats have vowed to oppose Kavanaugh, regardless. As Trump named Kavanaugh as his pick, a parade of far-left Democrats and their followers rallied before the Supreme Court, calling for Kavanaugh's rejection.No one argues he isn't qualified. They just don't like his decisions. Or really, any conservative's decisions, whatever they are.Indeed, as the leftist Women's March group showed in their tweeted release, it didn't matter who Trump named. It read thusly: ""In response to the president's nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States, The Women's March released the following: ""Yes, that ""XX"" is an awful judge. Truth is, they didn't need to wait.Nor did NPR's way-left Supreme Court correspondent, Nina Totenberg, who said, quoting the rock group REM, ""this is the end of the world as we know it."" Problem is, she said that nearly two weeks before she knew who the nominee was.We've been here before. Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, both conservative jurists, were vilified, slandered and attacked publicly for the crime of being Republican nominees to the court. Only Thomas made it on, and just barely. In one of the great injustices of the Senate approval process, Democrats and their organized far-left media mob forced Bork, one of the best-qualified nominees in history to the court, to withdraw after a sickening campaign of defamation and character assassination.In short, the Democratic left politicized the selection of court justices as never before, nearly ruining two decent men. For Democrats and others on the left, it's a legacy  of lasting shame.Democrats say there's ""too much at stake"" with midterm elections coming up to approve of Kavanaugh. But we remind Americans that Republicans during the 2010 midterm elections approved both liberal Sonia Sotomayor (in August, 2009) and Elena Kagan (in August 2010).Republicans didn't like either, and had profound philosophical differences with both, but didn't obstruct them, either.Compare that with Democrats today, as they throw the political equivalent of a child's temper tantrum and vow to oppose and obstruct Kavanaugh from taking a seat on the high bench. There will no doubt be verbal anger and perhaps even violence. They will accuse him of supporting back-alley abortions (a lie). They will say his decisions as a judge that limit the federal bureaucracy's regulatory reach are ""pro-corporation"" and ""anti-environment.""None of that is true. He's neither ""pro-corporation"" nor ""anti-environment."" He's pro-Constitution.Yes, as we noted, Kavanaugh is conservative. But he's also principled. He won't toe a party line. These days, that's all the so-called progressives and their allies in the judiciary have: A party line, one that tilts increasingly to the far left.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Justice Kennedy's First Priority: The First AmendmentGorsuch Strikes A Blow Against The Administrative StateAfter A String Of Huge Supreme Court Wins, Will Never-Trumpers Admit They Were Wrong?

1102,A,"Selling stocks at the top is a worthy goal for swing trading but easier said than done. Combining the context of the stock market indexes with the price action in individual stocks can inform your selling decisions. That was how a sell in Akamai Technologies ended up within 1% from its recent top.Your success in a swing trade doesn't just depend on a single decision or metric. It starts with buying right. Then determining your holding rules. Finally, how to maximize your profits or reduce your losses when selling stocks.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) formed a classic cup-with-handle pattern in March and April. It joined IBD's SwingTrader after breaking out on June 5 at 78.43 with double its average volume (1). The stop loss was a little different on this one. Normally, a stop loss at the low of the entry day is appropriate. A drop below that level usually signals the stock may need more time to consolidate. For swing trading, we'd rather take the small loss and move on to a new opportunity. That helps us maximize profits in our shorter time frame.For Akamai, a stop loss at the entry day low was too tight, less than 1.5%. If you make your stop too tight, a loss is more likely due to a brief shakeout. In this case, we moved the stop loss to the prior day's low for a 3% risk percentage. A proper stop loss is essential for holding a stock.That extra room came in handy since the stock did challenge the low of the entry day the very next session (2). Two days later, Akamai fell again. This time it fell below the 5-day moving average and re-challenged the entry day low but reversed strongly (3). A tighter stop loss would mean taking a loss in this trade and missing the subsequent move. It also demonstrates why we wait to see if the stock closes below the 5-day moving average line or gets support before making our sell decision.After two weeks, we hit our 5% profit goal and took full profits at 82.38 (4). Those familiar with our swing trading strategies may note a departure from our normal routine in selling stocks. Usually, we take half profits at the 5% level and see if we can maximize profits toward a 10% profit goal. Two things influenced the decision for the early sell here.First, the time of the trade. Swing trading looks at a typical trade length of just a couple of weeks. We seek short explosive moves and then take profits on the way up. This often avoids pullbacks that follow. We were already at a trade length of two weeks when we hit the 5% profit goal.Second, the Nasdaq composite was already extended when Akamai Technologies joined SwingTrader. At the time of the sell, the index was holding up well enough but showed difficulty making progress. Market context is a huge factor in determining whether holding or selling stocks is more appropriate. Akamai did have a couple attempts at progress above 83 but couldn't hold it long. Less than a week after the sell and the stock was down 3% from our exit price.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenDon't Be Greedy!

Square advanced almost 23% before starting a new consolidation.Another breakout occurred in late May, but volume was below average. Volume should be at least 40% above normal on a breakout.

Unlike large employers, which are allowed under federal law to design their own plans, small entities must adhere to stricter coverage mandates and have less ability to customize plans.An estimated 15 million Americans — and their families — who are self-employed or work for a small business lack health care coverage. It's not because they don't want insurance. Rather, they don't have a coverage option that fits both their needs and their ability to pay.All that is about to change.The Labor Department recently rolled out a new rule on association health plans (AHPs) that will allow small businesses and the self-employed to act within the same, flexible health care rules as a large business.AHPs allow small businesses and the self-employed to band together and obtain a health plan as a group. AHPs had previously been allowed based on shared industry.But now AHPs can form based on geographic features, like a common state, city, county or metropolitan area, and across state lines as well. Self-employed individuals without employees, including sole proprietors, can now join an AHP.""Today is a great day for America's franchise job creators and their employees in the fight for high quality, less expensive health coverage,"" said International Franchise Association President and CEO Robert Cresanti when the new rule was finalized June 19.He added that it paves the way ""for franchise businesses to utilize AHPs and make the delivery of products and services more affordable for small business owners, employees and their customers."" He's right.For some, however, the new flexibility is cause for concern, particularly as it relates to potential inequities in care.In practice, flexibility expands choices. Forcing people to pay for benefits they don't want, on the other hand, drives up costs. It can even prevent people from buying insurance at all.Moreover, many of those who join forces to form AHPs will offer generous plans, so they can compete for talent with larger companies offering health benefits.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million Americans, including 400,000 who would otherwise be uninsured, will join an AHP by 2023. Expanding choice this way encourages people to sign up for coverage.With this rule, new businesses will now have the chance to join an AHP. Chambers of commerce can get a plan for their members, and leagues of Uber drivers can form associations and get insurance.There will be more coverage options, enhanced ability to self-insure, less regulatory burden and complexity, and reduced administrative costs. And, as we all know, when there are more consumers and more competition, prices will drop.An AHP group can also now negotiate prices with payers and providers. While they can't charge an individual a higher premium based on pre-existing health conditions, they can base premiums on factors such as age, industry and employee classification.Giving small businesses and self-employed individuals a more even playing field with large businesses also means AHP members will have to play by the same rules. Consumer and anti-discrimination protections will apply.While this rule may not represent sweeping reform, it is a step in the right direction.The Trump administration should continue its progress by adding a final rule to allow for renewal of short-term, limited-duration plans. That's prohibited under current rules.That will bring America closer to the ultimate goal of delivering better health care coverage at lower prices for all.

1123,A,"Diligent stock chart analysis is key to learning how to invest in growth stocks successfully. Those who take the time to learn the ascending base, one of the rarer patterns, will have a better chance of pinpointing new buy points and achieving bigger returns.If identified properly, this base can lead to big gains. While the definition of an ascending base sounds relatively straightforward — three pullbacks amid a series of higher price highs and higher price lows — context matters a great deal.Leading stocks create ascending bases during periods of market weakness. The stock continually hits a new high, but is dragged down by the general market.Ascending bases are typically nine to 16 weeks in duration, starting with the first week down within the first pullback. In ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil notes that the depth of each pullback ranges from 10%-20%. The MarketSmith Pattern Recognition algorithm scans for three pullbacks that correct between 6% and 25% to help compensate for a stock's individual volatility.Small-cap stocks tend to trade with more volatility than large-cap stocks, but both can form these bullish base formations.OpenTable traded under the ticker symbol OPEN before it was acquired by Priceline Group — now Booking Holdings (BKNG) — in 2014 for $2.6 billion.In the first pullback, the online restaurant-reservation service dropped 17% from May 18 to June 8 (1).

1129,A,"China has been gobbling up the world's soybeans at breakneck speed over the past decade. But as the trade spat with the U.S. escalates, its imports of the oilseed are set to decline for the first time in 15 years.China will bring in 95 million metric tons of soybeans in the 2018-2019 season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday in its monthly World Supply and Demand Estimates report. That's down from the USDA's June forecast for 103 million tons and would mean a drop of 2.1% from the prior crop year.Soybean futures for November delivery fell as much as 1.2% to $8.38 a bushel in Chicago after the USDA report was released.China slapped duties on U.S. soybean shipments earlier this month in response to Donald Trump's tariffs. As a result, the Asian country will pay more for the oilseed, slowing its use of soybean meal — a product used to feed hogs. The Asian country could turn to using more of its stockpiles, as the USDA forecasts an 18% decline for China's inventories in 2019.China has been avoiding U.S. soybeans and shifting its purchases to other countries. The changing trade flows and lower consumption will probably drive global soybean inventories up to a record and boost U.S. stockpiles as American shipments drop. Farmers in Brazil, the world's biggest exporter, may boost production in response as China's purchases from the South American country rise, the USDA said.

1131,A,"Businesses are collecting more data than ever before. But only 4% of companies use that data to its full potential, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers and Iron Mountain report. Would you believe that over 20% derive zero value from the information they collect!Beyond boggling the mind, this inefficiency is costing firms millions in revenue.So what gives? Part of the problem is that brands aren't asking themselves the right questions. Obvious questions such as ""Did we over or underperform this month?"" have black-and-white answers. But without a holistic analysis of the company's data, managers won't be able to answer more important questions, such as why their sales or marketing team under- or over-performed.To answer these ""why"" questions, companies need more quantitative experts, equipped with the right tools to analyze large data sets. For the past couple of decades, most companies had these data and skill sets in one centralized business-intelligence function. Today, we are seeing forward-thinking lines of business build this function up inside their own teams. These teams, which we call ""modern intelligence teams,"" put the ""what,"" ""why"" and ""so what"" functions much closer together, enabling brands to take evidence-based actions to improve performance.Can you answer these questions for your brand? Could your brand close more deals if you bundled your products differently? Or if you offered free shipping or flash discounts? What if you did both? What would the impact be if you were to price your best-selling item 10% higher?Answering questions such as these is critical in today's hypercompetitive business environment. PwC says brands can increase their operating profits by almost 9% simply by raising prices on certain products by 1%. And a recent McKinsey survey found that the best performing packaged-goods companies use analytics to adjust shelf prices on a daily basis. The ""winning"" firms in the survey streamlined their decision-making surrounding pricing, promotions and assortment of goods. Consequently, they outperformed their peers' margins by five percentage points.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMaking these decisions takes the right data team — the best ones are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to gain scale. A typical data engineer can only create one or two models a week by herself. With AI and machine learning, she could generate thousands. Predictive models powered by AI and machine learning enable brands to take full advantage of their data and, more importantly, their market opportunities.AI is already helping data scientists spot business opportunities that they would have otherwise missed. Consider the financial services industry. A study by investing site ValueWalk found that, over the past six years, an index of hedge funds that use artificial intelligence generated returns that were three times higher than a competing index of funds that don't use AI.Or consider retail. Macy's tinkers with the prices of over 70 million items in real time by using advanced analytics to pinpoint demand and inventory.Chinese online retailers Taobao and Tmall are both owned by Alibaba Group. During a recent 24-hour sale, the sites used AI to personalize over 6 billion landing pages based on consumer purchase history, gender, age, location and other data. The AI-tailored pages had a 20% higher conversion rate than standard pages.Finally, consider a tech company that jeopardized $1 billion by failing to accurately pinpoint demand. The firm realized that it was relying too much on internal sales and inventory data. So it adopted a consumer-demand model powered by machine learning. The new model, which included web, pricing, search-engine and stock-exchange data, improved prediction analysis by 150%.Much of the data that brands collect is underutilized. By building your analytics function closer to your business, you ensure every department and team has support from data gurus. Brands should invest their resources to ensure every data expert has access to the latest training and technological resources.With a modern intelligence team, brands can improve the way they close sales and win customers by measuring what matters.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1140,A,"As I watch a great number of my fellow Americans and virtually all of the mainstream media descend further and further into irrational and immoral hysteria — regularly calling the president of the United States and all of his supporters Nazis, white supremacists and the like; harassing Republicans where they eat, shop and live; ending family ties and lifelong friendships with people who support the president; declaring their opposition to Trump and the Republican Party the ""Resistance,"" as if they were American reincarnations of the French who fought real Nazis in World War II; and so on — I ask myself: What is going on? How does one explain them?Here are some answers:Many Americans are naive, about life, about good and evil, and about America. They don't realize how rare America is and how good they have it. This mass naïveté was vividly expressed by the reaction of tens of thousands of mostly white middle-class Americans to then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, when he was campaigning in Columbia, Missouri. Obama announced, ""We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.""I frequently play the recording of Obama's statement on my radio show not only to explain a basic difference between right and left — the left believes America needs to be fundamentally transformed, while the right thinks America needs to be incrementally improved — but also for people to hear the crowd's reaction.Very few contemporary American recordings are as depressing as the ecstatic and prolonged cheering the crowd gave that terrible promise from Obama. I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that had he announced a cure for cancer, the cheering could not have been louder and probably would not have been longer.Why would middle-class Americans — people who have more affluence, more opportunity, better health, better health care and more liberty than almost anyone alive in the world today, and certainly than anyone who ever lived — thunderously applaud a call to fundamentally transform their decent country?One answer — one of many, as we will see — is naïveté.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier this year, I had a debate/dialogue with two left-wing students at the University of California, Berkeley. I thought debating left-wing students, rather than giving a speech, would accomplish two objectives: deter left-wing protesters from disrupting my appearance and enable young people at Berkeley and around the world (via the internet) to hear differences between right and left clearly spelled out. Both aims were achieved.My final question to them was ""Do you believe people are basically good?"" Without a moment's pause, both students said yes.I told them they think that way because they live in such a decent country. It is easy to remain naive in America, where most are insulated from the suffering inflicted on so much of humanity in deeply corrupt, poverty-stricken and war-torn societies. Nevertheless, given the way humans have treated one another throughout history, and only two generations after Auschwitz, only the naive can believe people are basically good. And since no Western religion (i.e., any religion based on the Bible) has ever posited that people are basically good, this naïveté is abetted by secularism, which allows for the pursuit of knowledge but destroys wisdom.Only the naive — or willfully ignorant — could equate support for Donald Trump with Nazism. Are most Israeli Jews Nazis? Are a third of America's Jews Nazis? (Many on the left would probably answer yes, which gives you an idea how mean and sick many on the left are.)Boredom, at least in our time, is the most overlooked source of evil. In the past, before people went to college and abandoned religion — the two greatest reasons there is so much moral idiocy in our time — people knew how dangerous boredom was. ""Idle hands are the devil's workshop"" was a commonly used aphorism that wouldn't even make sense to most young people today.By bored I am not referring to a lack of things to do. There is more opportunity to do and experience things today than ever before. By bored I mean a deep boredom of the soul, what the French call ""ennui."" This is the boredom that emanates from lack of purpose and a yearning for excitement.The combination of affluence and secularism produces boredom as surely as the combination of hydrogen and oxygen produces water. Without affluence, people have a built-in purpose: obtaining food and shelter, supporting oneself and one's family, etc. And religion, with or without affluence, likewise has always provided people with meaning. Without religion, therefore, purpose is often lost. Add to that the number of people who are not married and do not have children (also a result of the combination of affluence and secularism) and you remove another universal source of meaning.A disproportionate percentage of those on the left (not traditional liberals) do not lack for material needs, have no religion and are single and/or childless. Those left-wing screamers you see in restaurants, the left-wing mobs on campus, the left-wing ""antifa"" thugs and the left-wing Black Lives Matter demonstrators who close down bridges and highways do not generally consist of married people with children who attended church the previous Sunday.These people find this lack of purpose assuaged by leftism. It provides meaning and excitement, a very heady combination.These are a few explanations.

1143,A,"Last week, I testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on the state of the American labor market. I summarized my message in one sentence: For American workers, the job market has never — or at least seldom — been better. If you don't have a job, go out and get one, because jobs are out there for the taking.Everyone knows the joyous statistics, of the lowest unemployment rate in two decades, the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates in three decades (at least), a record number of Americans today who are working, and 5 million bonuses paid out to middle-income Americans this year.President Donald Trump boasts about the job market almost daily, and deservedly so. Several of the Democrats on the committee kept disparaging the Trump tax reform as the ""tax scam"" for the rich. That was a good sound bite a year ago, but do they still want to stick with that message today when about two-thirds of Americans rate the economy as ""good"" or ""great""? This is called leading with your chin.The good news goes beyond the headline numbers. Almost 800,000 construction, manufacturing and mining jobs have been created since Trump's election. These are the blue-collar and middle-class jobs that had been flat or disappearing for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast week, the National Association of Manufacturers found that 95% are optimistic about the future. More than 4 in 5 in the survey said they plan new investment because of the tax cuts. Wow!The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data show 6 million unfilled jobs and a shortage of workers to fill them. This is the very definition of a tight labor market and will most likely lead to higher wages and bonuses to workers. It is already having this effect. In some parts of the country, employers are paying signing bonuses of up to $25,000 for welders, pipe fitters, engineers and truck drivers.""We've probably never had a situation like we have today, where the demand (for workers) is strong and capacity is constrained,"" says Bob Costello, chief economist of the American Trucking Associations.Finally, the real unemployment rate, the so-called U-6 rate, which includes discouraged workers who have dropped out of the workforce and those who can only find part-time work, has fallen to 8% this year, down from a high of 16% in Barack Obama's first term.Now we need to get more Americans working. The labor force participation rate for those 16 or older dropped from 65.8% at the start of the Obama presidency to just 62.9% at the end of the Obama presidency and is now just creeping up. The biggest challenge is getting young people into the workforce. Older people are working more, and young people are working less. What is wrong with this picture?How do we make an overall great labor market picture even brighter? Here are five reforms that would help workers and grow the economy faster:1) Reinstate the work-for-welfare requirements of 1996, which helped pull Americans out of welfare dependency and into the workforce. These helped reduce welfare caseloads in the late 1990s by half, and those who moved into work generally moved up the economic ladder.2) Create a teen federal minimum wage at $5 to $7 an hour to encourage young workers to get job experience.3) Encourage apprenticeship programs that would give young Americans a ""college degree equivalent"" for successfully learning a useful trade. President Trump has proposed such changes.4) Make the Trump tax cuts permanent, especially the immediate expensing provisions that encourage business capital spending.5) Allow employers to opt out of Obamacare mandates and requirements if they provide lower-cost health insurance coverage to their workers. Obamacare has led to about a $3,000 rise in health insurance premiums, with more hikes expected in 2019 and 2020. These higher insurance costs to employers are crowding out pay raises for workers and thus reducing work incentives.The great American work ethic has not been lost, but it has been eroded by years of dumb government policies that Trump and Congress could and should correct.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1144,A,"The Trump administration has provoked many an eye roll by justifying a threat to impose auto tariffs based on national security, but the North American subsidiary of Toyota (TM) warned Friday that Trump tariffs on autos would actually undermine national security.Other automakers also panned the Trump tariffs. General Motors (GM) warned the Commerce Department that Trump tariffs would ""lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company."" The National Association of Manufacturers said the tariffs would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States.""Any time a company is willing to take issue with Trump's trade policy, there's always a chance of blowback. Harley-Davidson (HOG) experienced that this week with its plan to dodge the European Union's 25% tariff, levied in retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump blasted Harley-Davidson's plan to move production of European-bound motorcycles offshore as waving the ""white flag.""In commenting on the Commerce Department's Section 232 national security investigation of motor vehicles and parts, Toyota Motor North America stressed that it was commenting not on behalf of its Japanese parent, but on behalf of its 37,000 U.S. employees, and the 367,000 workers employed at its suppliers and dealerships in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The company said that overall U.S. auto sales could fall by 2 million cars if automakers pass on the cost of the tariffs. Such a blow would come at an especially bad time for the cyclical auto industry, which ""is entering a period of flat or declining sales,"" after seven years of growth.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Tesla Sales, Trump Trade War, Jobs Data, Fed Minutes: Investing Action PlanThis No. 1-Ranked Oil Stock May Be Primed For New BreakoutBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

1146,A,"Growth stocks with connections to China, e-commerce, consumer spending and technology had a cheery session in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite rallied more than 0.8% and boosted into new high ground for a third straight session.Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed high-growth companies Netflix (NFLX), Etsy (ETSY) and Qualys (QLYS) symbolized an ongoing trend in 2018: institutional investors continue to hunt for innovative companies that are delivering strong increases in earnings and sales. In a bull market, excellent fundamentals often beget excellent stock market performance.While the Nasdaq 100 shot 1% higher to a new high, the S&P 500 rose slightly less than 0.3%. Dairy, department store and specialty retail, superregional bank, wood product, oil drilling and farm machinery firms dropped significantly. The Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower, despite 2-point-plus gains by Walt Disney (DIS) and market leader UnitedHealth (UNH). The NYSE composite edged fractionally lower, falling for a third straight session.Volume edged mildly higher on the Nasdaq vs. Wednesday and slipped nearly 7% on the NYSE, according to early data. Friday will see monthly and weekly options expire, which sometimes results in unusually heavy volume.A day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year, institutions jumped back into the U.S. Treasury bond market, buying with fury. On the long end, the benchmark 10-year yield fell 4 basis points to 2.94%.Meanwhile, the ECB signaled that it's ready to curtail its own form of quantitative easing and initiate a hike in interest rates sometime in the summer of 2019.French and German equities rallied sharply earlier in the day. The CAC 40 gained 1.4%; Germany's DAX 100 advanced 1.7%.Netflix, one of those rare growth stocks able to lead the upside in more than one secular bull run, jumped another 3% on Thursday and reached a new session high of 395.03.At that price, Netflix has scored a 27% profit for those who bought shares at a prime follow-on entry point near 311 during the final week of April. The gain triggered a key sell signal in which one should take many gains at 20% to 25% from a breakout point.Selling winners on the way up frees up cash in the portfolio for future new buys. Also, many great stocks will take a pause and correct significantly in price after they break out and notch strong double-digit gains.Why was the 311 price level a valid buy point for Netflix?After its breakout from a three-month cup without handle at 204.48 in early January this year, Netflix rallied valiantly, then tested buying support at the 10-week moving average for several weeks during the market's second intermediate correction that began in late March.After a solid breakout from a base, the first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average (as seen on a weekly chart) or the 50-day moving average (on a daily chart) can offer a secondary buy opportunity.The online video streaming giant and pioneer joined IBD Leaderboard initially in July 2014.Etsy vaulted more than 26% to 41.65 in huge volume and at one point rallied 35% intraday. At 41.65, the online marketplace for artists and small businesses has climbed more than 40% since rebounding off the 50-day moving average in late May.The Brooklyn-based company announced an increase in transaction fees for sellers.The Street expects Etsy, also an IBD Leaderboard stock, to grow earnings in the second quarter by 150% to 5 cents a share.Qualys, a security software play, jumped more than 6% to 94.80 in quadruple usual turnover. The stock has now sprinted as much as 14.8% past an 85.10 proper entry point in a seven week cup without handle.The company's revenue rose 22% to $64.9 million in the first quarter, marking a quarterly best.That 22% increase also marked a third quarter in a row of growth acceleration, or a bigger year-over-year gain vs. the prior quarter.Qualys' top line increased 14%, 17% and 20% in the prior three quarters.Earnings per share have jumped 30%, 41%, 39% and 80% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.

1150,A,"A new threat by President Trump to apply 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imported goods put the U.S. stock market on a slicker path to a potential market correction on Tuesday.

Watch to see if the 350 round number level offers a floor of support. Tesla also now has a nice air cushion above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.For now, Tesla continues to work on a huge base that stretches all the way back to September 2017.

1151,A,"Welcome to the Dow Jones industrial average. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest stock on the blue-chip index, is the worst Dow Jones stock in the first half of 2018.General Electric (GE), which tanked 22% through June 30, is no longer a Dow Jones stock. That leaves Walgreens stock leading Dow laggards, followed by 3M (MMM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Caterpillar (CAT) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Each booked a double-digit loss through June. The Dow Jones index overall fell 1.8% over the same period, lagging a 1.7% advance for the S&P 500 index and an 8.8% gain for the Nasdaq composite.On a brighter note, the best-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2018 so far boast impressive gains.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe retail pharmacist took the Dow Jones seat that the embattled GE vacated Tuesday, but faces deep problems of its own.""Walgreens has struggled to cope with a rapidly changing pharmaceutical market with pressured reimbursement, massive consolidation, and increasing competition for prescription volume,"" according to Morningstar.Walgreens Boots Alliance faces increasing and direct competition from grocery chains and retailers. On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) agreed to buy PillPack, making a decisive, long-rumored move into the pharmacy space.Walgreens, which reportedly sought the online pharmacy for itself, tumbled on the news, along with other drug stores and other pharmacy-related stocks.Walgreens stock peaked in January, then sank after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) struck a healthcare partnership. The move potentially threatens Walgreens, which also manages prescription-drug plans and provides health care to store customers.But the pharmacy chain now counts on roughly 10,000 stores — after acquiring thousands of Rite-Aid (RAD) locations — to return to earnings growth.Shares of Walgreens dived 17.4% in the first six months of 2018.Industrial conglomerate 3M must reckon with a continued shift away from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, analysts say.That macroeconomic trend coincided with a severe downturn in its key power market. The company may now sell its gas-turbines unit, after earlier shedding rail, wind and health assets.3M stock sank April 24 after the company lowered its 2018 earnings guidance. It has yet to recover, sitting 26% below a January high of 259.77.Talk of trade wars and steel tariffs also contributed to the decline. Roughly 60% of 3M's revenue comes from abroad.But the company, well regarded for its R&D expertise, continues to scout for growth. It capitalized on automakers' quest to build profitable electric cars by announcing in June that it will invest in a battery factory.Shares tumbled 16.4% in the first half of this year.A household name, P&G's tepid top-line growth has come amid massive shifts in the consumer goods sector.Consumers increasingly choose niche, alternative brands over well-known names, while groceries and supermarkets have shifted from branded products toward more upscale, private labels. The Amazon-Whole Foods deal is set to further disrupt grocery aisles.This multinational also faces intense competition from local companies in emerging markets.However, P&G scored a victory in a recent proxy fight with Trian Fund Management. The Nelson Peltz fund wanted this Dow giant to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy products.P&G shares dropped 15% in the first half of 2018.Caterpillar's woes just grew beyond volatile commodity prices, an uncertain outlook for global infrastructure and construction spending — and loose-lipped execs.It's among companies that face potentially higher negative impact from a Trump trade war that is expanding in scope and reach, research firm CFRA said last week.Caterpillar, a top construction and equipment maker, operates around the globe. China's crackdown on emissions is a potential headwind, but there are other risks.""As urbanization slows or Chinese central planners decide to de-emphasize construction, Caterpillar's resources business could suffer,"" analysts at Morningstar say. But they add restructuring efforts are starting to pay off and heavy equipment demand is starting to recover.Caterpillar stock tanked 6% April 24 after its CFO described Q1 operating margins as a ""high watermark"" for the year. The company later tried to walk back those remarks, but the damage was done.Caterpillar stock lost 13.9% in the first half of this year, with losses accelerating in the last few weeks.The investment banking giant saw trading activity roar back to life in the first quarter, helped by market volatility. But Goldman Sachs stock skidded in March after reports of CEO Lloyd Blankfein's looming departure. Losses accelerated in April after management shared plans to put share buybacks on hold.Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve let most U.S. banking giants announce big stock buybacks and dividend hikes after passing the second round of stress tests. But Goldman and investment bank peer Morgan Stanley (MS) will have to keep shareholder payouts around current levels due to a capital shortfall.Bank stocks, in general, have suffered recently from a flattening yield curve and ebbing consumer confidence. Their 2017 rally, fueled by tax overhaul and rising rates, seems a distant memory now.In May, Goldman Sachs analysts said Amazon (AMZN) has an ""opportunity to expand in financial services,"" but is unlikely to launch a standalone bank.This Dow Jones stock sank 13.4%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Futures Rise With These 2 Tech Titans In Buy ZoneStock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What Can You Expect?If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average And What Does It Measure?

1152,A,"Tesla stock jumped, then fell Monday after the maker of electric vehicles said it hit the target for Model 3 production that Chief Executive Elon Musk said was critical for the company to reach profitability.XTesla (TSLA) on Sunday said it produced 5,031 Model 3 vehicles in the last week of the second quarter, inching past its goal of 5,000 vehicles for the first time. It also built 1,913 Model S and Models X vehicles, hitting its projections.Tesla built a total of 53,339 vehicles in the second quarter. That's a 55% increase from the first quarter, ""making it the most productive quarter in Tesla history by far,"" the company said in the Tesla Model 3 announcement.Shares of Tesla closed at 335.07, down 2.3% on the stock market today. Tesla stock was up as much as 6% during early trading.As to whether the Model 3 production rate is sustainable, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak says not yet, due to employees working overtime and requiring extended production under tents.""The efforts taken (tent, overtime) represent a burst rate, not a yet sustainable pace,"" Spak wrote in a research note to clients. He has a sector perform rating and price target of 280.Also potentially complicating matters for Tesla is that its senior vice president of engineering, Doug Field, is leaving the company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Field took a leave from Tesla in early May, but the company at the time said it was not a resignation.Tesla stock finished June with a 20% gain in share price, its best monthly performance in almost four years, according to Bloomberg.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe company expects to increase production to 6,000 Model 3s per week by late next month.""We also reaffirm our guidance for positive GAAP net income and cash flow in Q3 and Q4, despite negative pressures from a weaker U.S. dollar and likely higher tariffs for vehicles imported into China as well as components procured from China,"" the company said.Reaching profitability is also critical for Tesla to avoid adding to its heavy debt load of $10.4 billion. Musk has repeatedly said the company would not have to raise cash this year.The company is spending cash at a hefty clip, which recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. Tesla's cash burn and debt load are among the reasons it's one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street.Musk has said he plans to double Model 3 production to 10,000 as it adds a third production line at its Fremont, Calif., manufacturing plant.While it produced 53,339 vehicles, Tesla said it delivered 40,740 vehicles. Of those, 18,440 were Model 3, 10,930 were Model S, and 11,370 were Model X.Wall Street was divided on whether Musk and Tesla could pull it off. To reach its goal Tesla added to its manufacturing line by building cars temporarily under a tent.Importantly, Tesla said the Model 3 reservations count at the end of the second quarter still stood at roughly 420,000. That was ""even though we have now delivered 28,386 Model 3 vehicles to date,"" the company said.""The last 12 months were some of the most difficult in Tesla's history, and we are incredibly proud of the whole Tesla team for achieving the 5,000 unit Model 3 production rate. It was not easy, but it was definitely worth it,"" Tesla said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Can Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?Tesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetTesla Annual Meeting Reveals China Battery Plant, Teases Model Y Plans

Sarepta stock ended the day at a record high, up 36.8%, at 143.93. In earlier action on the stock market today, shares bounded as high as 176.50.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We note the data was met with gasps, rousing applause, and to add additional drama to the event, the surprise appearance of all three treated children walking to the stage to a standing ovation by the investor/analyst audience,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report to clients.Sarepta presented the data during its R&D Day. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is tied to mutations in the gene that makes dystrophin. Dystrophin is a key protein in muscle fiber integrity and function. The treatment aims to boost the amount of micro-dystrophin in patients' muscles.By one measure, patients reached an average of 38.2%-53.7% micro-dystrophin levels compared to normal levels. This beat the biotech company's guidance for 5%-10% and the 10% analysts expected for a ""potentially successful"" gene therapy, Abrahams wrote.Leerink's Schwartz said 15% micro-dystrophin levels would be a home run and saw north of 50% as possible. But the biotech company beat both viewpoints. This ""should position Sarepta as a leader in this field,"" he said in a report.On another measure, average gene expression — or measuring the ability of a gene to produce dystrophin — was 76.2%. The average intensity of positive micro-dystrophin fibers was 74.5%. Sarepta had guided to 10% positive fibers and analysts predicted 30% would be successful, RBC's Abrahams said.The treatment also cut the levels of creatine kinase by an average 87% at day 60. Creatine kinase is an enzyme associated with muscle damage. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy generally have high levels of the enzyme. A fourth patient had his level drop to almost normal, analysts said.Sarepta noted there were no serious adverse events in the study. Two patients had elevated levels of an enzyme that can cause damage to the liver or bile ducts. Physicians increased patients' steroid levels to resolve the issue. Doctors also treated increased nausea with steroids.""Wrapping up the presentation, the three boys marched up to the front of the room to a standing ovation,"" JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko said in a report. She also noted ""a video of boys showed improved stair climbing and running.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

1186,A,"It seems that everything is going the energy sector's way.The price of oil is trending higher, and the sector is expected to blow the doors off second-quarter earnings. Energy companies on the whole are expected to expand earnings 139.8% in Q2 as the sector continues to emerge from a two-year earnings recession, according to research firm CFRA.Indeed, many companies' earnings are still coming up against easy year-ago comparisons. For example, the consensus estimate for Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) EPS of 693% growth compares against a profit of just 15 cents a share in Q2 of 2017.Crude is the tide that lifts all oil stocks, and the price of U.S. oil briefly topped $75 a barrel the past week. It was the highest level since November 2014. Major oil-producing countries are keeping supplies from swelling, and supply constraints pop up in Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Meanwhile, producers continue driving down costs.Among IBD's industry groups, only U.S. exploration and production is in the top 20 of 197 groups. Drilling is No. 57.Energy's expected profit growth is far above any other sector. The second-best sector is materials, with a projected growth of 29.6% thanks to higher commodity prices and higher volumes, says Lindsey Bell, CFRA investment strategist.Financials and information technology are forecast to grow profits 22.7% and 21.3%, respectively. The other seven S&P sectors are estimated to lag the S&P 500's overall profit increase.Technology remains the market's big profit engine. It's headed for the seventh quarter in a row in the top three sectors and the eighth quarter with double-digit growth, Bell notes. Telecommunications is seen rising 15.2%, industrials 14.1%, consumer discretionary 13.4%, health care 9.9% and consumer staples 7.4%. Real estate and utilities are the only sector indicated to decrease Q2 earnings, down 3.8% and 1.5%.For the entire S&P 500, CFRA sees another strong quarter of 19.5% growth. Historically, quarterly growth ends up 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than initial estimates. That might put final earnings up 23%, on par with the 23.3% increase recorded in the first quarter.""We expect this will be the second quarter in a row for earnings growth of greater than 20%, something that hasn't been recorded since 2010 (a result of a rebound in earnings off recessionary declines),"" Bell wrote in a June 28 report. ""This time the robust growth rate is a reflection of strong sales growth and reduced tax rates from the new tax policy.""Revenue for the S&P 500 is expected to increase 8.9%. Materials is forecast to grow sales 30.3%, energy 19.7%, health care 14.7% and technology 11.4%. Consumer staples and utilities are the only sectors expected to report a decline in sales.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70

1192,A,"Over the last three months, the best mutual funds have been buying shares in medical stocks like Abiomed (ABMD), Boston Scientific (BXS) and UnitedHealth (UNH). They've also continued to go shopping for retailers like Macy's (M), Dollar General (DG) and T.J. Maxx parent TJX (TJX).Seventy stocks made the latest list of new buys by the top performing funds in the past three months. Twelve hail from the medical sector, while 11 come from the retail industry. As noted last month, leading fund managers have been showing renewed interest in brick-and-mortar retailers like TJX, Macy's, Kohl's (KSS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW), all of which also earned a spot on the latest list.Nineteen mutual funds scooped up an estimated $33 million of shares in fellow retail sector stock and car-auction firm Copart (CPRT). The IBD 50 stock was recently added to the S&P 500, replacing Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFive stocks garnered over $100 million each in new investments by the top funds. Adobe Systems (ADBE) (26 funds invested approximately $255 million) and UnitedHealth (32 funds, $230 million invested) topped the list.Railroad giant CSX (CSX), building products retailer Grainger and medical products makers Abiomed and Boston Scientific also joined the $100 million-plus club.Given the recent volatility in the general market, it's not surprising that several stocks on the list are testing support or forming new chart patterns. Adobe, Macy's, Copart, CSX, Abiomed and several others are testing their 10-week moving averages. See if fund managers step in to protect and add to their positions at that bench mark line. After successfully testing support at its 10-week line, UnitedHealth has bounced back into buy range.Discount retailer Dollar General is working on an early stage consolidation showing a 105.92 buy point. The stock's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio further indicate demand for shares.TJX, which operates over 4,000 T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Marshalls and Sierra Trading Post stores, has been trading within a very narrow price range. A break above the peak in that formation in heavy volume could offer an add-on buying opportunity.Specialty paint manufacturer RPM International (RPM) bolted past a 56.79 entry on June 28. The move came as the company announced a new deal with Elliott Management to boost efficiencies and shareholder value. RPM has managed to hold the bulk of those gains.Electronic components maker Kemet (KEM) recently jumped past a 25.79 entry in a deep and later-stage cup with handle. The IBD 50 stock went on a massive run from a low of 1.34 in February 2016 to a high of 27.35 in October 2017. After a sharp decline following that move, Kemet has rebounded and now sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 up/down volume ratio. Note how the 10-week line is now back above the longer-term 40-week moving average — a sign of renewed technical strength. Kemet is now out of buy range.Oil and gas stock Rowan (RDC) topped the list of stocks being sold with 14 net sellers (19 funds selling minus five buying). Vishay Intertechnology (VSH), which makes transistors, diodes and capacitors, was the only other stock in double-digits, with 10 net sellers (16 selling minus six buying).Despite that selling, Vishay has shown resilience. The stock remains 16% above a recent 22 buy point.

1193,A,"While the Trump trade war has created plenty of fear in financial markets — the Dow Jones fell for an eighth straight session Thursday — companies haven't had much to say about what it means for them. That's likely to change during second-quarter earnings calls starting early in July. The news is likely to be negative.""With the trade war expanding in scope and geography, while moving from rhetoric to action, we expect companies to update and increase the potential negative impacts from tariffs during upcoming second-quarter earnings calls,"" CFRA Research analyst Elizabeth Vermillion wrote in a Thursday note.She cited Dow Jones industrial average component Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Fastenal (FAST) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) as among the companies that likely face a negative Trump trade war impact but have yet to disclose it. Investors, however, may already be pricing in at least some impact of the Trump trade war. On Thursday, shares of Caterpillar slipped 2.2%, falling for a seventh straight session. Meanwhile, Deere lost 1.4%, Fastenal 3.3% and Stanley 2.1%.During first-quarter earnings season, President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum had yet to apply to Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Trump lifted exemptions from the 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs effective June 1. Further, potential tariffs aimed at Chinese high-tech imports were still in the process of being detailed. Now 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports have a July 6 due date, and Beijing has made clear it plans to match them, dollar for dollar, with tariffs on U.S. goods. On Friday, European Union retaliatory tariffs kick in.German industrial giant Daimler (DDAIF) warned late Wednesday that Chinese tariffs on its U.S.-built Mercedes-Benz SUVs would hit earnings. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% Thursday to their lowest since December 2016.While it's possible that the Trump trade war vs. China may be over before it really begins, uncertainty over Trump's sanctions reprieve for Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE may stall negotiations until after the July 6 date for tariffs to begin.Even the tariffs on Chinese imports may have a direct negative impact on U.S. corporate earnings. An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the bulk of those tariffs would apply to goods produced in China by multinationals based in the U.S. and countries other than China.Meanwhile, steel and aluminum prices have been on the rise. Labor Department data show that prices for steel mill products rose 4.3% in May, on top of a 3.2% April increase, even before Trump ended most exemptions. Aluminum prices rose 5% last month, following April's 1.8% rise.""While we see increased risks heading into the second-quarter earnings period, we continue to believe that fundamentals (for industrial machinery producers and distributors) are solid,"" Vermillion wrote.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot Tech Makes Bullish Move Toward Buy Point, Defying Sell-OffThe Big Picture: 30 Reasons Why Nasdaq Keeps Flogging The Dow Jones Industrial AverageStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

1195,A,"Russia Investigation: After Congress threatened impeachment, the Department of Justice and FBI reluctantly handed over classified documents related to the Russia investigation. But they still haven't fully complied with Congress' request. Is this just more deep-state obstruction?Of course, that's a loaded question. Sure, the bureaucrats at DOJ and the FBI have a responsibility to keep the nation's secrets and to maintain the integrity of their own investigations. But they don't have a right to hold back information legitimately requested by Congress for its investigation into the highly questionable behavior of both the DOJ and FBI during the Russia-Trump investigation.""A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said Saturday that the department (of Justice) has partially complied with subpoenas from the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees after officials turned over more than a thousand new documents this week,"" the Associated Press reported.It's that phrase ""partially complied"" that sticks in our throat. Imagine ""partially complying"" with a judge's order to tell the whole and complete truth in a court case. Or ""partially complying"" with your requirement to file you taxes. Or ""partially complying"" with a police officer's lawful order to stop.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Partial"" compliance isn't enough. Congress has repeatedly requested documents for its investigation, but has been denied. And we need to be absolutely clear here: Congress has oversight authority over both the Justice Department and FBI. So saying ""No"" to Congress' request, unless it's grounded in serious national security concerns, is not acceptable. Period.Try impeding an investigation by DOJ or the FBI and you'll immediately be charged with obstruction or worse, with the possibility of going to prison for many years. Why should DOJ and the FBI be exempt from the law?Some in Congress aren't happy about all this. Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina is one of them.""New reports of DOJ-FBI compliance with document requests are NOT accurate,"" he tweeted. ""While they have turned over additional documents, the new documents represent a small percentage of what they owe.""""The notion that DOJ/FBI have been forthcoming with Congress is false,"" he wrote.The problem is, Congress needs to get to the bottom of what looks to be a massive conspiracy within the FBI and DOJ to boost Hillary Clinton's election chances, while impeding Trump's. If true, and certainly evidence amassed so far indicates it is, it would be the biggest government scandal in at least 100 years. Bigger, yes, than Watergate.That's why Congress has sought so much documentation from FBI Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein. They demand more than 1.4 million documents, a large amount to be sure, but have only received roughly 800,000 pages. Last week's delivery amounted to just 1,400 pages or so. So you can see why some investigation-minded representatives, such as Meadows, aren't satisfied.The Justice Department and FBI had a Friday deadline to hand over the documents. They only partially complied. Yet the vow by Rep. Devin Nunes ""there's going to be hell to pay"" if they didn't comply seems to have fallen on deaf ears.The questions about the Russia investigation launched by the FBI and later picked up by Special Counsel Robert Mueller are many.Congress, for instance, wants access to transcripts of conversations between ""confidential human sources"" — spies — and Trump campaign officials.Congressional Republicans also seek to understand how former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled the now-infamous Trump dossier, came to be paid by the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the FBI. Collusion, anyone?And they also want to look into how the FBI and DOJ used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on the Trump campaign.These are all legitimate issues. Stonewalling is an old strategy. Maybe the deep state is hoping for a Blue Wave in November to get Congress off its back.Regardless, whether the U.S. remains a healthy, law-abiding republic or sinks to the level of other nations now ruled by corrupt elite bureaucracies is what's at stake here. Who decides what gets handed over — a group of unelected bureaucrats, or the representatives of the American people?Americans deserve answers. They should demand them.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeRussia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?Sorry, But Obama White House, Not Dossier, Was Behind Trump InvestigationClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

The company is in a race against time as its advantages over other automakers are shrinking.""Ramping high volumes of the Model 3 is crucial, in our view, yet our comprehensive checks point to substantial manufacturing problems, particularly at the battery cell level, module assembly and factory automation lines,"" Gill wrote in his report to clients.He added: ""We don't foresee Tesla reaching full production until 12 months from now. If the company does manage to hit its production targets, we suspect it will be by sacrificing margins and profitability.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe company's profitability depends highly on the success of its Model 3 production. Recently, the company said it's producing more than 2,000 cars a week. It continues to target a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the third quarter, according to a first-quarter vehicle production report on April 3.""Our checks indicate that Tesla probably won't get to 2,500 per week on a sustainable basis (not just for a week) until the third quarter and we don't foresee 5,000 per week until the second quarter of 2019,"" Gill said. A big problem is battery production. Gill believes it's currently unable to produce batteries at the rate it needs to reach production goals.Long term, many of the comparative technological advantages in electric vehicles will continue to shrink, he said.But Tesla's decision to manufacture battery cells internally has proven to be significantly challenging. Competitors are catching up, said Gill. That's also true of Tesla's advantages in materials, thermal cooling systems, battery management and self-driving technology""We believe the decision to manufacture its battery cells and battery packs internally, rather than buying them from Panasonic as Tesla did with the Model S and Model X, has proven to be more challenging than the company anticipated,"" Gill wrote.Overall, he said, the company's stock price does not sufficiently reflect current risks. Comparing Tesla's valuation to other technology companies, he sees an upside case of 370 per share, or up nearly 27%. The downside case is 149, a drop of almost 49%.Shares of Tesla gained 2.5% to close at 291.82 on the stock market today.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk recently announced a ""thorough reorganization"" in a memo to employees. That news coincides with a broader exodus of top executives.Further, the company might need to raise more than $10 billion in capital by 2020 to fund operations and expansion, said a recent Goldman Sachs report, despite Musk's contention that the company won't need to increase its debt this year.

1204,A,"Allergan's (AGN) blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, could outperform expectations this year, an analyst said Monday as she boosted her price target on the stock.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler raised her price target on Allergan stock to 194 from 176, though she kept her neutral rating. Koffler cited bullish views for Restasis sales in 2018 and longer-term expectations for Botox and Vraylar, a depression drug. But, there are still unknowns for other drugs, she said.""The stock has been edging higher and we pulled the model out an additional three years 2025 to assess if we are missing something in the story,"" Koffler said in a report to clients. ""Indeed, we found additional value, especially if management can remain disciplined about (operational expenses).""Koffler expects Restasis sales to be $278 million, $264 million and $136 million for the next three quarters. That tops the Street view for $247 million, $165 million and $87 million, respectively. Restasis increases the eyes' ability to produce tears in patients with chronically dry eyes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRestasis sales likely will be durable from May through July, she said. If that comes to fruition, Allergan may increase its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Botox sales look strong longer term and Vraylar could grab approvals to treat more forms of depression.After 2018, Koffler's model lags the consensus which is likely running on the assumption the firm can grow at a 5% compounded annual rate from 2017-22. But Koffler sees only 2% growth over that time period. She has conservative views on Allergan's pipeline and international segment.Koffler doesn't ascribe any value to Allergan's ability to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a form of liver disease. She also has modest expectations for new eye drugs and a treatment for a digestive disorder. Further, the consensus may be missing patent cliffs for two drugs in 2021-22.Investors could be open to management turnover and restructuring attempts. Koffler, though, worries that Allergan could engage in risky mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, she sees Allergan's efforts to sell its women's health and anti-infection units as neutral to its valuation.""However, we don't expect the company to be acquired and there is still significant uncertainty about capital deployment, and whether management will pursue risky or expensive (mergers and acquisitions) or opt for a more conservative debt repayment strategy,"" she said.If Allergan goes the more conservative route for debt repayment, ""we could see an additional bump in the stock,"" she said.On the stock market today, Allergan rose 1.3% at the closing bell, to 176.84.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

1210,A,"The late-night hosts hate President Donald Trump, so the idea that they would make friendly alliances shouldn't be shocking. But as we've come to understand, in today's world anything that reflects negatively on this president becomes ""news."" So when Stephen Colbert at CBS called up Jimmy Fallon at NBC and Conan O'Brien at TBS for a joint mockery of Trump, the liberal media jazzed up its importance.Vanity Fair called it a ""Historic Group Chat,"" as if these were world leaders in arms negotiations. Entertainment Weekly hyped them as superheroes engaging in an ""Avengers-esque collaboration."" CNN senior media reporter Brian Stelter led his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter with the headline ""Late night collusion!""This underlines how liberals elevate late-night comedians and ""Saturday Night Live"" satirists as the smartest, greatest Americans, an honor they don't deserve.

""Choking up,"" the Reporter writes, Fallon said: ""I heard you. You made me feel bad. So now what? Are you happy? I'm depressed. Do you want to push me more? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself?""Comedians are expected to do the left's bidding like pop-culture guerrillas. The agitators apparently driving Fallon to brink of suicide threats never minded when Fallon fawned all over Hillary Clinton.In 2012, he hosted then-President Obama for a segment of ""Slow Jam the News"" during which he let Obama push his agenda and then endorsed it, saying: ""Awww, yeah. You should listen to the president, or as I like to call him, the preezy of the United Steezy."" In 2013, Fallon dressed up as a woman and partnered with then-first lady Michelle Obama for a skit called the ""Evolution of Mom Dancing.""All is apparently right with the world when the networks work overtime to confirm the ""effortless"" coolness of Democratic leaders. But Republicans can never be normalized or humanized by late-night hosts.When Johnny Carson mocked President Ronald Reagan, it was gentle and had a ""just kidding"" vibe. All these years later, the left expects late-night comedians to lead a vicious campaign of character assassination to ruin Trump, which is why Fallon's hair mussing gets metaphorically reimagined as treason.Other columns by L.

Both authors are principals with professional services network giant Deloitte.""We have recently entered into an era when lessons of the past seem no longer to provide effective guidance,"" Tuff said. Best practices in many companies have become ""bad habits, and they may create blinders to impending disruption. To survive and thrive in a digital era, companies need to blow up the playbooks of the past in order to build something new and better.""Tips on knowing when and how to shake things up:Trigger new perspectives. The average life span of a company listed in the S&P 500 in the early 1960s was about 60 years. Today, it's under 20.This is partly because those once-successful companies clung on to their tried-and-true methods that worked well before. Instead they should have brought ""a beginner's mind to the challenge,"" Tuff said. ""Ironically, the best way for any company to stave off disruption from startups and unforeseen competition is to approach its business as if it is the underdog rather than the incumbent — and to continually refresh and renew.""Microscope status quos. Regularly ask: How does your company do things? How do you approach the competition?""Then you need to figure out which orthodoxies are legit,"" Tuff said. ""Some will need to exist: There are good regulatory and safety reasons that some playbooks need to remain sacrosanct. But not many will pass the test.""When you have a hunch an orthodoxy might be challenged, ask: What would it look like if we didn't do things that way? Do we see evidence of companies — in our industry or elsewhere — that don't follow the same rule?""Embrace differences. Whether in hiring or promotions, leaders often ask, ""Does this person fit in?""

""When Catchafire founder and CEO Rachael Chong is deciding who to hire, she gives candidates problems the organization has struggled with or is currently facing.

Experience provides confidence to make quick decisions on the toughest problems, Gino says. ""But a narrow focus on what we already know cuts us off from all we have left to learn, hindering creativity,"" she added.An example she uses: In January 2009, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger had 208 seconds to make a decision after his plane was disabled by a flock of geese. ""Landing at the nearest airport was the most obvious answer,"" she said. ""But he put aside more than 30,000 hours of flying experience and kept an open mind.""Sullenberger quickly determined he'd never make it to an airport and instead made a daring water landing in the Hudson River.Shake things up. Stability can be overrated, Gino says.Whether in leadership or work it's easy to fall into ""comfortable, almost mindless routines,"" she added. ""That pattern allows people to make predictions about the future — to know how work will look tomorrow.""People find more joy in work when they are allowed and encouraged to come up with better ways of getting things accomplished. As a result, they are engaged, and the data show ""they are more than three times as creative as their disengaged counterparts, and perform 20% better than them,"" Gino said.

1214,A,"Trade: First, President Trump hit China, Canada, Mexico and the EU with trade tariffs. Now, the world is hitting back. Will a burgeoning trade war with our closest trading partners be the undoing of global free trade and Trump's own domestic agenda? Don't count on it.Here's the action so far: President Trump already slapped 10% to 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. In retaliation, Canada has hit U.S. imports with an estimated $12.6 billion in tariffs in retaliation.Next, some $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are set to go into effect later this week, which China vows will not go unanswered.Meanwhile, Trump is also threatening tariffs on European Union autos, a severe sore spot for the EU. It says it will levy $300 billion in tariffs on U.S. autos and other goods — that's not a misprint — if Trump's tariffs go into place.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd Trump has taken it even a step further. As Axios reports, the White House has even threatened to push legislation to ""blow up"" the World Trade Organization by getting rid of its two most basic rules: One, the ""Most-Favored-Nation"" principle, under which all countries in the WTO get the same tariff treatment as others; and, two, ""Bound Tariff Rates,"" under which already-negotiated tariff ceilings can't be removed unilaterally.This might sound like a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but it isn't. Most of the world's tradable goods come under WTO rules. Eliminating the rules overnight would be destabilizing to the world economy, to say the least. It's one of the big reasons why global financial markets have been on such a roller-coaster ride in recent months.Major U.S. companies (like Harley-Davidson), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and even some Senate Republicans — usually allied with Trump on most issues — have issued strong denunciations of Trump's tariffs and plans to exit the WTO.But if Trump worries about the reactions from Congress and overseas, he doesn't let on. He promised explicitly to raise tariffs during his election campaign. And if Trump has shown Americans anything since entering office in January of 2017, it's that he's dead-set on keeping his promises.""Any country that devalues their currency to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies that can't compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating,"" Trump said in 2016.So, yes, Trump is serious about tariffs. But what's also clear is that any extreme moves on trade can by stymied in Congress.There's already a move afoot in the Senate, led by Republicans Bob Corker and Pat Toomey and Democrat Michael Bennet to get rid of Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. They'll stand on solid legal ground. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the White House, power to regulate trade, including tariffs.Moreover, Congress approved of the creation of the World Trade Organization. So pulling out of the WTO or changing it beyond recognition would require Trump to win a vote in Congress.It ain't going to happen.So what's Trump's aim here? Trump isn't just tariff-happy. And he doesn't just hate the WTO to hate the WTO. There's an endgame he has in mind.So what is it? He wants nothing more than for other countries that have highly favorable trade deals through the WTO and U.S. trade agreements to level the playing field a bit. Ultimately, if the gambit works, free traders should be happy. It will actually make trade freer and fairer, rather than treating obsolete trade agreements as if they were an eternally fixed part of Mosaic law.Andy Puzder, who served as CEO of CKE Restaurants for 16 years, explained the dynamic in a recent opinion piece.""With a trade deficit over $500 billion running in their favor, we need to create incentives for our trading partners to renegotiate our current relationships,"" Puzder wrote. ""That's because nations — like people — rarely give up economic benefits they've grown used to having simply because doing so would be fair. They operate in their self-interest.""As noted, the WTO has quite effectively lowered average overall tariffs and trade barriers on many goods and services. It's been a huge success in that respect. But deals made through the WTO have also frozen in place existing unfair advantages that the U.S. agreed to give to Europe, Asia, Mexico and others to help develop their economies.It was a noble act, one for which our major trade partners give the U.S. little or no credit. Last year the U.S. had an overall goods deficit of $810 billion, an enormous amount. That was reduced to an overall deficit of about $568 billion, thanks to exports of services and high-tech. Whether free trade advocates acknowledge it or not, large swathes of the industrial Midwest got decimated by those deficits.Donald Trump promised them relief and hope. He's now keeping that promise, at least rhetorically. Whether tariffs or anything else can ever ""re-industrialize"" the Midwest is an open question.As we've written here many times, we take a back seat to no one on free trade. And we don't like tariffs. Period. They're a tax on consumers and producers. We'd like to see them all go. We believe in truly free trade.That said, highly regulated trade, with tariffs fixed to our disadvantage in semi-perpetuity, cannot be called free trade. That means we need to change past trade deals. That includes NAFTA and the many WTO trade deals that are no longer fair.

1215,A,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and General Motors (GM) headed early gains among automakers. An update from Micron Technology (MU) following a China court ruling on Tuesday, and an analyst upgrade to Qorvo (QRVO) stirred an early advance among chipmakers.The Nasdaq Composite led the early gains, scaling up 0.7% as Micron led the Nasdaq 100. The Dow Jones industrial average launched 0.6% higher, with Walgreens Boots (WBA) and Intel (INTC) heading its early advance.

That was smaller than May's 19.5% increase, and job cuts during the second quarter were 25% below those in the first quarter, and up 4% vs. the second quarter of 2017. Year-to-date through the end of June, announced layoffs ran 8% above 2017 levels.Private, non-farm employers added 177,000 new workers in June, ADP reported in its National Employment Report. The number, often seen as a precursor to the government's official payrolls report due out Friday, was sharply below May's 189,000 new hires. It was also short of the 199,000 added jobs expected by economist consensus. Services-sector employers provided the bulk of the new jobs, with manufacturing adding 16% of June's total.First-time unemployment claims edged higher in the week ended June 30, the Labor Department reported.

China's regulators initially planned to launch their response, with duties targeting $34 billion in U.S. made imports, at 12:01 a.m. Beijing time. That would have effectively imposed tariffs on U.S. goods beginning just after noon, Thursday, on the U.S. East Coast.A statement Wednesday from China's ruling State Council said ""China absolutely won't fire the first shot."" That suggested China would not launch its tariffs until noon, Beijing time, on Friday.The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9%, giving it a 4% loss so far in its seventh-straight weekly decline. The benchmark entered a bear market on June 19. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%, down 2.7% for the week but it has yet to hit the 20% decline from its February high to qualify as a bear market.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slumped 0.8% on Thursday. The index is so far down 3.4% in its third weekly drop.Europe's markets held much of their early gains in afternoon trade.

Netflix shares are extended from a May breakout, consolidating just below a June 21 high.Fiat Chrysler pounded out a 5.9% advance, leading an early rally among automakers. Jeffries & Co. upgraded Fiat to buy, from hold, but lowered the stock's price target to 23, from 26. General Motors jumped 1.6%, spurred by news reports Wednesday that the U.S. and European Union were working on a compromise to the automobile trade tariffs question. Tesla pared an early gain to 0.6%. Ford (F) added 0.6%.Chip stocks showed early strength. Micron surged 3%, Qorvo swun 4.2% higher. Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) notched a 2.1% gain.Micron said a patent-court ruling in China on Tuesday, which barred it from selling certain memory chips and products in the country, would lead to a 1% decline in fourth-quarter revenue. The court ruled Micron had violated patent rights of China-based UMC Technologies (UMC). Micron held its fourth-quarter revenue guidance steady at between $8 and $84 billion. The company said it would comply with China's ruling, while requesting the court ""reconsider or stay its decision.""Micron shares in June dropped more than 8% below a 63.52 buy point following a May 29 breakout. UMC shares rose 3.1% in premarket trade.KeyBanc Capital upgraded Qorvo to overweight, from sector weight, and assigned a price target of 95. A three-week pullback sent Qorvo shares 7.8% below an 83.52 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, stopping just short of the 8% level which would trigger the automatic sell rule.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Dow Futures Aren't On Holiday: Trade War Fireworks Start FridayThe Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In CommonIBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

1220,A,"People hoping to settle in the United States wait years for a green card to be legal residents. They play by the rules. These law-abiding newcomers must feel like idiots, watching what's happening on the southern border.Hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants are walking right in. They're not waiting in line. They're using ""asylum"" requests as their E-ZPass. Just 12% of requests from El Salvadorans, 11% from Guatemalans and 7.5% from Hondurans are actually granted, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Never mind, the request gets them in.It's a shameful distortion of a program intended to provide a haven for true victims of state-sponsored religious, ethnic and political persecution. The U.S. offered asylum to Hungarian anti-communists after their uprising was crushed by the Soviets in 1956; to Cubans fleeing Castro's prisons; to Vietnamese after the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975; to Chinese political dissidents escaping the crackdown after Tiananmen Square in 1989; and more recently, to Chinese Christians and Muslims threatened for practicing their religion.Not to be confused with what's happening on the southern border. Migrants walk up to a border agent with a familiar story. Women typically plead they're victims of an abusive boyfriend or husband, and men claim they're escaping gang violence. They're detained briefly, but many are then released into the United States and given a date for an asylum hearing.Being granted asylum means hitting the jackpot. Asylees get the Refugee Cash Assistance program, including medical care, a housing allowance and hundreds of dollars a month in cash. All inclusive, as the Sandals getaway ads say. In contrast, immigrants who go the green card route are ineligible for most benefits for years.Half who use asylum as their excuse for crossing the border never even file a claim or show up at a hearing. They're also winners. After all, they made it inside the U.S., unlike the East Asian waiting 12 years to enter as a legal worker.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast weekend, open borders advocates held 700 marches across the country, protesting the Trump administration's policies. One target was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recent clarification that domestic abuse is not sufficient grounds for seeking asylum. A few immigration judges have granted asylum on those grounds, but it's not how asylum is defined.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused Sessions of ""staggering cruelty."" But Sessions is right. The asylum law ""is not a general hardship statute,"" he says. If every hardship qualifies for asylum, it will mean everyone can come in.That's the marchers' objective. And increasingly the goal of the progressive flank of the Democratic Party. Their rhetoric suggests any limit on immigration is a crime against humanity. New Yorkers like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who toppled Congressman Joe Crowley last week, and Cynthia Nixon, running to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are calling for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.A similar battle is raging inside the European Union, which is overwhelmed by mostly bogus asylum claims from North African migrants. More than 70% of their claims are rejected, according to special envoy of the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, Vincent Cochetel. But the migrants who are turned down for asylum stay anyway, eluding deportation. They're straining public schools and government benefits and provoking a backlash against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.Last weekend, EU leaders tentatively devised a plan to screen asylum seekers in disembarkation centers along the North African coast, before they make their way across the Mediterranean to Europe. Trump is proposing something similar to vet asylum applicants on the Mexican side of our southern border, before they enter the U.S.In America and Europe, demagogues tell us to have a heart and let everybody in. But the public understands that immigration affects public schools, wages, taxes, even cultural identity. That's why we have immigration laws.The aspiring Americans who obey those laws and wait their turn deserve our respect. Allowing other immigrants to jump in front of them using flimsy asylum claims is a slap in the face.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1225,A,"Taking profits on the way up is a key part of a swing-trading strategy. The biggest problem? The fear of missing out on an even bigger gain. If you can train yourself to take that fear out of the decision, you can stack a number of gains together for a significant boost to your portfolio. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) provides a recent swing trade example.The move in American Eagle Outfitters started with a bullish reversal off the 50-day moving average (1). A bullish reversal can signal that a short-term pullback may be shifting directions. When looking for reversals, we aren't trying to catch the bottom on beaten down stocks. Rather, these are stocks in uptrends already showing relative strength vs. the market. American Eagle Outfitters had a Relative Strength Rating of 94. That means, despite its 12% pullback, it was in the top 6% of stocks in terms of price performance over the last 12 months.Volume was above average on the bounce from the 50-day line and it joined IBD's SwingTrader at 20.72. Two days later and it approached our 5% profit goal (2). We took half profits. Taking half profits on the way up allows you to lock in early gains while still participating if the rally continues. We also typically raise our stop. There is no reason to let a trade turn negative after you have a gain around 5%. We raised the stop to a 1% profit from our entry, in this case 20.93. With half profits booked and a raised stop, you help ensure a profitable trade.For American Eagle Outfitters, the gains continued to stretch and four days after our entry, the stock hit its 10% profit goal (3). With five days up in a row, a break is normal and expected. The market also had a bearish reversal a few days prior so locking in the full gain seemed prudent.Taking profits when they come that quickly can give your money some velocity. String together a number of gains back-to-back and your portfolio can turn in spectacular performance. It compresses the power of compounding into a shorter period. Of course, there's a trade-off. The stock can continue without you. You could be compounding your gain in one trade rather than many. That's the goal of position trading. The benefit of position trading is you can see some big numbers in your individual trades and reduce your transaction costs.In the case of American Eagle Outfitters, the stock did go up from our exit. Briefly. Just a few days later it took a 2.7% hit, putting the price back under our final exit (4). Our swing-trading strategy of taking profits helped optimize our gains for the short period of a week.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesTaking Profits: Swing Trade Example Netted a 15% Gain in 15 daysSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1226,A,"Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) caters to a niche clientele, keeps pushing back the launch of its next product, and trades at a multiple of about 60 times earnings.XTo investors, that might sound like a big ""no thanks.""Yet Wall Street pros laud this veterinary diagnostics company's management as ""brilliant,"" with an ""unbelievable grasp of their business.""""Simply put, the company's execution continues to be second to none,"" Raymond James analyst John Ransom said in a recent note to clients.Ransom went on to say: ""Further, it is not often that a player in any space with dominant (approximately) 60% market share is able to maintain the base in highly competitive markets, yet Idexx posted placement numbers that suggest it could even be gaining share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor one thing, the niche market in question is the veterinary market, one that may sound small in number. There are fewer than 66,000 veterinarians across 31,000 animal health clinics in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Annually, though, vets serve millions of very passionate customers: pet owners. And, well, their pets.About 68% of U.S. households have a pet, according to the American Pet Products Association. That translates to nearly 90 million dogs and more than 94 million cats — not to mention the multitudes of birds, fish and other creatures hanging out in people's homes. Its most recent annual survey reveals that dog owners spent an annual average $731 on routine and surgical vet visits combined. Cat owners shelled out $427.Idexx is the industry leader in supplying vets with the technology to run those in-clinic tests and blood work. It caters primarily to beloved canines and felines in the U.S. and abroad. Like Raymond James' Ransom, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro pegs the company's stateside market share at a hefty 60%.No. 2 player Abaxis (ABAX) has cornered a quarter of the American market, while smaller competitor Heska (HSKA) has about a tenth. VCA unit Antech Diagnostics and Zoetis (ZTS) —the latter of which is acquiring Abaxis — also number among its rivals.Water treatment and livestock products account for a sliver of Idexx's revenue, but the big money comes from its companion animal diagnostics business. That includes a suite of in-clinic products such as chemistry panels, rapid test kits, veterinary instruments and analyzers. There are also external laboratory services such as diagnostic imaging and testing.The companion animal diagnostics unit brought Idexx more than $1.7 billion in net revenue in 2017, or 86.5% of its overall $1.97 billion haul for the year.When a person simply takes a pet to the vet, it is likely to result in Idexx's tests and equipment being used. In the U.S., some kind of diagnostic test is administered about 40% of the time people bring their fluffy friends to the clinic, Idexx said during its investor day presentation last August.Pet owners tend not to object. In fact, millennial pet owners are more likely than their older peers to say ""money is no object to me when it comes to my pets,"" according to Idexx survey work. Forty-one percent of 19- to 36-year olds felt that way, vs. 36% of Gen Xers and 21% of Baby Boomers.As younger people get laser-focused about their careers and wait longer to get married and have kids, ""(they) go out and get the dog at 24, 25,"" years old, said Massaro.Millennials, he said, are ""prioritizing pets over some other things that maybe people from one or two generations ago held in greater esteem.""Idexx's most recent quarter was lauded by analysts, as per-share profit rose 55% to $1.01 a share and revenue grew 16.5% to $538 million, topping views for 93 cents and $526 million, respectively, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company has seen success with SediVue, the industry's first in-clinic urine sediment analyzer. And its recently launched product, Catalyst SDMA, an in-clinic test used by vets to look for kidney disease, was adopted by 42% of its North American customers in the first few months of its debut. Idexx Chief Executive Jonathan Ayers contends that's ""an amazing, amazing accomplishment.""""Nothing happens fast in veterinary,"" he told analysts on the call. ""The adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.""The quarterly beat reinforced Piper Jaffray's bullish call on the companion animal industry, and William Blair analysts said they ""believe the long-term investment merits of Idexx remain very compelling.""""They beat on every single line, every single reference category,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Massaro, adding that ""it gets down to extremely strong commercial execution. (Idexx has) one of the most savvy sales organizations I've ever seen."" He points to the company's unusually large direct sales force — 435 sales reps in North America and more than 100 in Europe — as a particular strength.Shares of Idexx ended trading Thursday down close to 1% to 202.37 but barely remained above a 202.36 buy point. Shares were up marginally on Friday. It broke sharply out of a cup-with-handle base in high volume following the company's earnings report on May 4.Management also lifted its full-year earnings guidance by 2 cents to $4.06 to $4.20 and organic revenue outlook to 10.5% to 12.5% growth on a currency-neutral basis. It reaffirmed its sales outlook, adjusted for exchange rates, at 12% to 14% growth.Even though Raymond James' Ransom had high praise for the company, he only reaffirmed his market perform rating in the same note to clients, citing the high price-to-earnings multiple as a hindrance to a more positive rating.That comes after Idexx has, on more than one occasion, pushed back the launch of its SNAP Fecal Dx, which will allow vets to test, in house, for the presence of hookworm, whipworm and roundworm infections.Canaccord's Massaro brushed off the delay. In his view, that Idexx continues to ""crush their numbers, raise their guide without a product launch coming. (It) tells me and the Street they're beating their numbers.""It's ""startling that Idexx can consistently trade almost three times the premium multiple of other good health care companies,"" said Massaro. For example, Hologic (HOLX), a medical imaging company that he calls the ""undisputed leader in 3D mammography,"" trades at about 19 times earnings (vs. Idexx's 60 times earnings).But Idexx's consistent beat-and-raise quarters and model of nearly 90% recurring revenue — ""unusually high for a health care number"" — bolster his confidence.Idexx's management team has an ""unbelievable grasp of their business,"" he said.William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels believes that the company is ""a durable business franchise that warrants a premium multiple,"" and wrote in early May that the firm ""would be more aggressive with share purchases on pullbacks.""More broadly, Raymond James' Ransom said in April that investors shouldn't expect growth to ramp up in the end-market for companion animal diagnostics. That means shares of companies like Idexx, Abaxis and Heska are ""more likely to move on individual successes (share gains, new product launches, etc.) than to move uniformly on an all-encompassing cyclical dynamic.""But given the baseline growth rate of the animal health diagnostics industry, Canaccord Genuity's Massaro says that means that ""even the worst company in the space would grow 6% to 8%"" each year.""It really is a spectacular industry,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Medtech Stock Breaks Out After Zoetis Snags It For $2 BillionStocks Showing Improving Market Leadership: Idexx Laboratories Earns 84 RS RatingThis Top Medical Stock Breaks Out After Its Beat-And-Raise

1228,A,"Key Trump administration officials have been confronted at restaurants. Rep. Maxine Waters urged protesters to hound Trump officials at restaurants, gas stations or department stores.Progressive pundits and the liberal media almost daily think up new ways of characterizing President Trump as a Nazi, fascist, tyrant or buffoon. Celebrities openly fantasize about doing harm to Trump.What is behind the unprecedented furor?Just as Barack Obama was not a centrist, neither is Trump. Obama promised to fundamentally transform the United States. Trump pledged to do the same and more — but in the exact opposite direction.The Trump agenda enrages the left in much the same manner that ObamaCare, the Obama tax hikes, Obama's liberal Supreme Court picks and the Iran nuclear deal goaded the right.Yet the current progressive meltdown is about more than just political differences. The outrage is mostly about power — or rather, the utter and unexpected loss of it.In 2009, Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation.Democrats controlled the House. They had a supermajority in the Senate. Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDemocrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels. The media, universities, professional sports, Hollywood and popular culture were all solidly left-wing.A Republican had not won 51% of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush's 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis. Before 2016, Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections.And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished.Obama left behind a polarized nation. Democrats lost both the House and the Senate. During Obama's tenure, Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level.Presumptive winner Hillary Clinton blew the 2016 presidential election.Foolishly, Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia. Meanwhile, she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012. Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, elects a president.After his election, President Trump did not implode as predicted. By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders, Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development.Abroad, Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared, bombing ISIS into submission, canceling the Iran deal, seeking to denuclearize North Korea, pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation. Radical improvement in unemployment, economic growth, and oil and natural gas production created new consumer and business confidence.Despite his frequent crudeness, Trump is inching toward a 50% approval rating in a few polls. That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump, and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president.Worse still, much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted.Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013. That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014.Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition, but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term. Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat.In reaction to the sudden loss of political power, Democrats would have been wise to run to the center, as did Bill Clinton, who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans.They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals.Instead, Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election. In Groundhog Day fashion, Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss.To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution, open borders, bigger government and higher taxes, but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn't want.Furious over the sudden and unexpected loss of power, enraged progressives have so far done almost everything to lose even more of it.And that paradox only leads to more furor.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringTurns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsAfter Its Hard Left Turn, Will Democratic Party Officially Admit It's Socialist?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1230,A,"State and local governments are running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.They've promised full pensions to their workers. But they aren't putting aside enough money — or generating high enough returns — to fulfill those future obligations. Soon, they'll have to cannibalize current workers' pension contributions to pay retirees. Young and middle-aged government employees will likely never receive the retirement benefits they're counting on.It's too late to prevent this crisis. But there's still time to mitigate the financial fallout — by trimming benefits, raising contributions, and transitioning younger employees to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans.Most importantly, it's time to recognize that government officials are too short-sighted and underqualified to manage public pensions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor decades, politicians have underfunded public pensions. They've decided to spend tax revenues today, rather than set them aside for future pension liabilities.For instance, between 1985 and 2012, Illinois diverted $41 billion originally earmarked for pension contributions to other priorities. Simultaneously, the state promised increasingly generous retirement benefits to employees — a pledge it had no way of keeping.Today, Illinois' five pension systems face an unfunded liability of $137 billion. Closing that shortfall would require roughly $11,000 from every state resident — including children.Illinois isn't the only offender. According to a recent estimate from the RAND Corporation, state and local government pensions are underfunded by $4 to $6 trillion.  A separate analysis by the American Legislative Exchange Council puts that funding shortfall at over $6 trillion.Governments have masked the severity of the problem by assuming their investments will generate unrealistically high returns.Consider CalPERS, the pension fund for California public-sector employees. The board predicts the fund will earn annual returns of 7% — even though it has averaged just a 4.4% annualized return over the past decade.It is extremely unlikely that CalPERS will come close to its 7% target for the foreseeable future. Asset valuations are already near record highs, which means there's little upside left before an inevitable correction.Even when governments provide adequate funding to pensions, corrupt and incompetent officials often squander it. Consider the current plight of the Dallas Police and Fire Pension fund.It lost $1.5 billion from 2013 to 2016 — largely because the chief administrator invested almost half of the fund's capital in risky private equity and real estate investments.No private pension-fund manager in his right mind would ever take such a high level of risk.The Dallas fund's administrator and several board members spent over $185,000 on extravagant travel in one year chasing risky real estate projects in Napa Valley and Hawaii — just one example of misbehavior that a watchdog group described as pervasive ""absolute corruption.""  Following the scandal, the formerly healthy pension plan was only 45% funded.Government officials have dug themselves — and the workers who trusted them — into a hole. And there's no way out. All we can do now is ease the pain.First, current retirees must tolerate a reduction in benefits. The average pension for a California public-sector worker who retires after a 30-year career is almost $69,000.If that worker started his career in his early 20s and retired in his early 50s, he could easily live long enough to earn more from pension checks than he ever made from his salary.That's not sustainable. It's better to take a haircut now — rather than let pension funds implode and leave retirees with nothing.Second, taxpayers ought to demand that their state and local governments set aside a greater portion of tax revenue for pension contributions. Too often, governments underfund pensions one year and falsely promise to make up the contributions at a later date.Third, the public sector must transition younger employees into defined-contribution retirement plans, such as the 401(k)s common in the private sector. These plans allow employees to manage their own retirement funds, instead of depending on a government pension check that may never come.These reforms will help — but in all likelihood, the federal government will still have to bail out many pension funds. When that happens, taxpayers should kick public officials out of the pension business.After all, these officials have turned pension funds into giant Ponzi schemes.

1238,A,"The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) remains controversial, with public opinion evenly split and many Democrats campaigning on repeal. However, the Democratic critique of the tax cuts has grown increasingly incoherent.The party excoriates the ""tax cuts for the rich"" while trying to tilt them even further to the wealthy. Democrats slam the deficit effect of the tax cuts while working to worsen budget deficits.In addition, they erroneously describe the law as a ""middle-class tax hike"" while proposing policies that would truly raise middle-class taxes.Disingenuous Critique #1: ""Tax Cuts for the Rich""The most aggressive liberal complaint was that the TCJA represented a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In reality, the tax cuts nudged the distribution of federal taxes in a more progressive direction.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe bottom 80% of families had previously paid 33% of all combined federal taxes, yet received 35% of the tax cuts. By contrast, the top one percent had previously paid 27% of all federal taxes, but received just 21% of the tax cuts.Since upper-income earners received a lower share of the tax cuts, their share of federal taxes paid will slightly rise.More importantly, several Democratic governors and legislatures are aggressively building loopholes to expand the TCJA's tax cuts for wealthy families.The TCJA capped the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000 per filer. Given that 88% of SALT benefits went to families earning over $100,000 — and half accrued to the richest five percent of taxpayers — this cap represented a straightforward way to ensure that the rich did not disproportionately benefit from the rest of the TCJA.And yet Democrat-run states such as New York, New Jersey, and California are in the process of rewriting much of their state tax codes to work around this restriction.Approaches include replacing income taxes with employer payroll taxes that would be eligible for the uncapped SALT deduction (which would also reduce lifetime Social Security benefits), and reclassifying individual state and local taxes paid as charitable contributions eligible for a federal deduction. The latter approach will likely be blocked by the IRS.Still, the intention is to cut federal taxes by nearly $650 billion over the decade if all states follow suit. The liberal Tax Policy Center calculates that 96% of the initial benefits would go to the top 20% of earners, and 57% of the benefits would go to the richest one percent. The richest one percent of New Yorkers would triple their benefits from the new tax law.It is brazen, bizarre, and dishonest to slam the TCJA as a ""tax cut for the rich"" while simultaneously trying to expand its upper-income tax cuts by a staggering $650 billion.Disingenuous Critique #2: Soaring DeficitsDuring last year's debate, liberal critics regularly attacked the immorality of passing on $1.5 trillion in new debt to future generations.However, Democratic lawmakers previously enacted legislation with a combined $5 trillion price tag under President Obama, and today are rallying around Sen. Bernie Sanders'  $32 trillion single-payer health care proposal as well as a $12 trillion federal jobs guarantee. These liberal initiatives dwarf the cost of the tax cuts.Furthermore, Senate Democrats have proposed repealing $1 trillion of the TCJA and putting those savings into new spending  (while seemingly retaining a portion of the cuts for middle- and lower-income Americans).A House bill would repeal the entire law and reprogram the savings into college financial aid. In other words, these Democrats have no problem adding $1.5 trillion in red ink — they just wish the package was more tilted towards spending.That by itself does not make Democrats weaker than Republicans on deficits — both parties support adding $1.5 trillion in debt — but it does reveal the disingenuousness of their deficit concerns.It is also noteworthy that, just seven weeks after the TCJA was signed, Democrats teamed up with Republicans on a spending deal that may cost as much as the tax cuts over the next decade.And as described above, state-level Democrats are playing tax accounting games that could reduce federal taxes by an additional $650 billion over the decade. These are not the actions of a party concerned with deficits.Disingenuous Critique #3: ""Middle Class Tax Hike""Even before the tax bills were drafted as legislation, Senate Democrat cries of ""middle-class tax hikes"" earned a brutal ""four Pinocchios"" condemnation from the Washington Post fact checker.When the final TCJA was enacted, the liberal Tax Policy Centercalculated that it will benefit 80% of families and raise taxes for just five percent — with the higher taxes disproportionately affecting the wealthiest one percent. The typical median-income family will save approximately $900 per year, while the average family will save $1,610.Despite this overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., described the tax cuts as a ""cynical one-two gut punch to the middle class"" that would ""raise their taxes."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  called them ""simply theft — monumental, brazen theft — from the American middle-class and from every person who aspires to reach it.""How could anyone describe the TCJA as a middle-class tax hike? By simply ignoring the first eight years of roughly $900-per-year tax relief and focusing only on the $20 tax hike — that's six cents per day — that the median-income family will theoretically face in 2027 if Congress fails to renew the expiring portions of the law.Of course, if your best argument is that the expiration of the tax cuts would harm families, then the obvious solution is to renew them. Instead, House Democrats are rallying around legislation to repeal all of the tax cuts — including those for the middle class.Furthermore, popular liberal proposals such as single-payer health care, a federal jobs guarantee, free college, and a carbon tax would certainly require steep middle-class tax increases in order to fund the programs.Simply put, the Republicans are cutting middle-class taxes while Democrats would force them upwards.The TCJA is certainly not above criticism. Yet Democrats continue to undercut their complaints by trying to double-down on the aspects they claim to oppose the most.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:States Get A Windfall From GOP Tax Cuts, But Will They Return The Money To Taxpayers?Thanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.Turns Out, The Rich Will Pay A Bigger Share Of Income Taxes Under GOP Tax Cuts

1239,A,"It seems that everything is going the energy sector's way.The price of oil is trending higher, and the sector is expected to blow the doors off second-quarter earnings. Energy companies on the whole are expected to expand earnings 139.8% in Q2 as the sector continues to emerge from a two-year earnings recession, according to research firm CFRA.Indeed, many companies' earnings are still coming up against easy year-ago comparisons. For example, the consensus estimate for Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) EPS of 693% growth compares against a profit of just 15 cents a share in Q2 of 2017.Crude is the tide that lifts all oil stocks, and the price of U.S. oil briefly topped $75 a barrel the past week. It was the highest level since November 2014. Major oil-producing countries are keeping supplies from swelling, and supply constraints pop up in Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Meanwhile, producers continue driving down costs.Among IBD's industry groups, only U.S. exploration and production is in the top 20 of 197 groups. Drilling is No. 57.Energy's expected profit growth is far above any other sector. The second-best sector is materials, with a projected growth of 29.6% thanks to higher commodity prices and higher volumes, says Lindsey Bell, CFRA investment strategist.Financials and information technology are forecast to grow profits 22.7% and 21.3%, respectively. The other seven S&P sectors are estimated to lag the S&P 500's overall profit increase.Technology remains the market's big profit engine. It's headed for the seventh quarter in a row in the top three sectors and the eighth quarter with double-digit growth, Bell notes. Telecommunications is seen rising 15.2%, industrials 14.1%, consumer discretionary 13.4%, health care 9.9% and consumer staples 7.4%. Real estate and utilities are the only sector indicated to decrease Q2 earnings, down 3.8% and 1.5%.For the entire S&P 500, CFRA sees another strong quarter of 19.5% growth. Historically, quarterly growth ends up 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than initial estimates. That might put final earnings up 23%, on par with the 23.3% increase recorded in the first quarter.""We expect this will be the second quarter in a row for earnings growth of greater than 20%, something that hasn't been recorded since 2010 (a result of a rebound in earnings off recessionary declines),"" Bell wrote in a June 28 report. ""This time the robust growth rate is a reflection of strong sales growth and reduced tax rates from the new tax policy.""Revenue for the S&P 500 is expected to increase 8.9%. Materials is forecast to grow sales 30.3%, energy 19.7%, health care 14.7% and technology 11.4%. Consumer staples and utilities are the only sectors expected to report a decline in sales.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70

PBF Energy (PBF) also broke out in early April and is up nearly 24% from a 37.11 buy point.IBD's energy sector is up about 5% year-to-date after finishing 2017 barely 1% higher, missing out on most of the S&P 500's 19.4% gain. To be sure, the sector's returns lag software, semiconductors, internet, apparel and other sectors.Energy stocks also are sensitive to the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, which adds an element of risk that is lacking in other sectors. On Friday and Saturday, the energy sector faces potential volatility as OPEC and other major oil producers meet to discuss output targets.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX's performance has roughly correlated with the price of U.S. crude, and both are up almost the same in 2018. The connection to oil prices is a big reason why the ETF has underperformed in the long term. Through the end of March, the ETF was down 10.8%, 7.3% and 3.6% in three-, five- and 10-year periods.The $389.6 million fund has about a 9% gain for the year, and it is finding support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average.

1248,A,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been on a tear lately. After putting in the bottom to its latest base in early April, the veteran chip stock has posted 10 up weeks in a row. It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings soaring 246% to 45 cents a share this year and rising another 33% to 60 cents in 2019.What's powering that solid profitability? Big sales. In the first quarter, Advanced Micro posted a 40% jump in revenue to $1.65 billion. That increase topped growth of 19%, 26% and 21% in the prior three quarters.Q1 gross margin jumped 400 basis points vs. the year-ago quarter to 36%, and the Santa Clara, Calif., company cut its operating expense as a ratio of sales from 33% to 29%.""PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a news release. Advanced Micro is clearly gaining traction in the area of GPUs, or graphics processors. The firm's computing and graphics segment vaulted 95% to $1.12 billion, offsetting a 12% slide in sales in the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business unit.At this point, it would make sense to watch for the stock to take a rest and flash a follow-on entry point. Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks. Those gains enabled the cosmetics giant to rise past a 151.85 buy point in a nicely symmetrical cup with handle.The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.44.Autodesk (ADSK) muscled past a 141.36 buy point in a 14-week flat base that showed a mild correction of 14% from head to toe. The expert in computer-aided design software for manufacturers snapped a six-quarter streak of losses by earning 6 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in April.

By contrast, the top one percent had previously paid 27% of all federal taxes, but received just 21% of the tax cuts.Since upper-income earners received a lower share of the tax cuts, their share of federal taxes paid will slightly rise.More importantly, several Democratic governors and legislatures are aggressively building loopholes to expand the TCJA's tax cuts for wealthy families.The TCJA capped the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000 per filer. Given that 88% of SALT benefits went to families earning over $100,000 — and half accrued to the richest five percent of taxpayers — this cap represented a straightforward way to ensure that the rich did not disproportionately benefit from the rest of the TCJA.And yet Democrat-run states such as New York, New Jersey, and California are in the process of rewriting much of their state tax codes to work around this restriction.Approaches include replacing income taxes with employer payroll taxes that would be eligible for the uncapped SALT deduction (which would also reduce lifetime Social Security benefits), and reclassifying individual state and local taxes paid as charitable contributions eligible for a federal deduction. The latter approach will likely be blocked by the IRS.Still, the intention is to cut federal taxes by nearly $650 billion over the decade if all states follow suit. The liberal Tax Policy Center calculates that 96% of the initial benefits would go to the top 20% of earners, and 57% of the benefits would go to the richest one percent. The richest one percent of New Yorkers would triple their benefits from the new tax law.It is brazen, bizarre, and dishonest to slam the TCJA as a ""tax cut for the rich"" while simultaneously trying to expand its upper-income tax cuts by a staggering $650 billion.Disingenuous Critique #2: Soaring DeficitsDuring last year's debate, liberal critics regularly attacked the immorality of passing on $1.5 trillion in new debt to future generations.However, Democratic lawmakers previously enacted legislation with a combined $5 trillion price tag under President Obama, and today are rallying around Sen. Bernie Sanders'  $32 trillion single-payer health care proposal as well as a $12 trillion federal jobs guarantee. These liberal initiatives dwarf the cost of the tax cuts.Furthermore, Senate Democrats have proposed repealing $1 trillion of the TCJA and putting those savings into new spending  (while seemingly retaining a portion of the cuts for middle- and lower-income Americans).A House bill would repeal the entire law and reprogram the savings into college financial aid. In other words, these Democrats have no problem adding $1.5 trillion in red ink — they just wish the package was more tilted towards spending.That by itself does not make Democrats weaker than Republicans on deficits — both parties support adding $1.5 trillion in debt — but it does reveal the disingenuousness of their deficit concerns.It is also noteworthy that, just seven weeks after the TCJA was signed, Democrats teamed up with Republicans on a spending deal that may cost as much as the tax cuts over the next decade.And as described above, state-level Democrats are playing tax accounting games that could reduce federal taxes by an additional $650 billion over the decade. These are not the actions of a party concerned with deficits.Disingenuous Critique #3: ""Middle Class Tax Hike""Even before the tax bills were drafted as legislation, Senate Democrat cries of ""middle-class tax hikes"" earned a brutal ""four Pinocchios"" condemnation from the Washington Post fact checker.When the final TCJA was enacted, the liberal Tax Policy Centercalculated that it will benefit 80% of families and raise taxes for just five percent — with the higher taxes disproportionately affecting the wealthiest one percent. The typical median-income family will save approximately $900 per year, while the average family will save $1,610.Despite this overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., described the tax cuts as a ""cynical one-two gut punch to the middle class"" that would ""raise their taxes."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  called them ""simply theft — monumental, brazen theft — from the American middle-class and from every person who aspires to reach it.""How could anyone describe the TCJA as a middle-class tax hike? By simply ignoring the first eight years of roughly $900-per-year tax relief and focusing only on the $20 tax hike — that's six cents per day — that the median-income family will theoretically face in 2027 if Congress fails to renew the expiring portions of the law.Of course, if your best argument is that the expiration of the tax cuts would harm families, then the obvious solution is to renew them. Instead, House Democrats are rallying around legislation to repeal all of the tax cuts — including those for the middle class.Furthermore, popular liberal proposals such as single-payer health care, a federal jobs guarantee, free college, and a carbon tax would certainly require steep middle-class tax increases in order to fund the programs.Simply put, the Republicans are cutting middle-class taxes while Democrats would force them upwards.The TCJA is certainly not above criticism. Yet Democrats continue to undercut their complaints by trying to double-down on the aspects they claim to oppose the most.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:States Get A Windfall From GOP Tax Cuts, But Will They Return The Money To Taxpayers?Thanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.Turns Out, The Rich Will Pay A Bigger Share Of Income Taxes Under GOP Tax Cuts

1251,A,"The IBD 50's gains over the past 24 months could make any professional fund manager or individual investor salivate.On a price-weighted basis, the index has climbed more than 74% since late June of 2016. And the S&P 500? The large-cap benchmark has risen about 32%, excluding cash dividends. Some companies featured in the IBD 50 have gone up a lot more.The market never guarantees that past performance will repeat. So as we head into the second half of the year, don't think too much about the quantity of profits you might reap. Instead, focus on the quality of price-and-volume action by the stocks that interest you.Before a stock even attempts a new breakout and surpasses the proper buy point, examine how well it's actually formed the base. Know the price at which you might have to bail.Gauge how volatile the stock trades in price, week to week. Does a stock candidate trade like Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which can go up or down 5% to 10% in any single week? If yes, then make sure you can stomach such big moves.The biotech group member formed a pair of bases after it hit a then-record peak of 50.05 in September. The first base — from September to January — showed poor quality. Most of it formed underneath the 10-week moving average. Another flaw? The relative strength line did not reach new high ground as Supernus rallied past a 43.35 buy point in its double-bottom base.Here's another chart-reading tip. Count the number of weeks within the base in which a stock ends the week up in heavy volume. Then count the down weeks in above-average turnover. If the former exceeds the latter, the more likely that institutions are showing net demand.There are exceptions.Before Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) cleared a 26.29 buy point in a nine-week cup base, the stock logged one up week in heavy volume and one down week in charged-up trade: No net accumulation. But the base showed lots of tight weekly price closes. Ditto for PGT Innovations (PGTI) in its latest flat-base structure.If a stock falls for the week in heavy turnover, but it closed in the upper half or upper 60% of the price range, don't count it as a bad sell-off week. Such action may actually be positive. Why? Funds stepped in during the sell-off to grab shares and support the stock price.Let's look at the two latest bases that Canada Goose (GOOS) formed. The apparel maker peaked at 24.32 in June 2017. It then crafted a 21-week cup with handle. That base showed five up weeks in big turnover, and just one down week in heavy trade. Volume was huge when Canada Goose fell 10% in the week ended June 30, 2017. But a secondary offering of shares caused the huge boost.Never chase a hot stock. One can never know when the top names in the IBD 50 or other growth stock screens suddenly begin a serious correction.Wall Street veterans say the market discounts the future. In 2018, it's weighed the risks of a potential military flare-up on the Korean Peninsula; the move by long-term interest rates past 3%; the strength in crude oil; the escalation in tariffs on imports among the U.S., China, Canada, Mexico and Europe; and a government investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.What else could pop up?Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at $117 billion asset manager Payden & Rygel, is keeping a sharp eye on one measure of inflation, the median increase in the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), as calculated by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. Cleveland says the 2.7% year-over-year increase in median CPI is the highest in the current economic growth cycle that began in June of 2009.""People say to us, 'Inflation is up, but it's only energy.' But we think it's more than oil,"" Cleveland told IBD in an interview. ""We think there's more room for inflation expectations to rise, and it could lead to higher Treasury bond yields."" Higher yields can make bonds more attractive vs. equities.RELATED:How To Beat The Major Indexes: Do You Employ This Portfolio Technique?Inside IBD Big Cap 20What Should A Good Cup With Handle Look Like?

1255,A,"Think of Red Hat (RHT) as a technology company that has reinvented itself not just once, but twice in 15 years.There aren't too many of those around — Netflix (NFLX) comes to mind. And the payoff can be huge for companies that manage to pull it off.While Netflix morphed from DVD renter to movie streamer to new-age Hollywood powerhouse, Red Hat's reinvention is tied to the rise of cloud computing. Like many traditional suppliers of information technology, it has been pressured to adapt.""Red Hat has gambled on a couple of significant cloud technologies or trends,"" said Dennis Smith, an analyst at Gartner Group. ""One of them has come up aces. That's container technology and container adoption. The other bet is on a multicloud strategy. The jury is still out on that.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe software maker's original claim to fame: It led the commercialization of Linux open-source software. Its Linux operating system runs servers in data centers operated by most large U.S. companies.Two years ago, bearish analysts said Red Hat faced a day of reckoning as Corporate America shifted more business workloads to cloud-computing specialists like Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).""Public"" cloud service providers rent customers shared computing infrastructure, including servers and data storage systems. Aside from AWS, the biggest cloud players are Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM).Bearish analysts warned that companies would buy less of Red Hat's software for their private data centers and that it could be shut out from the cloud. One worry was that Amazon Web Services offered customers its own version of open-source Linux for free.But Red Hat already pivoted from its core Linux business. The company aimed to build a cloud-friendly app development platform.It also charged into a new cloud technology called containers. By using Red Hat's software containers, corporate developers build custom apps in private data centers and move workloads to public clouds.Red Hat's OpenShift platform combines Linux, container technology, cloud automation tools and software-defined networking for data storage. The OpenShift cloud product is priced 10 times higher than Red Hat's enterprise Linux software.""Our software runs everywhere, (in) on-premise and multiple public clouds. That's part of the story,"" Chief Executive James Whitehurst told Investor's Business Daily in an interview.""The other piece of the story is that, oh, Red Hat isn't dead. It has a much larger addressable market opportunity because Linux is only so big but this next thing is potentially 10 times larger,"" Whitehurst added. ""That combination — Red Hat is not dead and its addressable market — is why you're seeing so much interest in Red Hat and the stock.""Cloud computing marks the latest evolution in Red Hat's business model. In the early 1990s, Red Hat developed its own version of Linux, open-source software. The company gave the software away for free, then sold shrink-wrapped boxed versions in hopes of making money from technical support.A decade later, the Raleigh, N.C.-based company released Red Hat Enterprise Linux for corporate customers. With additional features, RHEL targeted computer servers in on-premise data centers.RHEL enabled the software maker to shift to a subscription-based business model. The company provided customers with software updates via the web.Red Hat next moved into virtualization, or software that enables servers to share business workloads. In that market, it took on powerhouses VMware (VMW) and Microsoft.As the tech industry slowly bounced back from the 2008-09 global recession, Red Hat stock did OK. But it never caught on fire like that of Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. One investor concern was that Red Hat's Linux-related growth might be limited as new rivals leveraged open-source software.In 2017, Red Hat showed signs of gaining traction in cloud computing. Analysts focused on its early lead in container technology. Shares shot up 71% in 2017 and have gained 40% this year.Revenue rose 21% to $2.98 billion in the year ended Feb. 28. Adjusted profit increased 31% to $2.98 a share.At its analyst day in May, the company said its emerging technology segment now has an annual $200 million run rate. Most of that comes from cloud revenue, such as OpenShift.""While RHEL still stands at Red Hat's core, it is clear that OpenShift is its future,"" Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron said in a report to clients.Gartner's Smith says that large RHEL customers have given OpenShift a boost. He says it's unclear if OpenShift will keep its momentum with smaller RHEL users.Red Hat isn't alone in aiming to make it easier for companies to develop apps that can run on multiple public clouds. It competes with Pivotal Software (PVTL), spun off by VMware, Docker and Rancher Labs.Red Hat has an edge, Smith says, as companies steer away from proprietary technologies that could lock them into one vendor for years. The Linux leader's tools enable companies to develop applications that run on cloud infrastructure, a market called platform-as-a-service, or PaaS.""Red Hat provides the most flexible PaaS environment from an infrastructure standpoint, allowing users to runs its solution on private data centers or in any public cloud,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Adam Holt said in his note to clients. ""Pivotal has a similar offering to Red Hat, but not as broad or deep.""Red Hat partnered with AWS, by far the biggest cloud service provider, in 2017. They aimed to make it easier for OpenShift customers to move workloads to the AWS cloud platform.At its investor day in May, Red Hat and Microsoft announced they will jointly offer OpenShift as a managed service on the Azure cloud platform.""While not a needle-mover short term, the Microsoft partnership represents a sizable call option for future growth,"" Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst said in a report.Reports surfaced in March that Google's cloud-computing unit was eyeing an acquisition of the Linux leader to boost its presence in the corporate market.""I could see why any cloud provider might say owning Red Hat has value because it would give them more ability to move workloads to their cloud,"" Redhat's Whitehurst said. ""But any cloud provider would also have to recognize that we are neutral and weigh the benefits of having an edge moving workloads with the dis-synergy associated with us losing our Switzerland status.""The company also has been a steady acquirer of startups.In 2006, it bought JBoss for $350 million. With the purchase, Red Hat gained popular enterprise application development tools. In 2015, the company bought cloud automation specialist Ansible for a reported $150 million.In January, Red Hat acquired container platform developer CoreOS for $250 million, marking its largest deal since buying JBoss.""OpenShift will be more formidable once it integrates the recently acquired CoreOS,"" said a Cowen & Co. report on container technology. ""Although we estimate that OpenShift was only 3% of total Red Hat billings (a sales growth metric) in fiscal 2018, we forecast that it will eclipse $300 million in 2020 billings, equating to 7% of total.""The report went on to say: ""Given its financial resources, container focus, and strong recent track record with (mergers), we believe that Red Hat will perhaps uniquely, continue to act as a consolidator of some of the very best innovation in the container market.""Shares of Red Hat gained 1.1% on Friday to 171.06.RELATED LINKS:Sell And Take Profits Or Hold?

1264,A,"Accountability: Even before President Trump announced his pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, predictions of doom and gloom were rampant. They'll only get more dire as Brett Kavanaugh's nomination battle proceeds. Will anyone hold these people accountable for their unfounded, irresponsible, uninformed scaremongering claims?As a public service, we've been collecting some of the more fantastical forecasts about the hellscape that Judge Kavanaugh will unleash on the country should he make it to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, political leaders and the media can get away with such outlandish claims because nobody bothers to follow up. They just make a new round of dire predictions.We think that needs to change. So we encourage readers to print and save this for future reference. See if any of them come to pass with Kavanaugh on the bench. Hold the scaremongers accountable.""If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages and working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law & more."" — Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., who is another likely contender for the Democratic nomination.""If confirmed, American citizens will hemorrhage basic rights, and corporations will have an open door for a hostile takeover.""— Tom Steyer, billionaire Democratic financier.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court it will have a profoundly negative effect on workers' rights, women's rights and voting rights for decades to come.""— Sen. Bernie Sanders, Socialist-Vt.""A woman's right to choose is on the line, LGBTQ rights could be rolled back, affordable health care could be brought down, fair housing, consumer protections and environmental protections could all be decimated.""— JB Pritzker, Democratic candidate for Illinois governor.""With Brett Kavanaugh on the bench, Roe v. Wade, affordable health care, labor unions, and civil rights will all be on the chopping block.""— Democratic National Committee.""@realDonaldTrump is using this nomination as a destructive tool on a generation of progress for workers, women, LGBTQ people, communities of color & families, and to radically reverse the course of American justice and democracy.""— House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.""With a subservient Republican Congress and a far-right Supreme Court, there is a real risk that the worst impulses of the Trump presidency will go unchecked."" — Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.""Kavanaugh was the right pick if Trump's top priority was protecting himself from criminal investigation.""— Vox.com's Ezra Klein.""Even CONSIDERING this nomination will cement the first American dictatorship.""— Joss Whedon, movie director.""OK Ladies and Gentlemen who care for and respect ladies, it is official. The move back to Medieval Values, Shariah Law even, where old, bitter men get to tell women what is best for their bodies, lives, and well being is as done a deal as this is Twitter. Unless we say NO! NO!"" — Ron Perlman, movie actor who played ""Hellboy.""""Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.""— Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.""Judge Brett Kavanaugh's extreme outlier approach to the Second Amendment would put in jeopardy the full range of gun safety laws.""— Moms Demand Action, gun control advocacy group.""Judge Kavanaugh's dangerous views on the Second Amendment are far outside the mainstream of even conservative thought and stand in direct opposition to the values and priorities of the vast majority of Americans.""— Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona.""With a Justice Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, we could see reversals of hard-won gains securing equal opportunity in education, employment and housing. We could see further exclusion of communities of color from participation in our democracy. We could see racism continue to flourish within the criminal justice system. We could see the elimination of effective tools for proving discrimination.""— NAACP statement.""Kavanaugh will only further threaten to erode our nation's promise of freedom, justice and equality for all.""— Muslim Civil Rights Group ""In selecting Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, @realDonaldTrump has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block.""— Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.""The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come and will morph our Supreme Court into a political arm of the right-wing Republican Party.""— Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.""If Brett Kavanaugh survives the confirmation process, he will rapidly advance a fringe right agenda on the court that will accelerate plutocratic control of our economy and politics, actively undermine the steps our country must take towards greater racial equity, and directly lead to the deaths of countless women with the dismantling of abortion rights.""— Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America. ""Trump's announcement today is a death sentence for thousands of women in the United States.""— Statement by The Women's March, which referred in the headline to ""Donald Trump's nomination of XX to the Supreme Court.""""Tonight 's announcement threatens to destroy decades of progress made by our nation's most vulnerable communities, and it locks in a white supremacist agenda from Capitol to the White House to the halls of our nation's highest courts.""— Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director, Action Center on Race and Economy.""When President Trump Monday nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, he probably doomed the right to abortion, same-sex marriage and maybe even contraception.""— Jay Michaelson, legal affairs columnist at the Daily Beast.The winners for most hysterical forecasts, however, are Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for the taxpayer-funded National Public Radio, and presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.Before Trump named Kavanaugh, here's what Harris had to say on MSNBC:""If Trump gets what he wants here what's the court gonna look like the next 30 years? We're looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United States.""And here's how Totenberg described the impact of Trump's replacing Justice Kennedy on NPR's ""All Things Considered"": ""Roe v. Wade might be reversed. Lots of federal regulations might be thrown out, might be a different, more — less tolerant view of gun regulation and affirmative action. He was the fifth vote to uphold affirmative action in higher education. That could change, too — so as R.E.M. once put it, 'the end of the world as we know it.' ""You can bet that none of these horror stories will come true if Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court.Unfortunately, it's also a certainty that none of these politicians, opinion makers or celebrities will be held to account for their flagrant efforts to mislead the country and stir up anger and hostility.(If readers find other examples of horrific predictions, feel free to tweet them to us @IBDEditorials and we'll try to add them to the list.)Will Left's Rank Politics Of Rage Keep Kavanaugh Off The Supreme Court?Dispatches From The 'Tolerant' Left's War On Trump SupportersSan Francisco: Poster-Child For The Failure Of U.S. Cities' Blue Model

1301,A,"Wall Street showed choppy action in stocks today, but in late-afternoon trading the Nasdaq composite took out its morning highs and rebounded further, up nearly 0.8% at around 2:30 p.m. ET. The leading index is also trying to stay on the north side of its critical 50-day moving average after a 1.5% sell-off the prior session.The small-cap S&P 600 lagged, but is now up 0.2%.A final revision of U.S. GDP growth to 2% in the first quarter did not inspire energetic buying by fund managers. The increase missed the Econoday consensus forecast of up 2.2%. But a few megacap techs, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), showed positive support at the key 50-day moving average.Apple, at 185.08, is hovering above its own 50-day moving average and keeping thin gains after a May 4 breakout past a 179.04 entry in a double bottom.

1306,A,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too. After a breakout from a cup-with-handle in late April, shares ended last week 14% above the 271.89 buy point.

1308,A,"The words ""Made in China"" now hang in the balance on whether the Trump administration will declare a trade war on imported steel and aluminum, and use tariffs as a sledgehammer for negotiating a better, long-term trade deal.The president has doubled down on his commitment to enforce tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, actions that offer a Pyrrhic victory for America's 140,000 steel workers but at great cost to steel consuming manufacturers in America who employ 6.5 million workers.As the U.S. remains on the precipice of a trade war with China, we should examine whether it is wise to barter for the economic vitality of one layer of American industry — a struggling steel industry — while imposing increased costs on many other sectors of our economy, including agriculture, automakers, various manufacturing companies and energy producers.The United States has frequently tried to go the protectionist route of tariffs, and often with terrible results. Whether it was the more recent Bush administration steel tariffs in the early 2000s or the Smoot-Hawley tariff act going all the way back to the 1930s, it's clear that strategic trade, not free trade, has a populist political allure.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's a line of economic debate and thinking that matches the theme of President Trump's ""America First"" drumbeat.This is what drove the Trump Administration to initiate, in 2017, a Section 232 National Security investigation into whether imports of steel and aluminum were adversely affecting U.S. national security. The investigation focused on China's decades-long program of subsidizing its steel and aluminum industries, which has resulted in global oversupply of steel and the consequent suppression of global prices.The Commerce Department's section 232 findings indicated that imported steel and aluminum ""threaten to impair the national security."" The president accepted these conclusions and moved to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports, ensuring that the U.S. industries would be able to sustain sufficient capacity utilization rates to remain competitive. Or so Trump's economic advisors seem to think.No one has a crystal ball to predict the future, but by referencing the aforementioned Bush steel tariffs, we can see the likely ill effects. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel products following a period in which 30 American steel manufacturers declared bankruptcy.According to a Trade Partnership Worldwide analysis, these steel import tariffs resulted in 200,000 Americans losing their jobs across a variety of industries. Workers lost approximately $4 billion in wages and American steel consumers bore a heavy cost. The tariffs were so disastrous that Bush lifted them just a year after they were implemented.On a more micro-scale, steel tariffs have severe implications for a variety of industries, for example the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas production is steel-intensive, with steel products needed for drilling, pipeline, onshore and offshore production facilities, refineries, LNG terminals, refineries, and petrochemical plants.Tariffs on steel pipe and other products will increase the cost of production, particularly with respect to deep water projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and quotas will cause delays because U.S. substitutes are not immediately available or have not been qualified.Pipeline-grade steel is a specialty product. It must meet high quality specifications not required for other steel products (pipeline steel can't be brittle or it could crack and cause a pipeline incident). American steel manufacturers have largely exited the niche pipeline market because it is relatively small and involves higher costs and lower margins.Today, U.S. steel producers are capable of meeting just 3% of the total steel required by the energy pipeline industry.There is little doubt that the steel import tariffs will have an effect on the competitiveness of the U.S. oil and gas industry, among others. In fact, these tariffs run counter to the Administration's policy of U.S. energy dominance.Steel tariffs could open Pandora's box. In attempting to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, we shouldn't risk being drawn into a trade war. The Trump administration must examine the effects of trade policies across the full industrial spectrum. Steel tariffs represent a dangerous blunt foreign policy instrument that could easily do more harm than good, threatening both America's energy and economic resurgence.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1314,A,"Vanguard Group is ratcheting up the money-management price war as investors increasingly focus on costs. The fund group said last week it will begin offering almost 1,800 exchange traded funds commission-free to online customers on its brokerage platform.Vanguard, which currently sells only 77 of its own ETFs without commissions, will extend the program to products sold by rivals such as BlackRock (BLK), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and State Street (STT), the Valley Forge, Pa.-based firm said in a statement July 2. The no-fee offer won't include inverse and leveraged ETFs, which Vanguard considers speculative investments.""This is about giving investors access to more low-cost options,"" Karin Risi, managing director of Vanguard's retail investor group, said in a phone interview. She said Vanguard has been spending money on its brokerage platform over the past few years to improve the customer experience.Vanguard, a pioneer of low-cost index investing since the 1970s, has been matched and occasionally beaten in recent years on the price of ETFs or other passive funds by BlackRock, Schwab and Fidelity Investments as competition heats up in one of the industry's fastest-growing segments. Schwab, Fidelity and discount brokers such as E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) sell a broad range of ETFs commission-free, their websites show.""This is really about getting a share of investors's wallets,"" said Jeff DeMaso, co-editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter. ""If someone stays on your platform he might be more likely to buy another Vanguard fund in the future.""Vanguard, with more than $900 billion in ETF assets, is the second-biggest competitor in the U.S. ETF business, trailing only BlackRock.Eight of this year's top 10 ETFs by flows are offered by BlackRock's iShares. For the fifth straight year, BlackRock and Vanguard are miles ahead of every other ETF issuer, accounting for almost two-thirds of flows. BlackRock has shown a willingness to slash fees even on highly successful products to fend off the Vanguard juggernaut.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:These Top Tech Stock Plays Beat The Market Despite Recent SlideThis Sector Races Ahead As Top Stock Biogen SoarsLatest ETF News And Analysis

1315,A,"Tesla stock sank below an important indicator Tuesday as analysts continued to digest its report on Model 3 production that hit key goals of Chief Executive Elon Musk but fell short in other areas.XThe electric-car maker on Sunday said it produced 5,031 Tesla Model 3 vehicles in the last week of the second quarter, inching past its goal of 5,000 vehicles for the first time. That production level is critical for the company to reach profitability.Following the report, Tesla stock initially jumped 6% early Monday, then ended the regular trading session down 2.3% after analysts looked deeper into the Tesla statement.Tesla stock closed down 7.2% to 310.86 on the stock market today. Shares fell below its 200-day moving average, a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining the overall long-term trend. Tesla stock also fell to its 50-day moving average. A breach of the 50-day line can be a sell signal.In order for Tesla to reach production goals Musk allegedly asked engineers to halt putting Model 3 vehicles through a standard brake and roll alignment test on June 26, according to a report from Business Insider. In a statement, Tesla responded that ""we drive every Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle.""Among those not impressed with the report on Model 3 production was Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino. He maintained a sell rating on Tesla stock and price target of 195. That's 61% below where Tesla stock currently trades. Among his concerns were that although Tesla reached its production goal, the company did not ship as many Model 3s as expected.The company said it delivered 18,440 Model 3s in the second quarter. That's about 10,000 units short of analyst estimates.Analysts were also concerned that the high level of enthusiasm for Tesla vehicles may be waning. Tamberrino thinks that might be the reason Tesla shares fell Monday.Tesla said it had about 420,000 net Model 3 reservations at the end of the second quarter. That's down from 455,000 reservations during the company's July 2017 Model 3 unveiling.""This indicates that net reservations have decreased by approximately 16,600 (taking into consideration delivery figures) from the end of the first quarter,"" Tamberrino wrote in a research note to clients. He said this comes after the company had noted that reservations were stable the previous two quarters.On the flip side is Tesla bull Romit Shah at Nomura, who has perhaps the highest stock-price target on record. Following the Tesla report, Shah maintained a buy rating on Tesla and price target of 450.Tesla hitting production targets ""is an important milestone that we believe reestablishes some credibility and positions the company for profitability in the second half of the year,"" Shah wrote in a research note to clients. ""That said, we continue to expect Tesla stock to be volatile near term.""Also of concern to analysts is the company spending cash at a hefty clip, which recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. Tesla's cash burn and debt load are among the reasons it's one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street.RELATED:Can Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?Tesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetAnnual Meeting Reveals China Battery Plant, Teases Model Y PlansGet these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1316,A,"Dow futures rose solidly Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. But the stock market is under pressure on Trump trade war concerns. U.S.-China fireworks begin Friday. A pair of sectors at high risk from a Trump trade war have been big losers. That includes Dow Jones industrials such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), as well as automakers. Chipmakers slumping, with Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) stocks all failed breakouts. Apple (AAPL) stock also coming under pressure, with its heavy exposure to China.Dow futures rose 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.6% higher.The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET. At that meeting, policymakers raised rates and signaled two more Fed rate hikes are likely this year, one more than previously expected. Investors will be looking to see how hawkish Fed members really are.Also Thursday: the ADP employment report will estimate June private-sector hiring, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and ISM will issue its June nonmanufacturing index. Those all lead up to Labor's June employment report on Friday.But the big news Friday: President Trump is due to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, mostly tech and telecom products. China says it will immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar.In Tuesday's half-day session before the 4th of July holiday, the major stock market averages opened higher but reversed lower. Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, but closed above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index slid 0.5%, once again sinking below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.55% after rising intraday above its 200-day line.Micron stock triggered Tuesday's sell-off. A Chinese court barred Micron Technology from selling chips in the country, siding with Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics (UMC) in a patent fight. Rightly or wrong, investors took that Micron ruling as part of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been holding up approval of the Qualcomm (QCOM)-NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) deal until the U.S. lifts harsh sanctions on China telecom gear giant ZTE.In any case, Micron stock fell 5.5% Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.8%, moving back below its 200-day line. Micron was indicated lower again Thursday.Chip stocks have been conspicuous laggards even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit new highs in June. Even Intel stock, Nvidia stock and Micron stock, which were outperforming the chip sector, have fallen well below buy points and their 50-day moving averages.U.S.-China trade war tariffs won't target semiconductors much at first. But the U.S. is wary of China of buying cutting-edge tech as Beijing seeks dominance via Made in China 2025. Beijing could continue to make life difficult for U.S. chipmakers working in China via regulatory hurdles. Longer term, the trend is toward a U.S.-China cold trade war in technology that would roil complex supply chains and cut off markets.China is a huge and growing market for Boeing jets. China could favor Airbus (EADSY) over Boeing in a trade war. Boeing was the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Boeing stock recently triggered a sell signal and is trading below its buy point.Another Dow Jones component, Caterpillar stock, has fallen below its 50-day and 200-day lines.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported solid U.S. sales Tuesday. But GM stock, Ford stock and their global peers are struggling as Trump threatens a global auto import tariff. That would trigger retaliation and raise supply chain costs as even U.S.-made cars and trucks tend to have high non-U.S. content.Apple, another Dow Jones stock, is also vulnerable to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. China is a big market for the Apple iPhone and various services. Most Apple iPhones are made in China. A trade war could hit iPhone suppliers, China could hold up exports and threaten any number of actions to hinder Apple.Apple stock blasted out of a buy zone in a sharp rally from the end of April to early May. Strong earnings helped, fueled by fast-growing high-margin services as iPhone sales were so-so A huge buyback and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) buying more Apple stock also were big Apple stock drivers.But in recent weeks, Apple stock has been fading. It's now just modestly above a buy point. Shares are fighting for support at 50-day, closing just below that level Tuesday.So far stocks have largely retreated on trade war fears, even as hopes remain that the actual damage will be minimal. But on Friday, President Trump is open hostilities with tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese goods. China has vowed to retaliate. Tariffs are slated to hit a further $16 billion in Chinese products soon.Trump has threatened tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, and then a further $200 billion.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In Common  IBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

1317,A,"With interest rates on the rise, exchange-traded-fund investors are increasingly embracing risk, pulling cash out of defensive utilities and piling into more volatile financials.Traders yanked almost $330 million from the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) on Monday after three straight weeks of inflows. Meanwhile, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, known as XLF, saw $368 million of inflows after four straight weeks of outflows.The moves were reflected in the broader market Monday, where financials were the best-performing industry group in the S&P 500 index with a 2.3% rally, and utilities were the worst, sinking 3.1%. Indeed, XLF had gained for three straight days before losing ground Tuesday, when financials were the only sector in the benchmark to post a loss.""The most important point about financials is they are very cheap now,"" said JP Gravitt, chief executive officer and market strategist for Market Realist.Banks are getting a boost ahead of earnings, as concerns over the recently completed Federal Reserve stress tests fade out of investors' view, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst Richard Ramsden on Monday. A flattening yield curve, however, could make the financials ETF less attractive, since 53% of its exposure is in banks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Michael Wilson, called for an ""aggressive rotation toward defensive sectors.""

1319,A,"The U.S. has begun an investigation into imports of automobiles and auto parts to determine whether those imports ""threaten to impair"" national security and the U.S. economy, the Commerce Department said late Wednesday, sending shares of automakers like Tata Motors (TTM), Toyota (TMC) and Honda (HMC) into retreat.XThe decision followed a ""conversation"" with President Trump, the Commerce Department said. And it could result in tariffs on automobiles brought in from abroad. The decision also represents the Trump administration's latest attempt to get tougher on international trade, which Trump has argued comes at the expense of U.S. workers' jobs.""There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement.""The Department of Commerce will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent investigation into whether such imports are weakening our internal economy and may impair the national security,"" it continued.Trump, in the past, has also criticized U.S. automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) for producing cars in Mexico.The move comes just a few days after China said it will cut import tariffs on certain vehicles to 15% from 25% effective July 1.""China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,"" a Ministry of Commerce spokesman told reporters in Beijing on Thursday.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to determine how, or whether, to hit back against overall imports from China. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two nations had put a trade war ""on hold,"" following negotiations. China said it would cut tariffs on some automobile imports.While foreign auto companies produce cars in the U.S., they also import some models. Volkswagen (VLKAY) dropped 1.8% to 39.17 in the stock market today, testing its 200-day line. Toyota slid 1.8% to 132.44, threatening to undo a cup base with a 138.78 buy point. Honda tumbled 1.9%, slicing below the low end of a flat base.Nissan (NSANY), also in a flat base, edged 0.5% lower. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 0.9%, as it works on a handle of a cup base with a 24.51 entry. India-based Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar and Land Rover, sank 5.85%.The Commerce Department launched the investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The statement said Ross had sent a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis to notify him of the investigation.""During the past 20 years, imports of passenger vehicles have grown from 32% of cars sold in the United States to 48%,"" the Department asserted in the statement. ""From 1990 to 2017, employment in motor vehicle production declined by 22%, even though Americans are continuing to purchase automobiles at record levels.""Ford was up 1.6% on Thursday, near its 200-day line.

1320,A,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and shot down the capital plan of a Deutsche Bank (DB) U.S. subsidiary in its second round of stress tests. But the central bank largely cleared the big banks to deliver payouts to shareholders. Bank stocks largely rose for much of the day, but closed mixed as the major market indexes slashed gains.The Fed, in ""conditionally"" passing Morgan and Goldman in the tests, said the banks would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years, which will allow them to build capital over the next year.""The central bank said those banks' capital ratios, under the plans they originally submitted and with a one-time reduction resulting from tax reform, fell below the Fed's required levels in the test.The second round of the tests — the one Wall Street cares more about — evaluates banks' dividend and buyback plans, and the strength of their risk management practices and other internal controls. Many of the banks that passed the second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, dialed up their shareholder returns.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement.All the banks tested passed the first round of the tests last week, although Morgan and Goldman came close to falling short on a key leverage ratio. Still, passing the annual industry health checkup, implemented after the financial crisis a decade ago, has become easier for the big banks, even as the Fed each year tries to add harsher, or at least different, ingredients to the mix.But even amid a surging economy and loosening regulations, bank stocks have wilted over the last few months on concerns over the economy longer-term.After the Fed expressed reservations, Morgan Stanley said it would boost its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share, up from 25 cents, and buy back up to $4.7 billion in common stock. Morgan Stanley stock rose Friday but remained near six-month lows.Goldman said that its capital plan included a boost in its dividend to 85 cents per share, up from 80 cents. The bank also said its capital plan allowed up to $5 billion in stock buybacks. Goldman rose modestly and was near nine-month lows.Goldman said the Fed did not object to its capital plan, ""conditioned upon the firm returning not more than $6.3 billion of capital beginning in the third quarter of 2018 and ending in the second quarter of 2019.""The Fed said it objected to the capital plan from the Deutsche Bank subsidiary, DB USA Corp., citing ""material weaknesses in the firm's data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress.""The Fed also gave State Street Corp. (STT) a conditional pass. The central bank said its evaluation revealed ""counterparty exposures that produced large losses.""""The firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress,"" the Fed added.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it intends to raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 80 cents a share, up from 56 cents a share, effective in Q3. The bank also OK'd share buybacks of up to $20.7 billion between July 1 and June 30, 2019.Citigroup (C), meanwhile, announced an increase in its dividend to 45 cents a share, up from 32 cents. It also announced a buyback program of up to $17.6 billion during the four quarters starting in the third quarter.Bank of America (BAC) said its board plans to raise its dividend by 25% to 15 cents a share, starting in Q3. BofA said it had also been cleared to buy back roughly $20.6 billion in common stock.JPMorgan Chase bumped retreated 0.7% in the stock market today, reversing from solid gains intraday. Bank of America retreated 1.6%. Citigroup picked up 0.1%. Goldman Sachs lost 1.3% while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.8%.In the first round of bank stress tests, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley nearly missed clearing the minimum for what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio. The ratio measures how much capital a bank needs in relation to its assets.Morgan Stanley, in a statement last week, said those results ""may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make"" after the release of the second round of results. Goldman said essentially the same thing, with a statement that it expected to discuss the first-round test results with the Fed.Banks can resubmit their payout plans if the Fed's results are too pessimistic for a bank's liking.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement last Thursday.Under the bleakest economic scenario, the Fed last week concluded that the 35 banks subject to the tests would lose $578 billion total. The so-called ""severely adverse"" scenario, the harshest one laid out by the Fed each year, included a global recession and a six percentage-point rise in unemployment to 10%.The source of bank stocks' woes has been the tightening Treasury yield curve. The curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, has narrowed sharply over the past several months to the flattest in years. The spread has narrowed further in the last few weeks.Rates on longer end of the curve tend to rise when expectations for the economy are brighter. The idea is that when the economy grows, prices rise, so investors demand a higher return on government debt to make up for the declining purchasing power of the dollar over that time. Borrowers are willing to pay up, because they expect a higher rate of return.But longer-term rates have waned. Meanwhile, the short end of the curve has risen, thanks to the Fed's recent hikes on overnight rates. That sluggish long-term yield reflects concerns that the Fed will raise rates too aggressively as the Trump tax cuts and fiscal stimulus boost economic growth in 2018 but then wear offBanks tend to borrow money according to short-term rates, while lending out money according to longer-term rates. The narrowing gap between short-term and long-term bond yields thus threatens to crimp banks' profits.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blame The Fed For Dow, S&P Struggles, Not Just Trump Trade WarsThe Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBanking Industry's Zelle Seen Outgrowing Square Cash, PayPal's VenmoBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

1321,A,"The China trade war may be about to get better, not worse. Despite Wednesday's sell-off as the Trump administration identified $200 billion worth of potential targets for future Trump tariffs, the key moment is about to arrive that could see the ice break in the brewing technological cold war between the U.S. and China.Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE saw shares soar on Thursday as the U.S. agreed to let the company resume doing business with American suppliers, pending the receipt of a $400 million escrow payment.Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that both the U.S. and China are prepared to resume stalled trade negotiations.The confluence of events is likely no coincidence. President Trump's commitment to lift sanctions that amounted to a death sentence for ZTE seemed to break a logjam in U.S.-China trade negotiations back in May. Soon after, Trump touted a prospective trade deal with Beijing, tweeting that  ""China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products"" and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the China trade war had been put ""on hold"" amid progress in negotiations.Those negotiations stalled as Congress complicated Trump's pledge via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" The Senate preserved the ban on doing business with ZTE in the national defense authorization bill, but those harsh terms may not be included in the final version expected to pass in late July.The stock market reaction on Wednesday came as the threat of escalating Trump tariffs became more tangible, though the likelihood of tariffs hadn't changed. In June, President Trump directed the Office of the Trade Representative to come up with a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that could face 10% tariffs, and trade officials produced that list late Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, the market downdraft on Wednesday was fairly modest. Wall Street still seems to be betting that this round of Trump tariffs will never take flight and that China won't escalate its retaliation against U.S. multinationals. We'll probably know whether Wall Street is right within the next several weeks, as the White House prepares to impose the new tariffs by Aug. 30.As long as Congress hews to Trump's wishes and drops the Senate provision mandating a ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese communications equipment firm, U.S.-China trade negotiations could quickly resume and begin to demonstrate progress.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress, so there is still a risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But a U.S. reprieve for ZTE and its 75,000 global employees may allow Xi to resume negotiations without losing face, despite the Trump tariffs already in place.Yet if ZTE gets a new lease on life and there isn't a nearly immediate thaw in the China trade war and threats of more Trump tariffs continue to fly, look out.This may be the last off-ramp before a full-scale trade war that threatens to seriously damage business prospects for U.S. multinationals in China and severely disrupt technology supply chains.The U.S. imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, meaning about half of Chinese imports would be affected by Trump's latest tariff threat.As Trump threatens a full-scale China trade war, Beijing vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow.While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) via regulations.China's government also could hit Boeing sales, and likely Caterpillar, through its state-owned enterprises that can sway the market. Meanwhile, Beijing has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The way things are going, there's little reason to expect China to blink in the face of Trump threats. BMW said this week that it will shift some SUV production from South Carolina to China in the face of Trump tariffs. Meanwhile, China's currency is losing ground vs. the dollar, counteracting the impact of Trump's threatened 10% tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Falls As Trump Threatens New Tariffs; Netflix Holds UpChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

1324,A,"Wall Street showed choppy action in stocks today, but in late-afternoon trading the Nasdaq composite took out its morning highs and rebounded further, up nearly 0.8% at around 2:30 p.m. ET. The leading index is also trying to stay on the north side of its critical 50-day moving average after a 1.5% sell-off the prior session.The small-cap S&P 600 lagged, but is now up 0.2%.A final revision of U.S. GDP growth to 2% in the first quarter did not inspire energetic buying by fund managers. The increase missed the Econoday consensus forecast of up 2.2%.

1329,A,"It's a mystery. The U.S. economy seems strong. Since the nadir of the Great Recession, employers have added about 19 million workers. The unemployment rate is 4%, near the lowest level since 2000. By standard economic theory, the strong demand for labor should be pushing up wages. But that isn't happening. Wage gains of 2.7% roughly match inflation.And no one really knows why.The puzzle is not just American. It also applies to much of Europe and Japan. ""Wage growth is still missing in action,"" declares a new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Worse, the ""unprecedented wage stagnation is not evenly distributed across workers."" While wages of the top 1% are growing, they're stagnating for most others. Inequality and resentment worsen.Nor does the media agree on what's happening. Many publications have run stories exploring the wage puzzle. But others, notably The Wall Street Journal, have reported that labor markets are stronger than they seem. ""Workers Welcome Wage Gains, But Companies Feel Squeeze,"" said one recent Journal headline. ""Hiring Boom Draws Workers Back,"" said another.According to government figures, there are now 6.7 million job openings — a record high — and ""the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is higher than it was before the onset of the Great Recession,"" writes economist Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute in a column for Bloomberg. Still, as yet, wages haven't exploded. One intriguing theory asserts that psychology and norms have changed, writes Strain.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""People who entered the labor market during and after the Great Recession have lived through some rough times and don't have strong memories of better times,"" he writes. ""I'm sure that many workers — both relatively new entrants and those with long experience — have had moments when they felt lucky to have a job at all. Even though the economy has been strengthening for years, are workers reluctant to go into the boss's office and ask for a raise? Likewise, are employers used to resisting increases in their payroll obligations.""Maybe.Strain admits that this is just a guess, and finding corroborating evidence is hard. He also usefully lists other theories. With thanks and apologies to him, here's a summary of his summary.(1) There's more ""slack"" in labor markets than standard employment statistics indicate. People who had given up looking for work are re-entering the job market. More than 5 million people say they'd like a job but aren't counted in the labor market because they're not looking.(2) Demographics — the aging of American society — distort reported wage changes. As well-paid baby-boom workers retire, they're being replaced by younger and not-so-well paid workers, even though their wages may be rising. But the effect is diluted by the loss of retirees' high wages.(3) Employers are competing for workers ""using levers other than wages"" — better fringe benefits, signing bonuses, laxer overall standards in hiring. Although these have economic value, they don't boost wages.(4) Some employers refrained from cutting wages during the worst of the recession and are now trying to offset these higher costs by delaying new wage increases.(5) There is no problem — only a misinterpretation of economic data. Strain cites a study by Adam Ozimek of Moody's Analytics that examined the ""employment rate"" (the share of a population with a job), as opposed to the unemployment rate, and found that wages are ""growing at a pace you would expect."" Similarly, slow productivity growth implies slow wage growth.Strain declares himself impressed but not convinced.

1333,A,"The final day of the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) got underway in Chicago with a panel discussion of the pros and cons of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and blockchain, the computer-based record keeping system that underlies digital currencies.XThe four panelists ranged from advocates like Jim Sinegal, Morningstar equity analyst for banking and payments, and Adley Bowden, vice president of market analysis at PitchBook, to cryptocurrency skeptic Philip Straehl, head of capital markets and asset allocation for Morningstar's Investment Management group.Straehl said he bases investment worthiness on an asset's valuation as determined by the worth of its future cash flow — and cryptocurrencies have zero cash flow. The only thing that can raise their prices is willingness of other investors to pay more than you did, he said.Depending on what he called ""the greater fool"" to raise an asset's value makes the asset speculative, he said, and it's not something he would recommend to a client.In a press briefing before the panel session, Sinegal said cryptocurrencies may be volatile, but so are works of art by recognized artists. ""I tried to sell (Straehl) my Monet, but he said no — it has no cash flow,"" Sinegal joked.In the panel discussion, Straehl said that blockchain will likely spawn companies that benefit from that technology's development. But it is too early to identify companies whose stocks will benefit in that way.Likewise, it is also too soon to know which stocks will lose business from the growth he expects to see in blockchain. Investors should short those losers once they are identifiable, he said. Winners and losers may come from banks, securities exchanges, credit reporting companies and marketplaces, Sinegal said.In a later Wednesday morning session, David Herro, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of international equity at Harris Associates; and Diana Strandberg, director of international equity at Dodge & Cox, participated in a discussion of global equities.Herro said that as a general rule it is important for an investor to distinguish between good companies and good investments. Valuation is the key to doing that, he said.It is more difficult to determine valuation in some markets than others, the two noted investors agreed. ""We're not huge fans of certain countries, like Russia,"" Herro said.Still, investors can find good stocks in markets they are otherwise wary of, Strandberg said. Brazil's Itau Unibanco Holding (ITUB) is one such stock she likes. It was a top-five holding of $61.2 billion Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund (DODFX) as of March 31.Itau's dividend yield is 2.14%. Its consensus forward price-earnings ratio is 10.17, Morningstar says.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Morningstar Investment Conference 2018: How Investors Can Profit From Human Nature

1334,A,"Supply-Side Economics: Democrats scoffed at Republicans who said the Trump tax cuts would at least partially pay for themselves through higher economic growth. But it looks like the GOP had it right all along, as revenues climb.The latest monthly budget report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that revenues from federal income taxes were $76 billion higher in the first half of this year, compared with the first half of 2017. That's a 9% jump, even though the lower income tax withholding schedules went into effect in February.The CBO says the gain ""largely reflects increases in wages and salaries.""For the fiscal year as a whole — which started last October — all federal revenues are up by $31 billion. That's a 1.2% in increase over last year, the CBO says.The Treasury Department, which issues a separate monthly report, says it expects federal revenues will continue to exceed last year's for the rest of the 2018 fiscal year.But wait a minute. According to Democrats, the Trump tax cuts were supposed to blow a massive hole in the deficit.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast November, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi promised that ""this thing will explode the deficit.""She also said that ""after the Republicans' tax plan blows a multi-trillion-dollar hole in the deficit, they will sharpen their knives for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and vital job-creating investments for middle class families.""Even now, Pelosi is sticking to her guns. In June, she called it ""the deficit-exploding GOP tax scam for the rich.""All along, Republicans countered that the tax cuts would spur additional economic growth, which would generate additional revenues, which would offset at least some of the cost of the tax cuts.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's response to that? ""It's just made-up, fake math to hide another deficit-busting tax cut to benefit the wealthiest Republicans.""Look at what's happened since the tax cuts went into effect.Economists hiked their projections for growth this year once the tax cuts passed. The CBO changed its 2018 forecast from 2% before the tax cuts passed to 3.3% after they took effect. In that same report, the CBO admitted that this added growth would offset a significant chunk of the tax cuts.Other Democratic big lies about the tax cuts continue to fall.In fact, corporations are bringing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits back as a direct result of changes in the corporate tax laws — 12% of the nearly $3 trillion held overseas came back to the U.S. in just the first three months of 2018. That will mean more economic growth and additional corporate revenues.As we have said many times in this space, the problem the country faces isn't that taxes are too low, but that spending is too high. The CBO projects that even with the Trump tax cuts in place, taxes as a share of GDP will steadily rise over the next decade, and will be higher than the post-World War II average.But bringing in more tax revenues doesn't help if spending goes up even faster. And that has, unfortunately, been the case, as the GOP-controlled Congress has gone on a spending spree.Look at it this way. Tax revenues are up by $31 billion so far this fiscal year compared with last year. But spending is up $115 billion.In other words, the entire increase in the deficit so far this year has been due to spending hikes, not tax cuts.Thanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.Supreme Court Opens The Door To Internet Taxes — What Comes Next Could Be A Lot WorseBad News For Dems: Household Income Hits All-Time High Under Trump … And He's Getting Credit For It

The new price target is based on conservative expectations for sales of spinal muscular drug Spinraza, he said in a report to clients.""We acknowledge our call could be early especially as multiple sclerosis/Spinraza dynamics play out in the coming quarters,"" he said. ""That said, we like the potential for the stock to benefit from a fear-of-missing-out rally as more data points crop up on Biogen's high-stakes Alzheimer's disease pipeline.""On the stock market today, Biogen slipped 0.2% to close at 293.96. Biogen stock is consolidating with a buy point at 370.67. Shares of other biotech companies collectively lifted 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBiogen is working on a number of Alzheimer's disease treatments, including aducanumab and a drug partnered with Eisai called BAN2401. Aducanumab data isn't expected until 2019 or 2020. Meanwhile, investors aren't hopeful for data from an 18-month study of BAN2401 in the third quarter.The 18-month study of BAN2401 could have some impact on expectations for aducanumab, he said. So far, aducanumab has shown some promise. Kulkarni sees a 35% chance aducanumab will get approval to treat Alzheimer's disease. He noted stocks tend to be volatile on Alzheimer's news.Aducanumab has been largely devoid of scares thus far, Kulkarni said. In February, Biogen increased the size of a study of aducanumab by 510 patients. That sent Biogen shares diving 6.6%. About the same time, Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) scrapped its studies of an Alzheimer's disease treatment.Still, ""the Alzheimer's disease market is large enough for Biogen to benefit from a fear of missing out in case positives emerge,"" he said.Kulkarni sees multiple sclerosis drug sales accounting for about 67% of Biogen's total revenue in 2018. Risks in that segment include rivalry from Roche's (RHHBY) drug Ocrevus — though Biogen gets a royalty on those sales — and drug-pricing concerns.""While that risk (of headwinds) still remains, we note that Biogen's prescription share, at least in the U.S., appears to have been stabilizing,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor trends closely, and are also mindful that it may be too early to ascertain the effects of initiatives such as value-based pricing.""Multiple sclerosis is often cited as an ""expensive"" condition to treat. In general, though, the frequency of price increases for these drugs has slowed from twice per year to once annually. Further, generics from the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) could eventually take share.For now, however, Biogen looks safe. Multiple sclerosis patients tend to stick with branded medicines and don't seem to see their doctors as often, Kulkarni said.Sales of spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza could be choppy on its loading dose schedule. Patients receive four loading doses in quick succession before moving to maintenance doses every four months. This means sales-per-patient peter off when they move to maintenance doses.""It is our view that investors were generally caught by surprise by the fast launch, and are now somewhat more pessimistic on the product given the most recent quarterly performance,"" he said.Further, Novartis (NVS) could compete now that it has acquired spinal muscular atrophy player AveXis.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Cut Your Losses Short

1345,A,"Energy Markets: Based on all the stories about ""surging"" gasoline prices, you might think the country was about to relive the energy crisis of the late 1970s. The truth is, the cost of filling up today is nowhere near where it was during most of the past decade.Just before the July Fourth holiday, several news outlets noted that pump prices are higher than they've been in four years. Democrats are, not surprisingly, playing this up as an election issue, saying it's the result of President Trump's misguided policies toward Iran and his softening Obama-era fuel economy standards for new cars.Trump, too, has joined the chorus of complaints, casting blame on OPEC.On July 4, Trump tweeted that OPEC ""is driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s. This must be a two-way street.""Fair enough. But the complaints about today's gasoline prices expose more about the short attention spans of Americans and the mainstream press than they do about oil markets.According to the Energy Information Administration's weekly report, a gallon of gas costs about $2.92 nationwide. And, indeed, the last time prices were that high was in October 2014.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut stories about today's gas prices rarely adjust for inflation. When you do that, you find that at $2.92, a gallon of gas costs the same today as it did back in June 1984.During President Obama's 8-years in office, gasoline averaged $3.25 a gallon, in today's dollars. For 14 months during those years, it was above $4 a gallon, which is higher than prices ever reached in the wake of the Iranian revolution. (They peaked at $3.94 in March 1980.)What's more, while Trump is right that OPEC can have an impact on oil prices, the explosion of domestic oil production has dramatically weakened OPEC's hand.That's a result of the fracking revolution, which unlocked vast stores of previously unrecovered oil deposits. Plus, Trump promised when he came into office that he'd remove impediments to still more production, and has taken several steps to do so.As a result, oil companies produced 14% more oil this April than they did when Trump took office. In the first half of this year, they will have produced about as much domestic oil as they did in all of 2009.For those who really do want to see lower gas prices, the answer isn't to complain about Trump's Iran policy, or call for him to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — as some are already doing.The answer is to review the pile of environmental regulations and federal mandates that raise costs. That includes the ethanol mandate, regional air quality rules that have Balkanized gasoline markets in the country, and various EPA rules on what can go into gasoline. The Obama administration's ""Tier 3"" regulations, for example, added as much as 9 cents to a gallon of gas.Regulations made building new refineries almost impossible, resulting in refining capacity dropping from 18.6 million barrels a day in 1981 to 16.8 million by 2005. Obama added to still more refining costs with new regulations imposed in 2015.On top of all this, add state and federal per-gallon taxes, and you see that the government is responsible for a significant portion of gasoline's price.The Trump administration and the Republican Congress could bring gasoline prices down. But only by further enraging their already hysterical political opponents.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsCalifornia's Costly Global Warming Campaign Turns Out To Be Worse Than UselessMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1347,A,"Conagra Brands (CAG) agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF) for about $8.1 billion in cash and stock, gaining freezer-aisle brands such as Birds Eye to capitalize on growing demand for frozen foods.XThe deal values Pinnacle at $68 a share, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The price is 23% above Pinnacle's closing level on April 19, when an activist investor disclosed a stake in the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company and began pushing it to sell itself. Bloomberg News reported last week that Conagra had approached Pinnacle about a deal. Including assumed debt, the deal values Pinnacle at about $10.9 billion.The purchase will give Chicago-based Conagra more exposure to one of the few bright spots in the grocery store: Frozen food sales are growing after years of decline. Even millennials, known for their foodie tastes, are embracing frozen meals, which are convenient and less expensive than takeout. More than half of Pinnacle's revenue comes from frozen brands including Birds Eye, Van de Kamp's and the Gardein line of vegetarian products.The pressure on packaged-food makers to get bigger has intensified in the aftermath of Whole Foods Market's sale last year to Amazon (AMZN). Frozen food, however, is considered relatively resistant to Amazon's push to get shoppers to buy more groceries online because they're tricky to deliver.Conagra's quarterly results, also posted on Wednesday, showed why the company is doubling down on frozen food with the Pinnacle deal. Conagra's refrigerated and frozen segment, with brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice, was the fastest-growing.""The long-awaited deal finally comes together,"" Stifel analyst Christopher Growe, who advises buying Conagra's stock, wrote in a note. ""The nearly $11 billion acquisition creates a powerhouse in the frozen food aisle.""Growe added it was ""a bit surprising"" that the multiple for the deal was lower than recent acquisitions in the food industry and the $68-a-share price came below his expectation of $75.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseActivist fund Jana Partners urged Pinnacle to explore a sale after reporting a 9.5% ke in the packaged food maker in April. The New York-based hedge fund, run by Barry Rosenstein, said in a filing then that it thought the company was in a good position to consider consolidation given its strength in the frozen foods industry.Jana also has history with Conagra, which in 2015 agreed to add two directors to its board in a settlement with the fund. It currently owns a stake in Conagra of less than 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conagra's brands also include Marie Callender's and P.F. Chang's Home Menu.Pinnacle holders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 of a Conagra share for each of their shares. The implied price of $68 is based on the average price for Conagra in the five days ended June 21.In Conagra's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 27, net sales climbed 5.6% to $1.97 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.93 billion.

1349,A,"Leadership isn't about being the person who has all the answers. Quite the opposite. There's nothing wrong with asking for input, seeking help and admitting you don't know it all. It pays to show you're vulnerable.""A leader who acts like he has all the answers isn't approachable,"" said Steve Arneson, who runs his own Boulder, Colo.-based executive coaching and leadership consulting firm. ""But if you're open-minded and not afraid to ask for help, then people know they have the opportunity to weigh in.""Here's how to build that environment.Get participation. Make sure your people are involved in key decisions. Seek help, input and feedback. Say you're looking at both sides of an issue and want to hear what they think.""You have to get past, 'I have all the answers,'"" Arneson said.Set aside ego. Confidence is vital for a leader. But that doesn't mean you know everything. Arneson said the most confident leaders are also often the most likely to show they're vulnerable. They're not afraid to open up, even about their faults.Gain strength. The power inside people can only truly be unleashed if they bring everything they have to their role, says Barry Kaplan, a partner in New York-area executive coaching firm Shift 180. Openness plays a big role.""That includes talking about things that might be dangerous or risky,"" Kaplan, co-author of ""The Power of Vulnerability,"" told IBD.Be clear. Build an open and trusting environment by first talking about it.

It might be about saving money or why one person hasn't been fired. Then talk about that point in a forum where there is no fear of retribution.""There's a lot of pent-up truth that's ready to be unleashed,"" Kaplan said. ""There's courage involved in being vulnerable and speaking my truth. But if I'm authentic it makes me feel good about myself.""Stay true. Be consistent in how you act and treat people. And stick to your values while doing that.""That produces a track record of behavior that people can bank on,"" Arneson said. ""Then when they walk in on Monday morning, they know who they're getting.""Spread the word. Build authenticity into your group's culture by displaying it yourself, so others see it starts at the top. Talk about it every chance you get: in meetings, through a CEO blog and at employee celebrations.""The cool thing about authenticity is you don't have to think about it,"" Arneson said. ""It just comes naturally.""Win faith. If you're open about your weaknesses, you'll earn trust among your team.""Then you'll create a powerful team because people will have each other's back,"" Kaplan said.Take the lead. If the company chief doesn't show vulnerability and authenticity, others won't either. But if she does, it'll spread fast.Kaplan once worked with the leader of an auto parts company who was at a crossroads about whether to shut the doors or keep investing. The boss spoke openly to his people about his dilemma. They opened up about their fears and their staunch belief the company could recover from its slump. The boss decided to invest more in the company.""His people believed more in him because he was willing to say, 'I don't know,'"" Kaplan said. ""He couldn't have been more real. And they ended up having their best year ever.""Reap rewards. Once you open up to the point that you build trust, the benefits pour in.""Then you have an environment that's going to lead to improved performance,"" Kaplan said. ""One new idea leads to creativity and innovation, or you can cut your losses earlier if your company was going to do something that doesn't work.""

To this day, the Treasury Department stores taxpayer data on an old IBM mainframe that has less processing power than a smartphone. And Veterans Affairs still tracks benefit claims using a 50-year-old programming language.These are just a few examples of the government's woefully outdated equipment and software. This technology frequently malfunctions, putting lives at risk — and costing taxpayers billions every year. A 2016 GAO report found that about three-quarters of the government's $80 billion information technology budget went toward keeping ancient technology working.It's time for the government to embrace 21st-century technologies.Several proven technologies could immediately improve government operations.Take blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a system for recording transactions. Think of it as a giant spreadsheet shared across many computers. Every entry has a record of who made it and when, rendering hacking nearly impossible. Blockchain records all transactions instantly; no paper or physical signatures required. That makes transactions faster, simpler and more accurate.Many countries have already embraced blockchain systems. Sweden, Honduras and Georgia use it to track real estate transactions. Sierra Leone switched its election system to blockchain to prevent fraud. The United Arab Emirates just announced a major plan to complete half of government transactions on a blockchain platform by 2021. The plan will save $3 billion on routine transactions and 77 million work hours each year.The public sector could also provide better service to citizens by embracing artificial intelligence.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Federal employees have little incentive to innovate. And bureaucratic red tape makes innovation all but impossible.The government would benefit from a major culture shift.

1355,A,"Even Indiana Jones would probably have given up.Howard Carter and his team dug through hundreds of boulders in Egypt's Valley of the Kings for about five arduous years, looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun. His research told him the tomb was there. But no one — not even he — could find it thousands of years after the child king's death. Carter's once enthusiastic financial backer was losing patience.But in one of history's greatest examples of persistence with a massive payoff, Carter removed rubble that revealed the entrance of the tomb on Nov. 25, 1922. His discovery is still considered the most significant archaeological feat in modern times, Tarek El-Awady, curator of the ""King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh"" exhibit, told IBD in an email sent from Egypt. ""Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun still stands as the greatest discovery made by man,"" El-Awady said.The valuable treasures Carter found still draw crowds to museums around the world. But what Carter did to achieve his goals and persevere is equally priceless, including:Carter was never formally trained as an archaeologist or even a scientist. He was the son of an artist and an artist himself. But he learned about archaeology on the job after he was hired at the age of 17 to draw Egyptian artifacts for a wealthy family. His skill as an artist won him a spot traveling to Egypt alongside some of the best archaeologists of all time, including Percy Newberry. From them he learned how to carefully excavate and catalog a dig's artifacts. This knowledge, paired with his previous training as an artist, created a powerful blend of skill sets that few in the world possessed. ""He learned a lot on the job. You can't learn it until you're standing there having to do it,"" Pearce Creasman, associate professor and director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona told IBD. ""He put all the pieces together and learned from all these people and added his special skill (of drawing) to the mix.""Carter's skill set was so unique that he commanded respect on digs and was later named chief inspector for the Egyptian Antiquities Service — a position that would set him up for success later.From Newberry and others, Carter learned the importance of being highly detailed in cataloging everything he found. His journals of findings are richly illustrated in painstaking detail — a standard practice in archaeology today — but perhaps seen as excessive or even obsessive in the day.To capture every detail, Carter developed a breakthrough system of classifying digs that culminated with the King Tut discovery. Every group of objects found was designated with a number from one to 620, Nicholas Reeves and John Taylor wrote in ""Howard Carter Before Tutankhamun."" Smaller groups of items found were then notated with single or multiple letters, such as a, b, c, aa, bb, cc and aaa, bbb, ccc.Again, this was Carter applying his talents to something he learned from someone else. Carter ""learned excavation with British excavator Flinders Petrie, who taught him the importance of small finds,"" Brian Fagen, an archaeologist and emeritus professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, told IBD. ""Researchers working on the tomb still consult his notebooks, which are an exceptional record, far ahead of their time.""Carter closely observed and took valuable tips from ""experts."" But just as importantly, he knew what to ignore, too. Theodore Davis, a wealthy U.S. attorney and successful archaeologist whom Carter was working with, declared in the early 1910s that all the great finds in the Valley of the Kings already had been found.Carter disregarded Davis' ""expert opinion."" Carter's own experience proved to be just as precious, if not more than Davis'. Carter ""was a maverick operator, stubborn, ambitious and brimming with self-confidence,"" William Cross, author of ""Carnarvon, Carter and Tutankhamun Revisited: The Hidden Truths and Doomed Relationships,"" told IBD. ""His know-how, spark and ingenuity convinced him that the tomb of Tutankhamun was somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.""After Davis gave up on the dig, Carter had to find another backer to fund a continued search.Carter quit his stable job as an inspector for the Egyptian archaeological service in 1905 to free up time for his search. Some of the hardest years of his life followed.Carter's quest for the tomb was almost an obsession. But he knew that to complete it he would need financial backing. After Davis left the quest, Carter teamed up with a new financial supporter, wealthy Briton Lord Carnarvon. The difficulty was convincing him to keep writing the checks even as Carter found nothing year after year.When Carnarvon grew frustrated and was about to cut off Carter's financing, Carter modified his approach to appeal to Carnarvon's sense as an investor. In those times, archaeologist teams kept half of what they found and returned the remainder to Egypt. Carter knew the cost of financing another dig was a fraction of the reward possible if they found the tomb. He explained the economics to Carnarvon and said if he wouldn't pay to keep digging, Carter would from his own pocket. The pitch was so compelling — blending economic reasoning with scientific precision — it convinced Carnarvon to keep writing the checks. ""He got one guy to buy in and sometimes that's all it takes, is one person to make something really big happen,"" Creasman said.Carter's sharp tongue might have made it difficult to sell his idea, but he ""was smart enough and eloquent enough in tales about Tutankhamun's lost tomb to be enticed and trusted by millionaire investors looking to cash in on antiquities, and the glint of gold to come,"" Cross said.Just imagining your success isn't going to do much. Success comes to those who visualize how to get there. Carter provides an example. While still antiquities inspector, Carter looked back and examined all the successful digs in the Valley of the Kings. Not just his, but everyone's. Most archaeologists randomly dug. But Carter applied his detailed grid-block system of analysis to past discoveries. This allowed him to build a holistic picture in his mind of what was explored, and what wasn't. By ""retroactively applying to all the work done in the Valley of the Kings … he knew areas that other people had missed,"" Creasman said. By studying past records, Carter knew others ""dug 10 feet to the right and 20 feet to the left, and 15 feet over here. They had not dug everything, everywhere.""Perhaps it was another example of how Carter elevated archaeology by blending facets of his unique mind as an artist would. Carter's attention to detail allowed him to visualize what parts of the valley were ""clean territory — an area no one has ever excavated,"" Creasman said.""He had this map in his head, along with internal motivation,"" Creasman said. ""I haven't done everything I can do until I've done this. When people obsess on a thing, they can't let it go.""Carter loved his life's work — ever since starting out as an artist. That passion drove him to keep looking and learning. Others who were purely driven by money would have given up. ""Working in the Valley of the Kings is like magic, the silence and the absolute power of the cliffs surrounding the valley makes every Egyptologist willing to spend his entire life working and working, running after a dream that might or might not ever come true,"" El-Awady said.His passion yielded success even when he wasn't trying. In addition to exploring and drawing, Carter loved horses and riding the west bank of Luxor, El-Awady says. ""One of his greatest discoveries happened when the leg of his horse got stuck in a hole that turned out to be the symbolic burial of King Mentuhotep II (Dynasty 11),"" El-Awady said. ""In this tomb, the beautiful statue of the king was discovered.""Carter brought ""long-term planning, the need for a disciplined approach to finding and excavating sites, and the necessity for recording everything with photographs, drawings, or in writing,"" Fagen said. ""He really was one of the first modern archaeologists, with a unique eye for detail, and always a mind for the long-term outcome of the project.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Apply your unique interests and abilities to your profession to reinvent what's possible.Overcame: Many failed attempts to find King Tut's tomb and loss of financial backing""All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself.""

In this case, inclisiran works to inhibit synthesis of the PCSK9 protein in liver cells. High LDL cholesterol has ties to the PCSK9 protein.Fellow biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron with its partner Sanofi (SNY) also have approved medicines that work to block the PCSK9 protein. Further, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) is working on another type of LDL cholesterol drug called bempedoic acid.The market for LDL cholesterol drugs could be huge. Amusa predicts Medicines' inclisiran will be a blockbuster. He models $4.7 billion in peak sales in 2030.Amusa sees Medicines' commercial plan to administering inclisiran every six months as being favorable compared to rival drugs from other biotech companies. Patients on Amgen's Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent receive injections every two weeks or monthly.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also expects the dosing schedule for inclisiran to challenge biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron.""From a commercial perspective, an every six-month regimen for (an LDL cholesterol drug) is disruptive — especially at the steep price discount Medicines intends to come in at,"" he said in a report to clients.Amgen shares dipped 0.6%, to 183.53, and Regeneron advanced 2.9%, to 336.61, on Wednesday.

1358,A,"Stocks dug into substantial early losses early Tuesday, as an intensifying U.S.-China trade spat triggered a deep sell-off across Asian stock markets. China trade-sensitive stocks, including Boeing (BA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), posted heavy declines on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.A broad range of China stocks spearheaded the early losses. JD.com (JD), Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU), Huya (HUYA) and JinkoSolar (JKS) were among the deepest decliners.The Dow Jones industrial avereage came off opening lows, but was down 1.2% shortly after the start of trade. Boeing and Caterpillar (CAT) led the downside. More than half of the Dow's 30 issues fell more than 1%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each shed 0.7%. About a dozen S&P 500 names sold down more than 2%. China trade sensitive names CF Industries (CF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and General Motors (GM) fell furthest.China names were among the Nasdaq's worst decliners. JD.com, NetEase and Baidu had three of the Nasdaq 100's four worst losses.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors continued to ping-pong on U.S.-China news, as the Senate passed a bill Monday that would reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been attempting to acquire the NXP in a $43 billion deal which China's regulators reportedly approved last week. But the approval had been hitched to President Trump's forgiving ZTE for its violations of trade sanctions vs. North Korea. On Tuesday, NXP dropped 1.8% to one of the Nasdaq 100's deepest early losses. Qualcomm was down 1.6%.The Dow has five straight declines under its belt, falling back below the 25,000 level on Monday. The index appears headed for a break of its 50-day line at Tuesday's open, although premarket action does not always follow through into regular trade.  The S&P 500 ended Monday 3% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq remains just a fraction off Thursday's high, and 5% above its 50-day level.With 25% tariffs on $50 billion on imports from China set to kick in on July 6, China has said it would impose equal penalties on U.S. imports. If those tariffs go into place, President Trump on Monday said he would increase the scope of U.S. tariffs to $200 billion worth of China goods.As a result, Asian stock markets careened lower Tuesday. The yuan dropped to a five-month low against the dollar and investors scrambled to get out of the way of the worsening trade dispute. The Shanghai Composite swooned 3.8%, the Shenzhen Composite dived 5.3% as more than 1,000 stocks hit their daily 10% loss maximum circuit breaker. The selling quickly infected Japan's market, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plummeted 1.8%, cutting below its 50-day moving average.Asia's rout moderated somewhat in Europe, where markets traded sharply lower in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX fell hardest, down 1.3%. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.2% in the red, while London's FTSE 100 dimmed 0.5%.Sellers went after a number of China-based stocks in early U.S. trade. JinkoSolar dropped more than 4%. JD.com, Ctrip and Weibo (WB) all showed losses deeper than 3%.  Among the scorching-hot trio of China IPOs: Huya, iQiyi (IQ) and Bilibili (BILI), gtwo reversed premarket losses and punched higher: Huya gained a fraction. IQiyi scored a 3% gain. All three stocks are due for price consolidation, and pullbacks could present investors with buy opportunities.Another China-based IPO, Sogou (SOGO), broke out on Friday, then retook its cup-base buy point Monday in a huge-volume gain. Shares dropped 3.8% before Tuesday's open, holding just above the base's 14.80 buy point.China names also led the early declines among IBD 50 stocks. China Lodging (HTHT) dropped 3.6%. YY (YY) fell 1.9%. Momo (MOMO) dumped 3.7%. The declines did not do significant damage to the charts of either China Lodging or Momo.The loss dealt a setback to YY, which has been struggling to build the right side of a three-month base pattern.On the Dow, Boeing unraveled 3.2%, cutting below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade. The stock is trading below a 365.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A fall below 335.89 would trigger the automatic sell rule.Verizon (VZ) scored one of the Dow's lonely early gains, rising 1%. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy, from hold. Verizon has been attempting to start up the right side of a four-month base pattern.China-based Autohome (ATHM) notched the deepest early loss among IBD Leaderboard names. Autohome dived 3.9% at Tuesday's open. The stock is extended after clearing an ascending-base buy point at 107.64 on May 30.In economic news, U.S. housing starts jumped more than expected in May. The Commerce Department reported starts rising to an annualized rate of 1.35 million for the month, up from 1.286 million in April and above consensus forecasts for an increase to 1.32 million.Building permits, which gauge upcoming building activity, slipped to an annualized pace of 1.301 million.

The stock outperformed broader biotech companies, which sank nearly 3%. Medicines stock broke out of a cup-with-handle at 32.50 last month.Confidence is growing in drugs like inclisiran, which work by RNA interference, Amusa said. In this case, inclisiran works to inhibit synthesis of the PCSK9 protein in liver cells. High LDL cholesterol has ties to the PCSK9 protein.Fellow biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron with its partner Sanofi (SNY) also have approved medicines that work to block the PCSK9 protein. Further, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) is working on another type of LDL cholesterol drug called bempedoic acid.The market for LDL cholesterol drugs could be huge. Amusa predicts Medicines' inclisiran will be a blockbuster. He models $4.7 billion in peak sales in 2030.Amusa sees Medicines' commercial plan to administering inclisiran every six months as being favorable compared to rival drugs from other biotech companies. Patients on Amgen's Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent receive injections every two weeks or monthly.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also expects the dosing schedule for inclisiran to challenge biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron.""From a commercial perspective, an every six-month regimen for (an LDL cholesterol drug) is disruptive — especially at the steep price discount Medicines intends to come in at,"" he said in a report to clients.Amgen shares dipped 0.6%, to 183.53, and Regeneron advanced 2.9%, to 336.61, on Wednesday. Regeneron's rise likely stemmed from a pair of upgrades this week.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

1362,A,"America's nuclear weapons system ran on floppy disks until 2017. To this day, the Treasury Department stores taxpayer data on an old IBM mainframe that has less processing power than a smartphone. And Veterans Affairs still tracks benefit claims using a 50-year-old programming language.These are just a few examples of the government's woefully outdated equipment and software. This technology frequently malfunctions, putting lives at risk — and costing taxpayers billions every year. A 2016 GAO report found that about three-quarters of the government's $80 billion information technology budget went toward keeping ancient technology working.It's time for the government to embrace 21st-century technologies.Several proven technologies could immediately improve government operations.Take blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a system for recording transactions. Think of it as a giant spreadsheet shared across many computers. Every entry has a record of who made it and when, rendering hacking nearly impossible. Blockchain records all transactions instantly; no paper or physical signatures required. That makes transactions faster, simpler and more accurate.Many countries have already embraced blockchain systems. Sweden, Honduras and Georgia use it to track real estate transactions. Sierra Leone switched its election system to blockchain to prevent fraud. The United Arab Emirates just announced a major plan to complete half of government transactions on a blockchain platform by 2021. The plan will save $3 billion on routine transactions and 77 million work hours each year.The public sector could also provide better service to citizens by embracing artificial intelligence.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany citizens call Medicaid, the DMV, Social Security and other agencies to ask simple questions. Do I qualify for a certain benefit? Has the application deadline passed? What's my password?Callers often must wade through long waits and endless menu options to get an answer from a human representative. A smart machine could handle those queries much faster and at a lower cost.Some local governments have already started using AI for exactly this purpose. Los Angeles is experimenting with a smart chatbot to answer basic business tax and regulation questions. And Mississippi allows residents to use Amazon Alexa to get information on taxes and car registration.Importantly, incorporating AI into customer service calls would free staffers to deal with requests that actually require human problem-solving and empathy — helping someone, say, secure unemployment benefits or find the right school for her child.Unfortunately, the government is moving at a snail's pace to incorporate such technology. Federal employees have little incentive to innovate. And bureaucratic red tape makes innovation all but impossible.The government would benefit from a major culture shift. Top officials ought to recognize the potential of new technology and commit to changing business-as-usual. And employees should be rewarded for efforts to boost innovation, transparency, and accuracy of operations.Such reforms would also help the government recruit young tech workers who have fresh ideas for improving services. The federal workforce is shockingly old: There are more than four times as many IT specialists over the age of 60 as specialists under 30.The government's reluctance to embrace modern technologies results in inefficient services and wastes billions of dollars.

1364,A,"Boeing (BA) is reportedly considering development of two twin-aisle, midrange planes for what analysts have dubbed the ""797"" and is seeking proposals from engine makers.XThe aerospace giant still hasn't decided whether to go forward with what it calls a New Middle Market Airplane, or the NMA, as it tries to answer Airbus' (EADSY) A320neo. But details have emerged for two types of aircraft.One aircraft called the NMA-6X would seat 228 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles, while the other plane, the NMA-7X, would seat 267 in two classes, but the range would be 800 nautical miles shorter, sources told Air Current.Boeing is looking for an engine that would burn 25% less fuel per pound of thrust vs. the engines on the 757, according to the report, and gave engine makers CFM International, a General Electric (GE)-Safran joint venture, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt and Whitney and the U.K.'s Rolls-Royce until June 27 to submit final proposals.Boeing shares edged down 0.45% at 329.82 on the stock market today, giving up gains amid a broad market reversal. GE rose 1.6%, United Tech fell 1% and Airbus' U.S.-listed shares lost 1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEngines are typically picked closer to the first order date. But sources told the Air Current that Boeing is making the engine decision well ahead of its possible launch.Boeing is having trouble with engine suppliers, who have struggled to keep up with rising production rates and addressing technical problems.Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce found another compressor flaw in its engine for some Boeing 787s, and Pratt and Whitney is struggling to boost production of its geared turbofan engine. GE is also in the midst of a massive restructuring.On June 20 Randy Tinseth, Boeing's VP of marketing, told IBD in Seattle that the current problems with engine makers won't affect the possibility of future deals. He called the issues a ""manageable situation.""Boeing has been shopping the midmarket airplane idea around to carriers for over a year. But few details have emerged about the new plane, which analysts are dubbing the ""797.""Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg last year confirmed that the new plane could seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles. If the plane gets the green light for production, it wouldn't enter service until 2025.Tinseth wouldn't give more details about what airlines wanted from the new plane but said after speaking to 50 customers ""we are now at the point where we pretty much understand what they want.""""Our steps moving forward — can we develop a production system that makes sense. And once we develop that production system will the business case come together,"" he said.At the National Press Club in Washington D.C., Wednesday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian reaffirmed earlier statements that Delta wants to be a launch customer if Boeing goes ahead with the new plane to replace aging 767s and 757s that are set to retire in the next decade.""We have had discussion about being a potential launch customer but it would be premature to make any comment along those lines,"" he said. ""But we think Boeing is interested in getting a feel of the market.""Bastian wouldn't go into specifics about what the carrier wants from a ""797"" but he said he wants range and capacity at a low price point for customers.""Don't want an overload. Sometimes you build an aircraft with too much capability and too much range and that's when it becomes more expensive and you're suboptimal.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch

1365,A,"EVERETT, Wash. — The Boeing (BA) 787 Dreamliner has opened up 180 new markets for the aerospace giant's customers in the last six years, according to Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing.XWhile the 787s entered commercial service in 2011 years behind schedule and after development costs that reportedly topped $30 billion, the planes' lighter composite materials and cutting-edge engines transformed the cost-benefit analysis of intercontinental travel in planes smaller than jumbo jets like the 747.""They bring a blend of size and efficiency and operating costs that allows our customers to open up new routes that hadn't been profitable with older airplanes,"" Tinseth told IBD in an interview recently at Boeing's massive plant near Seattle.The explosion of new routes also confirmed Boeing's bet more than a decade earlier that more direct point-to-point travel would drive demand. Meanwhile, rival Airbus (EADSY) invested about $30 billion in its superjumbo A380, betting that the hub-and-spoke model, in which passengers have layovers at top-tier airports to catch connecting flights, would continue.Airbus has since answered the 787 with its A350-XWB and is struggling to maintain demand for the A380. But its A320neo narrow-body jet has enabled new intercontinental flights as well, forcing Boeing to come up with an answer in that class.Here are five surprising new direct routes for the 787:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTravel to top eastern Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai have always been popular. But now the 787 has opened up routes in western China deeper in the country's interior.Despite being unfamiliar to many Americans, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, is more populous than any U.S. city. Now passengers can fly to Chengdu from Los Angeles' LAX and New York's JFK, thanks to 787s in Hainan Airlines's fleet.There is also an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Chengdu as China extends its presence in Africa, where key industrial minerals are mined.""The long thin routes ... like secondary markets in the U.S. or lesser known cities in China, they are growing about five times faster than the markets to and from those big hubs,"" Tinseth said.The 787 has also enabled new flights to second-tier cities in China's southeast, like Shenzhen, Fuzhou and Xiamen.In March, Qantas Airways launched the 9,000-mile, nonstop flight on a Boeing Dreamliner. It was the first direct air link between the two continents. And the route is the third-longest commercial passenger flight in operation as well as the world's longest Dreamliner flight.Airlines are also using Airbus' offerings for long haul flights. Singapore Airlines will relaunch a Singapore-to-Newark, N.J., flight in October with the Airbus A350-900ULR. Singapore Airlines served this route previously in a less efficient Airbus A340-500. The high cost of operating the nearly 9,000-mile distance forced the airline to abandon the route in 2013.Tinseth said he hopes that eventually there will be a Sydney to London flight. But the route is ""a really long way.""Other innovations on the 787 help it serve long-haul trips, such as the plane's ability to optimize humidity levels in the cabin.""The efficiency has made a difference and frankly the passenger experience on these new aircraft like the 787 provide the opportunity for customers to be more comfortable,"" Tinseth said.There were already direct flights between London and most major cities in the U.S. before the Dreamliner's debut. But when it came to secondary cities with high passenger volume, New Orleans ranked near the top. British Airways now flies there from Heathrow.""There are enough people in London and people connecting through Europe who want to go to New Orleans, but the fares aren't high,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly. Most are vacation travelers not the more lucrative business travelers.With a fairly large volume of travelers that want low fares, taking a larger, more-expensive plane wouldn't make sense economically.""With the Dreamliner you have an aircraft with only a modest number of seats that could fly a really long distance and do it with excellent economics per seat mile basis,"" Kaplan said.Low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle flies between Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Barcelona in Spain. Norwegian also serves Oakland, Calif., from Denmark's capital Copenhagen.Kaplan noted that it's cheaper to operate from airports in Ft. Lauderdale and Oakland vs. their neighbors like Miami and San Francisco.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks Near A Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day

""But as a firm, and as an active manager, we don't just think indexes are flawed in fixed income, we think they're broken.""The weight of individual securities in fixed-income indexes is often determined by debt issued, meaning companies that issue more debt will have a higher weight in an index-based ETF.""That doesn't necessarily mean they're the best companies, but they would be the ones that a passive manager would have to overweight,"" said O'Connor, who manages Franklin Templeton's $1.5 billion ETF platform.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1367,A,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were among all 35 banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, clearing a major hurdle toward huge hikes in capital returns.The Federal Reserve said the nation's largest banks are strongly capitalized, though Goldman Sachs (GS) came the closest to missing the mark, posting a leverage ratio of 3.1% vs. the Fed's minimum requirement of 3%.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a press release.The Dodd-Frank stress test results detail whether banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. This is the first of two tests. On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo dipped 0.2%, while Citigroup gained 0.4%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 0.2%.After the close, Wells Fargo edged up, while the others fell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoldman analysts see State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Not everyone is quite so bullish, however. The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve. This could lower profits, as banks make money on the difference between long- and short-term rates.

1375,A,"SEATTLE — New Zealand will buy four Boeing (BA) P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare planes, as the U.S. ally steps up operations in the South China Sea.The P-8s, which will replace New Zealand's P-3 Orion fleet, will cost $1.6 billion and include training. They will be ready for operations starting in 2023.The order comes as New Zealand and other U.S. allies look to counter China's more aggressive stance in the region.Boeing stock rose 2.2% to 341.92 on the stock market today, still below its 50-day moving average.The U.S. Navy is the biggest customer for the P-8 and has 120 planes on order. But international sales can help keep costs down.""What we are doing is bundling U.S. Navy and international customers together so the U.S. Navy and the international customers get that lower unit price,"" Stephen Tripp, senior manager of global sales for the P-8 told IBD during a visit to the factory in June.  ""It's a challenge to bring new customers in a time that works for them clearly but also that works well in this collective bargaining.""Lower costs aren't the only advantage as tensions rise in the South China Sea and with Russia.""Everyone flying those jets work perfectly well with one another — compatible, interoperable; working together, all flying P-8s can share maintenance facilities,"" Tripp said.More foreign sales are expected soon and Tripp said his goal was to have two to three more customers signed up in the next two years.South Korea picked the P-8 in a contract worth $1.71 billion, a Boeing official told Reuters last month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTripp said it was difficult to determine the exact timing of foreign orders as the State Department and Congress must approve all foreign military sales before the contracts become official. Only then can Boeing start work on the surveillance planes.Other potential customers include Saudi Arabia. During President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom last year, Riyadh announced $110 billion in tentative arms deals, including the P-8.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Boeing's Seattle-area facilities during his U.S. tour earlier this year.Turkey is looking for a longer-range patrol aircraft to supplement existing planes. But military hardware sales to Turkey are in question as Congress considers blocking the sale of the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jet.The P-8 is a modified Boeing 737-800ERX, replacing Lockheed's P-3 Orion turboprop. The aircraft uses a high-power radar to scan for ships and submarines and a modified radar from the Boeing EA-18 Growler to scan for targets on land or near the coasts.Once a submarine is spotted, the aircraft can deploy sonobuoys to track and relay information about the location of hostile submarines. Or the plane can launch weapons like the Raytheon (RTN) Mark 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedo or Boeing's AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile. Winged torpedoes with a GPS guidance system are in development.Demand for anti-submarine capabilities is rising as China has accelerated its submarine building, increasing tensions in the South China Sea. Russia used submarines to launch strikes in Syria and has increased submarine activity in Europe.But the P-8 also assists in search and rescue efforts. It was involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, in 2014 and Argentina's missing submarine in 2017.The body of the jet is built in Boeing's current 737 production line in Renton, but with some modifications like a thicker skin, stiffer wings and a bomb bay door. Then the jet is flown down the street to the P-8 facility near Boeing Field.There it gets militarized and completes final testing. While 47 737s are built per month at the commercial factory, the P-8 facility completes 1.5 P-8s per month.Raytheon was up 0.7% and Lockheed wasn't active early.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchBoeing Must Clear This Last Hurdle Before Delivering Delayed KC-46 TankersIBD Stock Of The Day

1376,A,"Oil prices and stocks, led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and California Resources (CRC), surged after OPEC agreed to increase production next month, though the vagueness of the deal underscored the fissures in the oil group.XOPEC producers and allies like Russia will aim to increase output by about 1 million barrels per day, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters, though the actual increase is likely to be smaller as countries like Venezuela struggle to ramp up. S&P Global Platts expects a net output increase of around 700,000 bpd, largely met by Saudi Arabia.But OPEC's official statement on the decision didn't provide a specific number for the production increase. Instead, the statement said producers will more closely adhere to an earlier deal to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day. Since that deal was struck in 2016, participants have substantially overshot that target, with the reduction estimated at 2.8 million bpd.Despite the mixed signals coming from OPEC, the highly awaited policy decision Friday is bullish for oil prices as the planned output boost will bring markets closer to balance, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.But he also found the contentious run-up to Friday's decision telling, as Iran had threatened to veto proposals to boost output.""OPEC is not the unified group it once was, they are all different interests and different capabilities,"" said Youngberg, who sees the introduction of electric vehicles and rise in U.S. shale production further crimping OPEC's leadership in the years ahead.He added that politics are more of an issue within OPEC now, with Russia playing both sides of the Iran-Saudi Arabia geopolitical rivalry.Last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, notably began looking at forging their own, separate agreement on energy cooperation.U.S. crude oil prices jumped 4.6% to settle at $68.58 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 3.4% to $75.55 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell spiked 4.4% on the stock market today. Marathon Oil leapt 8%, and shale producer California Resources soared 10%. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) gained 2%, and BP (BP) surged 3.7%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOther details from Friday's agreement were left vague, such as how the increase will affect member countries at the individual level, focusing instead on a collective target.""It's an elegant solution to the problem they have had, where some countries have not been able to increase and some have lost production,"" said Roger Diwan, energy analyst at IHS Markit. ""They don't have to renegotiate quotas,"" bypassing a thorny issue and avoiding antagonizing OPEC members who can't produce, he added.What OPEC achieved, he added, ""is trying to keep (Brent crude) prices in a narrow range and not to cross $80+.""Ahead of OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Friday, divisions within the oil cartel threw the outcome into uncertainty up to the last minute.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia sought to boost output again. But Iran was stubbornly opposed to a boost, as renewed U.S. sanctions would prevent it from selling more oil anyway. Other OPEC members like Venezuela and Iraq also signaled they weren't on board with an increase.OPEC was able to overcome objections by Iran and others to production increases by framing their decision as a return to the originally agreed 1.8 million bpd cuts, S&P Global Platts noted.""The fact that we dealt with overcompliance (on cutback commitments) that was worrying the industry … this is what made the deliberations meaningful,"" OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei of the United Arab Emirates said in a press conference Friday.On Saturday, OPEC and its non-member partners will hold another meeting to ratify today's agreement.Meanwhile, the OPEC decision is unlikely to drive any strategic shift from American shale companies in the near term, Youngberg said.In the past year, many companies have promised to prioritize spending discipline over production expansion after previously rushing to pump more oil when prices recovered.""Shale plays are focused really on living within their cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders,"" reflected in their debt reduction, dividends and buybacks, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Today's approval of Epidiolex is a historic milestone, offering patients and their families the first and only FDA-approved (cannabidiol) medicine to treat two severe, childhood-onset epilepsies,"" he said in a written statement.Epidiolex is derived directly from the cannabis plant. It contains cannabidiol, or CBD, rather than tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. THC is the chemical responsible for marijuana's euphoric high. GW calls Epidiolex the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs.But that means the DEA will have to reschedule Epidiolex from its current Schedule 1 status.

In September, Zogenix reported strong results from a Phase 3 study of its Dravet syndrome treatment. The drug reduced monthly convulsive seizures by 72% compared to 17% for those on the placebo, he wrote.""While acknowledging there are no head-to-head studies and there are significant differences in patient populations between the Zogenix and GW Dravet studies, consider that Epidiolex showed a 39% reduction in seizures vs. 13% for placebo in its Phase 3 Dravet study,"" he said.Trbovich has a sell rating on GW stock.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1380,A,"In Part 1, I described the vendetta by the Russian government's propaganda apparatus against technologies like fracking and modern genetic engineering techniques applied to agriculture, and the aid the Russians receive from U.S.-based organic industry lobbyists and activists.Second Of Two Parts. (Read Part 1.)We ended Part 1 with the observation that advocacy, which we see in many industries and special-interest groups, is one thing, but character assassination, trolling and intimidation are something else. That crosses the line. We discuss that here.Overall, the organic industry's propaganda campaign has achieved impressive gains — if you consider ripping off consumers and character assassination to be positive.Academics Review, a science-oriented nonprofit organization of academic experts, performed a review of hundreds of published academic, industry, and government research reports concerned with consumers' views of organic products.It also looked at more than 1,500 news reports, marketing materials, advocacy propaganda, speeches, etc., generated between 1988 and 2014 about organic foods.Their analysis found that ""consumers have spent hundreds of billion dollars purchasing premium-priced organic food products based on false or misleading perceptions about comparative product food safety, nutrition and health attributes,"" and that this is due to ""a widespread organic and natural products industry pattern of research-informed and intentionally deceptive marketing and paid advocacy.""That advocacy is particularly vile. The organic industry seeks not a level playing field for their products; instead, they try to level the players on the other side. The activists regularly trot out a litany of false accusations about their enemies.One of the most unlikely and undeserving targets is Stephan Neidenbach, a Maryland middle-school teacher and science communicator who blogs about science and technology. The trolls and character assassins variously tried to get him fired and conducted a campaign of harassment and intimidation against him. Read his chilling account here.Academics have been a favorite target. An NGO called U.S. Right to Know, or USRTK, has filed harassing Freedom of Information requests for emails and documents of at least a hundred public university faculty and staff members, hoping to find embarrassing snippets that might imply conflicts of interest.Their efforts to undermine scientists and public policy scholars whose work threatens the Russians' agenda follow a familiar pattern. In the words of University of Florida plant biologist Kevin Folta, who has been excoriated repeatedly by USRTK for supposedly being a Monsanto sock puppet, the activists ""develop a narrative that suggests industry collusion or undue influence, especially with any attempt to connect the faculty member to Monsanto, a company that is the bogeyman favorite of activists.""Every page of every email requested by USRTK must be examined by attorneys to ascertain whether they are releasable. Professor Folta estimates that the USRTK fishing expedition may have cost his university as much as a million dollars of taxpayers' money.Another prominent victim was Peter Phillips, Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at the University of Saskatchewan, whose supposed sin was (surprise!) too close a relationship with Monsanto and allowing the company to influence what he said and wrote.Other eminent academics, such as University of Illinois Professor (Emeritus) Bruce Chassy and University of Oklahoma Law Professor (Emeritus) Drew Kershen and science writer extraordinaire Jon Entine have also been targeted.I have been on the USRTK hit-list since I was a prominent opponent of an unscientific, unwise and probably unconstitutional 2012 California referendum issue that would have required labeling of genetically engineered food.USRTK were proponents of the measure. Paid pro-referendum activists lied effusively about me in the campaign, and some of their more flagrant falsehoods were regurgitated by the New York Times' hapless food columnist, Mark Bittman, apparently without any fact-checking.Fast forward to 2015, when a UN-based agency erroneously categorized the herbicide glyphosate (which Monsanto markets as Roundup) as a ""probable carcinogen."" Although Monsanto and I had a long history of mutual antagonism (see this and this, for example) a scientist acquaintance there emailed me and asked if that was something I might write about.I responded that I was overwhelmed with various projects but that they should sent me a ""high-quality draft,"" a poor choice of words by which I meant stuff — other government agencies' evaluations, scientific studies, as well as the company's view of the decision. Eventually, they sent me all of that.When those emails were later released as part of a lawsuit in 2017, a New York Times reporter whom I (along with many in the scientific community) had criticized repeatedly for biased and inaccurate reporting, penned a vindictive hit-piece implying that my op-ed was ghostwritten. The Times article was misleading and incomplete.In a phone conversation — which, of course, is not reflected in the emails — I had told a Monsanto person exactly what arguments and points I wanted to make, and they sent me a rough draft that consisted almost entirely of what I had outlined. I then modified and published it as an op-ed.In the end, the ideas, opinions and words were my own. (Moreover, the article was in every respect accurate and, for once, reflected the views of both the scientific community and industry.)Let me be clear: I have authored three books, scores of journal articles and more than a thousand columns for the popular press (including, by the way, for the New York Times) and nobody has ghostwritten any of them.The University of Florida's Kevin Folta has characterized the activists' goal as leaving ""these trusted professors, dietitians and physicians 'Google Dead', a state where their online reputation will always drag the anchor of activist derision.""Professor Folta describes how these campaigns work: ""In the case of (University of Saskatchewan Professor) Phillips, US-RTK acquired emails and used Jason Warick from CBC News as a complicit pipeline to media. This way it is not simply (USRTK co-director) Gary Ruskin and his band of industry-financed lackeys slandering scientists on activist websites. Instead, it takes (on) the patina of legitimate research, hard-core gumshoe reporting. It really is a reporter doing the bidding of US-RTK, who is doing the bidding of a handful of organizations, companies, and undisclosed donors paying for the hit.""New Yorker staff writer Adrian Chen describes what happened to him in 2015 while he was doing background research in St. Petersburg about Russia's notorious ""troll farm,"" the Internet Research Agency:""As I conducted my reporting, I was myself the target of an elaborate smear campaign to label me a neo-Nazi sympathizer and U.S. intelligence agent — an early use of the kind of bizarre tactics that have been documented by numerous investigations in both the Russian and Western media, and by the internal investigations of social-media companies.""Thus, American activists and NGOs, paid by the organic agriculture industry and aided by Russia's propaganda machine, routinely trash, troll and harass scientists, academics, journalists and even middle-school teachers who promote sound science generally and promulgate accurate information about genetic engineering, in particular.The character-assassination campaigns present an exquisite irony: USRTK and its ilk accuse their targets of being shills — paid agents of the agribusiness industry who have a conflict of interest — but it is they who are the shills, bought and paid for by the organic and ""natural products"" industries.The fake-news-based disinformation campaigns launched by the NGOs and other trolls on subjects from agricultural chemicals and genetic engineering to fracking erode the ability of disinterested observers — the public — to judge what is true and what is not with respect to complex public policy issues.And it is distressing for those of us being attacked, to say nothing of our friends and families.As the fellow said in the Mark Twain story, after being tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail, ""If it weren't for the honor, I'd just as soon have walked.""However, history is on the side of scientists, science communicators and journalists who tell the truth. In the words of philosophy professor Crispin Sartwell in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, ""The power of the Russian intelligence services ... is considerable, but it does not include the ability to bend the fabric of reality.""On the other hand, even if we're not found floating face-down in the Volga, it's no fun being among the Google Dead.RELATED:Part 1: Russia Does Far Worse Than Meddle In Our Elections — It Meddles In Our Science

1385,A,"The Supreme Court is especially admirable when correcting especially deplorable prior decisions, as with the 1954 school desegregation decision rejecting a 1896 decision's ""separate but equal"" doctrine. It did so again last Wednesday, overturning a 41-year-old precedent inimical to the First Amendment.Shortly before the court made this predictable ruling, a Wall Street Journal headline revealed why it was necessary. The headline said: ""Unions Court Own Members Ahead of Ruling."" Anticipating defeat, government-employee unions had begun resorting to persuasion — imagine that — in the hope of retaining members and convincing nonmembers to continue making payments to the unions that the court says can no longer be obligatory.In 1977, the court upheld, 6-3, the constitutionality of compelling government employees who exercise their right not to join a union to pay ""fair share"" or ""agency"" fees. These, which the union determines, supposedly cover only the costs of collective bargaining from which nonmembers benefit. But the payments usually are much more than half of, and sometimes equal to, dues that members pay.The majority opinion in 1977 admitted something that was too obvious to deny and so constitutionality problematic that a future challenge was inevitable. That majority said: ""There can be no quarrel with the truism that, because public employee unions attempt to influence government policymaking, their activities ... may be properly termed political."" And one justice, concurring with the majority, said ""the ultimate objective of a union in the public sector, like that of a political party, is to influence public decision-making."" (Emphasis added.)Actually, everything public-sector unions do is political. Therefore, the 1977 decision made compulsory political contributions constitutional. Which made the court queasy.By 2014, it was affirming the principle that doomed the 1977 decision and foretold Wednesday's: It is a ""bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support."" Which is what the court now says regarding compulsory financial support of government-employee unions. Yet Justice Elena Kagan, in her uncharacteristically strident dissent, said:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""There is no sugarcoating today's opinion. The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this nation's law — and in its economic life — for over 40 years. As a result, it prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance. And it does so by weaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.""How does Kagan err? Let us count the ways.The 1977 decision was no more entrenched than the 1896 ""separate but equal"" decision was for 58 years. The First Amendment exists to prevent the people's representatives from making certain kinds of choices (""Congress shall make no law ... ""). Wednesday's decision was not about ""workplace governance"" or ""economic and regulatory policy."" It was about coerced speech. And about denial of another First Amendment guarantee, freedom of association, which includes the freedom not to associate, through coerced financial support, with uncongenial political organizations. And judges are supposed to be unleashed to wield the First Amendment as a weapon against officials perpetrating such abuses.Wednesday's 5-4 decision accords with President Franklin Roosevelt's judgment that ""the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service."" In private-sector bargaining, unions contest management concerning the distribution of companies' profits. In the public sector, government gets its revenues from a third party — taxpayers. Because a majority of organized labor's members are government employees, the labor movement is mostly not horny-handed sons of toil. It increasingly is government organized as an interest group that pressures government to do what it has a metabolic urge to do anyway: grow.The deadliest dagger in Wednesday's decision was the stipulation that nonmembers' fees cannot be automatically deducted from their wages — nonmembers must affirmatively consent to deductions. So, public-sector unions must persuade people. No wonder they are panicking.There is no sugarcoating today's reality. Public-sector unions are conveyor belts that move a portion of government employees' salaries — some of the amount paid in union dues — into political campaigns, almost always Democrats', to elect the people with whom the unions ""negotiate"" for taxpayers' money. Progressives who are theatrically distraught about there being ""too much money in politics"" are now theatrically distraught that the court has ended coercing contributions that have flowed to progressive candidates.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:After A String Of Huge Supreme Court Wins, Will Never-Trumpers Admit They Were Wrong?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1386,A,"There's an options trade that promises stellar returns if U.S. stocks continue to tread water. The catch: It's only managed to deliver that a handful of times over the past decade.Welcome to the forgotten world of buy-writes: an investing style for traders who lack conviction on whether the second-longest bull market on record still has life. It combines long equity exposures with sales of call options to deliver potentially double-digit returns in the event that index moves are subdued.With the main U.S. stock benchmark churning near the midpoint of its trading range, now could be the strategy's moment in the sun. The Cboe S&P 500 BuyWrite Index is besting the equity gauge this year on a price basis, putting it on track for only its third year of outperformance over the past 10.""The investor who is most interested in this fund is someone who thinks the market is going to chop around, go sideways, maybe see a slight pullback,"" said Ted Samulowitz, manager for the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ETF (PBP) at Invesco Advisers.Here's how it works: A portfolio of stocks is acquired, and call options are written on some or all of the shares. The fund earns income from selling the calls, in exchange for giving up the appreciation beyond the exercise price of the options. In other words, if stocks soar, holders won't participate in much, if any, of the gains.It's an investing style recommended by UBS Group, which points out that money managers can trade ""exposure to significant potential upside in equity markets for a smaller, but certain, extra return,"" according to a recent note.While U.S.-listed passive products tracking the strategy have only seen tepid inflows at best so far this year, it offers a juicy income stream that can cushion against moderate market dips, proponents say.The biggest ETF of its kind, the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio, collects around 125 basis points a month from selling options, according to Samulowitz. That's up from around 80 basis points a month at the end of last year, he said, as the trade has the somewhat paradoxical quality of benefiting from moderate bouts of volatility.""It's just another nice thing about a buy-write strategy because as volatility goes up, we collect more premium,"" said Samulowitz.The Cboe BuyWrite Index trailed the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points last year on a price basis, while the gap was 2.5 percentage points in 2016. But in down years for stocks, buy-writes can outperform, outpacing the return of the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points in 2015. While the strategy is neck-and-neck with the S&P this year on a total return basis, it can be adjusted to allow for more or less participation in the market's upside.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe AdvisorShares STAR Global Buy-Write ETF (VEGA), for instance, can sell out-of-the-money calls, which allows it to benefit to a certain extent from rising stocks, according to Rebecca Valdez, fund manager at Partnervest Advisory Services, which manages the ETF.There's an argument that investors who seek yield and don't see much upside in stocks should put their money into bonds, but Samulowitz considers buy-write strategies as a substitute for high-yield debt in a portfolio.""If credit spreads start to widen out, the equity cycle is probably not going to roll over for another six months, so the buy-write should continue to outperform,"" said Samulowitz.While the trade can protect against moderate volatility, it isn't a panacea should another massive spike come along, according to Valdez. The Cboe index fell more than the S&P 500 when volatility more than doubled in early February amid a perfect storm of overextended positions and monetary fears.""You can't negate all of the volatility with a buy-write strategy, but you can definitely dampen it,"" said Valdez.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:6 Ideas To Consider If The Stock Market Is Making You NervousExtreme Market Moves Taking Hold As Italian Bonds Test ModelsNew Leaders Emerge Among Market-Beating Foreign Stock Plays

1387,A,"Climate Change: For more than a decade, California has won high praise from environmentalists for its stringent greenhouse gas restrictions. But a new report shows that despite the enormous costs of this effort, the state is doing a worse job at cutting CO2 emissions than the rest of the country, while badly hurting its working families.Back in 2007, California became the first state to cap CO2 emissions when then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB32, which mandated the state cut greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020. Schwarzenegger called it ""a bold new era of environmental protection.""Not to be outdone, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill last year requiring the state to cut emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.So, what happened? From 2007 to 2015, California managed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 9%. But the rest of the country cut them by more than 10%, according to a new report from the Center for Demographics and Policy at Chapman University in Orange, California.On a per capita basis, 41 states outperformed California on CO2 cuts over those same years.Here's another way to look at it. Ohio, Georgia, Indiana, and Pennsylvania have about the same combined population as California. But these states saw emission reductions five times as great as California. (To be fair, California started from a lower base.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEven that is exaggerating California's achievement. The study notes that because the state has become so inhospitable to manufacturing and energy production, it now imports more energy than any other state in the nation and relies heavily on imported goods.In fact, California imports 66% of its crude oil, 91% of its natural gas, and 88% of the ethanol is uses from other states and countries. California alone accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. oil imports from the Persian Gulf and from Saudi Arabia.Meanwhile, in 2015, it imported about $408 billion in products from other nations, or 16% of the state's GDP.In other words, California is exporting its energy production and manufacturing base to other, more carbon-intensive states and countries, while patting itself on the back for its own CO2 reductions.Even if California were able to meet its ambitious CO2 cuts, it would have no impact on global temperatures — assuming the climate scientists are right in their predictions — because the state represents a tiny portion of global CO2 emissions.And what have Californians received in return for their state's ""bold"" effort? As the report notes, these environmentalist policies have ""significantly distorted the California economy."" And not in a good way.Outside Silicon Valley, this unilateral effort to cut CO2 emissions is hampering the states' economy, eliminating opportunities for working families, and increasing poverty. Housing and energy prices are climbing faster than the national average. Wages for Latinos, African Americans and the less educated have stagnated.""In summary,"" the report says, ""the imposition by the state's Democratic Party leaders of highly regressive climate schemes have engendered disparate financial hardships on middle and lower income workers and minority communities, while providing direct economic subsidies to wealthier Californians in environmentalist strongholds like Marin County.""""This represents a significant departure from more traditional Democratic Party values.""No kidding.This is the problem with environmentalist mandates generally. They make rich coastal elites feel better about themselves, do little to improve the environment, and load all the costs and burdens on the backs of those who can least afford it.Tell us again which political party is the one that cares about working families?Don't Tell Anyone, But We Just Had Two Years Of Record-Breaking Global CoolingClimate-Change True Believers Least Likely To Change Their Own BehaviorCarbon Tax: A Bad Idea Whose Time Should Never Come

1396,A,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs.

1398,A,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs.

1403,A,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss.

1405,A,"The bulk of the stock market's U.S. energy buzz is coming from shale oil producers in Texas and refiners arrayed along the Gulf Coast. But the shale gas fields in the Northeast continue to quietly fuel a boom in petrochemical production and drive down energy costs for a broad range of manufacturers.UGI (UGI) is a natural gas distributor, which also owns a controlling share of AmeriGas Partners (APU) — the largest U.S. marketer and distributor of liquid propane gas. UGI International is an LPG distribution business operating across 17 countries in the U.K. and Europe.The stock's dividend currently yields about 2%. Shares for the past week have been dodging above and below a 52.10 buy point in weak trade. A volume boost could kick in, and the breakout could turn decisive. On the other hand, the stock could continue to hem and haw, and go nowhere.The stock's yearlong consolidation is a saucer base, according to CAN SLIM rules. A decisive move above the base's left-side-high buy point could free up the stock for a significant jump higher. That scenario gets some support from the stock's up/down volume ratio which, at 1.4, suggests upward pressure in shares. Its relative strength line is rising, which also is a bullish sign.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlthough consolidating for the past year, UGI has had some periods of strong stock-price growth. Shares climbed 279% from the start of 1999 through August 2005. At the start of 2012 the stock launched a rally that carried it 165% higher through May 2017.The rise in energy prices and some quiet, fundamental factors turning favorable suggest the almost 140 year-old company may be worth keeping an eye on.UGI is based in King of Prussia, Pa., just northwest of Philadelphia. The company's international and utility segments are its moneymakers. They together account for about 43% of total revenue, and more than 64% of net income. AmeriGas, by comparison, brings in 40% of total revenue, while generating only about 10% of net income.The company's smaller, midstream and marketing unit is the segment in which potential value is unfolding. Under the name Energy Services, the unit last year launched the 35-mile long, 20-inch in diameter Sunbury Pipeline. The line delivers low cost natural gas from the Marcellus Shale fields to a gas-fired power plant in Snyder County, Pa.Also in 2017, Energy Services christened a liquefied natural gas production and storage facility in Meshoppen, Pa. In November, Energy Services commissioned a plant in Steelton, Pa. The peak-shaving facility is designed to temporarily expand capacity of local gas distribution systems by feeding additional supplies during peak use periods. The Steelton facility is also set to include 2 million gallons of LNG storage.The combined additions, as well as recent gains in energy prices, helped to boost UGI's earnings and revenue outlook for the fiscal year, which ends in September. Analyst consensus forecasts 21% gains in both earnings and revenue for the year. That would mark the company's best year in both regards since 2005.One of the biggest marks against the stock is debt. Total long-term debt across UGI's four business segments is more than $4.5 billion. That puts its debt-to-equity ratio around 126%. That is not outlandish, but still above par, compared to its refining and marketing peers. AmeriGas is easily the largest piece of that picture. With debt of more than $2.57 billion, AmeriGas' debt-to-equity tops 340%.Another question is UGI's profitable international stance. While the company's U.S. segment reports purchasing LPG gas from 20 different suppliers, its profitable European arm relies on two suppliers. A European Union looking to inflict pain in regions where support of a tariff-wielding White House could potentially be vulnerable might have an eye on U.S. companies located in states such as Pennsylvania.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED: Iran, Libya, China Fuel Biggest Rise In Oil Prices Since 2016Trump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersIncome Investor News, Best Stocks To Watch

Consensus Metrix sees same-store sales falling 5.7% systemwide, with food and beverage down 7.7%, and amusement and other down 4.6%.Results: EPS of $1.04 on revenue of  $332.2 million, with same-store sales down 4.9%.Outlook: Management backed full-year revenue guidance of  $1.2 billion-$1.24 billion, with the midpoint in line with consensus for $1.23 billion, on a same-store sales gain in the low-to-mid single digits.""We opened six stores during the quarter, our fastest pace so far, and these openings include a few that have delivered some of the highest volume openings in our history,"" said CEO Steve King in a statement. ""The 2017 class of stores is also performing well for us, on track to achieve strong first year returns in line with our recent classes of stores.""Meanwhile, the company also announced that King will retire as CEO on Aug. 5 but will remain on the board as chairman.

1416,A,"Republicans are right to call for tough measures to deter illegal immigration — which means building the wall, ending the ""catch and release"" policy and challenging the harboring strategies of sanctuary cities.But where Republicans are wrong is in calling for strict caps and even reductions in legal immigration visas. Rather than be restricted, the so-called H-1B program, which brings skilled workers to our country, should be expanded.Almost every economic analysis finds that legal immigrants, on balance, are net contributors to the American economy.Not all immigrants are beneficial, and, sure, there are bad apples in the bunch — just as is true of the population of American citizens as a whole. But the benefits of immigration are surprisingly large, mostly because most immigrants are risk takers who come to the United States between the ages of 16 and 40 — so they tend to be at the start of their working years or at the peak of their earning years.We also know that the more skilled the immigrants, the larger their contribution to overall productivity and the bigger their lifetime net tax payments — i.e., the more they reduce budget deficits.The prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is a positive economic effect of immigration. Its 2016 study explained that immigrant workers may be ""complementary with natives, especially high-skilled natives ... with high-skilled immigrants innovating sufficiently to raise the productivity of all workers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBecause most immigrants arrive when they are young, and because Americans are getting older (baby boomers are at retirement age), immigration could help fill our labor force needs. This is especially important now, because U.S. birth rates just hit a 30-year low. Without immigration, we would have negative population growth, and we'd soon look like aging Japan. Immigration is America's fountain of youth.So if the GOP wants to be a growth party, it must be a pro-immigration party. Period.Fortunately, there is an easy way to increase the visas for skilled immigrants. First, to forestall the ""graying of America,"" we should increase the overall number of legal immigrants from about 1 million per year to about 1.5 million per year.Second, we should shift the composition of immigrants by using a merit-based policy, along the lines of what Trump has endorsed and what has been adopted in Canada, Australia and Germany. Immediate family members, children and spouses would still go to the front of the line.Others should be selected on the basis of their skills, talents and brains. Some worry that programs such as the H-1B visa program, which allows employers to sponsor and hire immigrants with specific needed skills, cost Americans jobs. But a 2014 study by the Partnership for a New American Economy found that these skilled immigrants have raised wages for American works and increased job growth in science, engineering, and technology fields. ""High-skilled immigrants don't displace U.S.-born workers in computer fields,"" the study found.These positive effects are more pronounced when the labor market is tight — as it is now. The unemployment rate of those with at least a bachelor's degree in a computer, math or science field is only 2% today. For those who have a degree in architecture or engineering, the jobless rate was a microscopic 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018.Donald Trump rightly aims to achieve a sustained 3% to 4% annual growth rate for America. This faster growth will require more immigrants, and no nation has a better opportunity than America to import the brains and talents and risk takers from the rest of the world.

1419,A,"Environment: It has become an article of faith in the U.S. that recycling is a good thing. But evidence is piling up that recycling is a waste of time and money, and a bit of a fraud.The New York Times recently reported that, unknown to most families who spend hours separating garbage into little recycling bins, much of the stuff ends up in a landfill anyway.One big reason: China has essentially shut the door to U.S. recyclables.The Times notes that about a third of recyclables gets shipped abroad, with China the biggest importer. But starting this year, China imposed strict rules on what it will accept, effectively banning most of it. That, the Times reports, has forced many recycling companies who can't find other takers to dump recyclables into landfills.One company, Oregon's Rogue Disposal and Recycling, sent ""all its recycling to landfills for the first few months of the year,"" the Times reports.Bloomberg says Massachusetts has issued dozens of landfill waivers so recyclable material can be dumped in them. The Florida Sun Sentinel reports that in Broward County, Fla., up to 30% of the stuff residents put in recycling bins ends up in landfills.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWorse, some local officials aren't telling residents this for fear that they will give up on recycling altogether.Even without China's recycling wall, plenty of ""recyclables"" end up in landfills, in part because of ""single stream"" recycling. That's where residents can put everything in the same bin — a switch designed to encourage more recycling. But it results in more stuff that can't be recycled because it's ""contaminated."" One study found that about 30% of plastic collected in these ""single stream"" bins can't be recycled.In addition, the market for recyclable materials has collapsed as supply increases and demand subsides. Manufacturers use less material, recycled or otherwise, to make things like bottles and cans. And lower oil prices make it more economical to make products fresh, rather than from scraps.As a result, prices for paper, plastic, glass and scrap aluminum have plunged. In some cases to zero.But this isn't even the worst of it. As John Tierney explained in an exhaustive analysis of recycling programs, also published by the New York Times, recycling is not only costly, but doesn't do much to help the environment.The claim that recycling is essential to avoid running out of landfill space is hogwash, since all the stuff Americans throw away for the next 1,000 years would fit into ""one-tenth of 1% of land available for grazing,"" Tierney says.Other environmental benefits, he finds, are negligible, and come at an exceedingly high price. Tierney notes, for example, that washing plastics before recycling them, as is the recommended practice, could end up adding to greenhouse gas emissions. And the extra trucks and processing facilities produce CO2 as well.Since it costs far more to recycle trash than to bury it, governments are wasting money that could be more effectively spent elsewhere.Good luck convincing people of any of this. Recycling is the new religion. And as Tierney put it, ""religious rituals don't need any practical justification.""True enough. But then again, recyclers have no business enforcing their beliefs on others, either.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Tell Anyone, But We Just Had Two Years Of Record-Breaking Global CoolingDemocrats Blast Trump For High Gas Prices … After They Spent Years Trying To Force Them UpA Rebirth Of Self-Reliance?

1422,A,"Oil prices and stocks, led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and California Resources (CRC), surged after OPEC agreed to increase production next month, though the vagueness of the deal underscored the fissures in the oil group.XOPEC producers and allies like Russia will aim to increase output by about 1 million barrels per day, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters, though the actual increase is likely to be smaller as countries like Venezuela struggle to ramp up. S&P Global Platts expects a net output increase of around 700,000 bpd, largely met by Saudi Arabia.But OPEC's official statement on the decision didn't provide a specific number for the production increase. Instead, the statement said producers will more closely adhere to an earlier deal to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day. Since that deal was struck in 2016, participants have substantially overshot that target, with the reduction estimated at 2.8 million bpd.Despite the mixed signals coming from OPEC, the highly awaited policy decision Friday is bullish for oil prices as the planned output boost will bring markets closer to balance, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.But he also found the contentious run-up to Friday's decision telling, as Iran had threatened to veto proposals to boost output.""OPEC is not the unified group it once was, they are all different interests and different capabilities,"" said Youngberg, who sees the introduction of electric vehicles and rise in U.S. shale production further crimping OPEC's leadership in the years ahead.He added that politics are more of an issue within OPEC now, with Russia playing both sides of the Iran-Saudi Arabia geopolitical rivalry.Last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, notably began looking at forging their own, separate agreement on energy cooperation.U.S. crude oil prices jumped 4.6% to settle at $68.58 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 3.4% to $75.55 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell spiked 4.4% on the stock market today. Marathon Oil leapt 8%, and shale producer California Resources soared 10%. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) gained 2%, and BP (BP) surged 3.7%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOther details from Friday's agreement were left vague, such as how the increase will affect member countries at the individual level, focusing instead on a collective target.""It's an elegant solution to the problem they have had, where some countries have not been able to increase and some have lost production,"" said Roger Diwan, energy analyst at IHS Markit. ""They don't have to renegotiate quotas,"" bypassing a thorny issue and avoiding antagonizing OPEC members who can't produce, he added.What OPEC achieved, he added, ""is trying to keep (Brent crude) prices in a narrow range and not to cross $80+.""Ahead of OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Friday, divisions within the oil cartel threw the outcome into uncertainty up to the last minute.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia sought to boost output again. But Iran was stubbornly opposed to a boost, as renewed U.S. sanctions would prevent it from selling more oil anyway. Other OPEC members like Venezuela and Iraq also signaled they weren't on board with an increase.OPEC was able to overcome objections by Iran and others to production increases by framing their decision as a return to the originally agreed 1.8 million bpd cuts, S&P Global Platts noted.""The fact that we dealt with overcompliance (on cutback commitments) that was worrying the industry … this is what made the deliberations meaningful,"" OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei of the United Arab Emirates said in a press conference Friday.On Saturday, OPEC and its non-member partners will hold another meeting to ratify today's agreement.Meanwhile, the OPEC decision is unlikely to drive any strategic shift from American shale companies in the near term, Youngberg said.In the past year, many companies have promised to prioritize spending discipline over production expansion after previously rushing to pump more oil when prices recovered.""Shale plays are focused really on living within their cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders,"" reflected in their debt reduction, dividends and buybacks, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

1423,A,"Rank and file government workers won big over union bosses Wednesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Mark Janus, an Illinois state worker who refused to join the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. The court struck down an Illinois law that allowed the union to deduct fees from Janus's paycheck despite his refusal to join.The Janus ruling smashes laws in 22 states — including New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and California — that compel nonmembers to support unions. Until now, if you wanted a government job in these states, you had to pay up. But now firefighters, teachers and other public employees won't have to fork over a penny to a union if they choose not to join. For the average worker who opts out, it will mean hundreds of dollars more in take-home pay a year.More in workers' pockets, less in union coffers. Nationwide, unions are expected to forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars when nonmembers stop paying and some members quit to save money, too.When unions lose, so do politicians — primarily Democrats — who feed at their table. The Democratic Party counts on unions to tilt elections with hefty donations and manpower to get out the vote. Unions are the Democratic Party's ATM. The Janus ruling, by reducing that money source, levels the political playing field.One Republican is already a winner — President Donald Trump — for delivering on his promise of a conservative court. In a 2016 Supreme Court case over union fees, the Justices split 4-4, leaving mandatory fees in place. This time Trump's Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, cast the tie-breaking vote.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBefore the ruling, nonmembers could in theory request a refund of any fees unions admitted spending on politics. But unions insisted little of it was spent that way. Janus argued that everything a government union like AFSCME does is political. Janus blamed AFSCME for the costly labor contracts and huge public budgets that Illinois taxpayers had to pay for. The Justices decided that compelling Janus to support the union violates his constitutional rights under the First Amendment.Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, discarded a 1977 precedent and went straight to the founders. Quoting Jefferson, Alito said ""to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.""Unions are apoplectic. The National Education Association plans to slash its budget, fearing that 300,000 members will quit.Union bosses and their political allies aren't taking the ruling lying down. Governor Andrew Cuomo's been touting his ""anti-Janus"" legislation, designed to make it nearly impossible for workers to opt out of unions.New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy also signed an end-run around Janus. It shrinks the opt-out window to a mere 10 days each year.New Jersey's anti-Janus law also requires new hires to sit through a mandatory 30-minute lecture on the benefits of union membership. Employers are barred from presenting the other side. In America? Is this crazy or what?These laws, which show disdain for working people, are dead in the water. The justices anticipated such shenanigans. The ruling specified that union fees cannot be extracted from a nonmember unless ""the employee affirmatively consents to pay."" Unions will have to convince nonmembers to opt in. Forget about opt out.Politicians who pushed anti-Janus provisions are the same ones who support lavish union contracts and work rules that explode the cost of public services.In Connecticut, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Joe Aresimowicz, sets the rules for union negotiations. Unbelievably, he's a member of AFSCME himself. Thanks to this cronyism, Connecticut has the second-highest state and local tax burden in the nation after — you guessed it — New York.The shameful politicians who plotted to weasel around the Janus ruling were blocked Wednesday. Janus will have impact. Workers can choose to support a union or spend their pay in other ways. With union political clout diminished, John Q. Taxpayer's views will count for more. It's a promising first step toward lowering the cost of government.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:After A String Of Huge Supreme Court Wins, Will Never-Trumpers Admit They Were Wrong?

1426,A,"Financial Crisis: U.S. markets have been roiled in recent days by political and economic turmoil in Italy. Is it an overreaction? Not at all. Markets are right to be worried.Much of the U.S. has been fixated on President Trump's on-again, off-again decision to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. But Italy's crisis, now at a rolling boil in the background, has spooked the markets too.Markets plunged Tuesday, before rebounding on Wednesday. That should be a warning.Italy has had a rough two decades, but is now undergoing dangerous political turbulence that risks Italy's social and political stability, and could lead to the collapse of the European Union as we know it. That would not be good for the U.S., or any other nation for that matter.How did this happen? A parliamentary election in March handed a clear popular mandate to the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and the right-of-center Lega, or ""League,"" to form a government.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the current president, Sergio Matarella, vetoed the idea. He didn't like their policies, and especially didn't like their nominee for finance minister, Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and leading Italian euro-skeptic. Italy's constitution gives the president the right to veto ministerial nominees.The Italian establishment is truly alarmed that the two parties said they'll seek to undo the previous government's economic reforms, which have kept Italy firmly anchored to the EU. The two parties also vow to pursue a grab bag of other populist economic policies, including a guaranteed basic income and a flat income tax, that terrify establishment politicians.As a result, Italy will likely call for a new parliamentary election in the fall, with a lot of market chaos until then.The problem is, the parties in question aren't going quietly. They were enraged after the EU appeared to intervene in Italy's affairs, with EU Budget Minister Otto Oettinger retweeting an earlier comment: ""The markets will teach Italy to vote for the right thing.""Jokes abound about Italy's fractious politics, for good reason. Since 1946, Italy has had 64 governments. And no, that's not a misprint. But, economically speaking, is Italy really that important?""The country has the world's third largest sovereign debt market, after the U.S. and Japan, with total public debt of more than $2.5 trillion,"" wrote Desmond Lachmann, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former IMF official, this week. ""A default, as would almost certainly happen were the Italian government's borrowing costs to increase on leaving the euro, would almost certainly spark a European banking crisis that would reach the U.S.""So the answer is yes.Italy's economic struggle has been serious and protracted. Its per capita income is actually lower today than it was when it entered the eurozone in 1999, even as the world economy has expanded strongly. Its debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at 133%. Among all EU nations, only Greece's debt ratio is higher.Meanwhile, Italy's banking system stands on shaky legs, with 15% of all loans outstanding classified as nonperforming. With virtually no economic growth and a financial system on the verge of collapse, Italy is in deep trouble.If the EU's economy freezes up because of Italy's political turmoil, we'll feel it here. U.S. exports will decline, tourism will plunge, currencies will make volatile moves, and currency flows will be large and unpredictable. The U.S. may benefit from this in the short run, but not for long.While our markets digest this bad news, the Fed may rethink raising interest rates four times this year. Fed futures contracts show a drop in the probability of four rate hikes this year from about 45% to below 15% on Wednesday.This should serve as a reminder that many of the troubled and dysfunctional European Union's members are effectively fiscally insolvent. That includes Italy. They've benefited greatly from the era of zero and negative interest rates, but now rising rates threaten that. As rates rise, country after country will experience pain.Until the EU sorts out its bad finances, the U.S. will be in danger from its financial difficulties. We saw that in 2010 on a smaller scale with Greece, which is only one-tenth the size of Italy.Maybe the EU's unelected policymakers should stop their gratuitous insults of President Trump and focus on their own incompetent stewardship instead. Italy is big enough to bring the whole house down.As for the U.S., our policymakers should do nothing to make the EU's plight worse. It will only come back to hurt us.The bigger lesson is, we weathered Greece's crisis, but may not be so lucky this time. Maybe we should start cleaning our own fiscal house, too.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:European Union Takes Another Step Closer To CollapseFear-Driven European Union Rate Cut Won't Bring Back GrowthClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1429,A,"The China trade war is officially underway, and President Donald Trump already is looking ahead to escalating the conflict. Just after midnight on Friday, Trump tariffs of 25% on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports took effect. Beijing vowed to fire back immediately, aiming at U.S. autos and agriculture. But stock futures took the actual start of hostilities in stride.American-built vehicles from the likes of Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and even Daimler (DDAIF), which builds Mercedes-Benz SUVs in Alabama, will face an additional 25% tax. China also is targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports.The Trump administration has already drawn up the next phases of the war and it could get ugly. But President Trump and President Xi Jinping may still have one last chance to call a cease-fire, either later this month or in August.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday after the stock market had closed, Trump confirmed Friday's China tariffs, and tallied up what's on the trade war launching pad: ""34, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStock market futures' reaction was muted. Dow futures, which initially traded modestly higher, fell 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures lost 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell a fraction. In Thursday's stock market trading, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1%, the S&P 500 index 0.9% and the Dow Jones 0.75%. But the stock market rally has come under pressure as Trump trade war fears have intensified.The U.S. only imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, but you get the point: Trump is clearly threatening a full-scale China trade war. Beijing, meanwhile, vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow. While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Some analysts also think the Trump tariffs may have played a role in last week's patent infringement Chinese court ruling against Micron Technology (MU).Now that Trump and Xi are beyond the brink of a trade war, the big question is what, if anything, can bring them back.There's one clear answer. Trump has already bent over backwards to save Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE and its 70,000 jobs. But the rescue job isn't quite over. The Commerce Department still have to give a green light to U.S. component suppliers to resume sales to ZTE. In addition, Congress must reject a Senate amendment to a must-pass defense funding bill that would keep a ban on sales to ZTE. Both of those developments should fall into place by August.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress. That's why there is a real risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But the ZTE reprieve may give Xi an occasion to resume negotiations despite the live fire. After all, those talks only made progress after Trump intervened, pledging to get ZTE back in business quickly.For a brief moment, Trump touted a deal that would have China buy more from American farmers, instead of cutting purchases of soybeans, cotton and other crops. We'll know later this summer if there's still such a deal to be had.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThe Big Picture: Stocks Rally On Eve Of U.S.-China Trade War6 Stocks To Watch As Trade Tariffs Near DeadlineThese 5 Top Stocks Are Near Buy Points From This Bullish Base

Fed policymakers have tried to assuage fears that they'll overreact to a modest inflation pickup. Fed participants' projections in March showed that a slim majority expected three rate hikes, not four, in 2018. A firmer inflation reading this month, coming after the jobless rate fell to 3.8%, might shift expectations toward four hikes, which could cause yet another negative market reaction.The Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.

1441,A,"A problem in Rolls-Royce jet engines that earlier grounded certain Boeing (BA) Dreamliner jets has been found in a different engine model, forcing a new round of inspections.XThe British industrial conglomerate, a jet-engine rival to General Electric (GE) and United Technologies (UTX), had already been grappling with a compressor flaw in its Trent 1000 Package C engines. That earlier problem grounded Boeing 787s while they were being checked.Rolls-Royce has now discovered a similar compressor problem in ""a small number"" of Trent 1000 Package B engines and will inspect 166 Package B jet engines currently in service.Shares of Boeing rose 0.4% at 370.94 on the stock market today, while Airbus edged up 0.1% at 29.77.

But the $5.1 billion fund is heavily concentrated on the largest 10 holdings, which account for 63% of the fund's weighting.Some 38% of the portfolio is in integrated oil companies, a group that includes industry giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) is similar to the Vanguard fund in that it is heavily weighted on its largest holdings. The top 10 account for 63% of the total weighting. That leaves only a small influence in the rest of the 135 holdings in the ETF.Nearly 83% of the $649.5 million fund is invested in big-cap companies.The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (IEO) ETF has more of a focus on the search and extraction part of the oil business. With 67 holdings, the ETF has put 73% of funds in exploration and production companies. More than 23% of the portfolio is in refinery and marketing.The $514.7 million ETF is the only one among the five that does not own heavyweights Exxon Mobil and Chevron.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX (FXN), an ETF that was discussed in last week's column, holds a portfolio of nearly 50 stocks in oilfield services, refinery, production, drilling and related companies.The other four ETFs are predominantly big-cap funds. But a median market cap of $11.9 million gives the First Trust Energy portfolio a smaller average size.

The stock has formed an 118.58 handle. The handle isn't visible on a weekly chart, which isn't ideal. But the handle shows up clearly on a daily. It's 7 days long so far with the pullback moderate but clear.Broadcom is working on a 273.95 double-bottom base. The wireless chipmaker has rallied since early May, closing Friday at 270.23. The stock hit resistance around this area a couple of times earlier this year.Broadcom stock has been consolidating since late November. Shares came under pressure as the chipmaker made a big bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Even after President Trump blocked a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal on national security grounds, the stock continued to struggle as Broadcom warned of weak smartphone demand.

1451,A,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) continued to show strong earnings in Q2 and laid out steps to offset higher fuel costs, leaving analysts wondering why the stock doesn't reflect all that seems to be going right at the airline.XOn a conference call Thursday, Delta executives were asked different versions of the same question: What can it do to get investors to actually like it?JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker prefaced a question by noting the airline industry's merger wave in years past that kept it from imploding, and the sense that things for Delta and others are ""different this time.""""But the economy is roaring,"" he said. ""Your stock's down 10% year to date. You're trading at a multiple that's no better than when the industry was basically a joke. You're essentially getting zero credit for what you've accomplished. ... So my question is: What is still broken here?""In response, to him and others, management stressed that it was succeeding in countering the swelling fuel costs that have gutted airline stocks this year. CEO Ed Bastian said margin expansion would be important to appeasing the Street. The company said its plans to trim its fall flight schedule have set the stage to accomplish that goal by the end of the year. Management also said it would continue to shuffle flight schedules in areas where they can't pass on fuel costs to passengers.What's more, corporate-travel revenue rose 10% during the quarter. As President Trump doubles down on complaints over international trade, Bastian said the carrier was ""not seeing any signs that the rumored escalating trade wars"" were hurting travel, business or otherwise. Delta Air Lines on Thursday also hiked its dividend by 15% to 35 cents a share.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 1.8% on the stock market today, though they are still below their 50- and 200-day averages and are 16% 52-week highs. American Airlines (AAL), whose shares sold off 8% on Wednesday, rose 1% Thursday. United Airlines (UAL) picked up 3.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier in the morning, Delta Air Lines slashed its full-year earnings-per-share outlook to $5.35-$5.70 from $6.35-$6.70, citing a $2 billion expected increase in fuel costs. Analysts expected earnings per share of $5.70.Management expects total unit revenue growth of 3.5%-5.5% for Q3. The midpoint of that range would mark a slight slowdown from the 4.6% gain notched in Q2.For Q2, the carrier's EPS rose 11% to $1.77, above Zacks estimates for $1.73. Revenue came in at $11.8 billion, just above forecasts for $11.68 billion. Adjusted fuel costs surged 33% to $578 million.""With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,"" said Bastian said in a statement before the call.Precisely how Delta might rebalance its flight schedule later this year is also not completely clear. The carrier said it is reducing capacity in underperforming markets in Latin America, the region it said faced the most difficulties during the quarter.Elsewhere, international travel remained strong. As negotiations in the U.K. crumble over the terms of its departure from the European Union, Delta said its business traffic to and from the U.K. was at record levels. The outlook for corporate demand remains strong, the carrier said.Higher fuel costs have led analysts to wonder how airlines might adjust flight schedules to shore up sales and profits. Airlines could potentially deploy flights to areas where it's more expensive to fly and pull them back elsewhere. The smaller supply of seats and flights could help airlines raise fares.American Airlines on Wednesday added to those worries. The carrier lowered its Q2 unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power in the U.S., even as strong travel demand and higher oil prices increasingly allow airlines to pass higher costs onto consumers.Some analysts said American would likely also adjust its flight capacity growth plans as the higher fuel costs eat into profits. Southwest (LUV) last month cut its own outlook for full-year capacity growth.Unit revenue, an important efficiency metric that gauges airline revenue as it relates to flight capacity, has generally improved since last year. American's announcement left some analysts wondering if competition from Southwest Airlines (LUV) was to blame, and if American's demand relied on low fares. Others downplayed American Airlines' forecast, saying the downbeat forecast was expected.On Thursday's call, Delta said domestic yields, or its ability to charge passengers more to fly, were weaker than they would like them to be. But a ""flush consumer"" with an appetite for travel experiences helped leisure travel, management said.Delta also said there was room to improve corporate airfare trends in the U.S. The company said that corporate fares have moved up internationally.When asked by a reporter about the point at which higher fares might curtail demand, Bastian would only say that trends were still pretty good.""We're not seeing anything other than strong demand for our product,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Top Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyS&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Airline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

1452,A,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity. Delta could announce its own decision on how many flights it will ultimately offer for the rest of the year when it reports on Thursday.""In a rising jet fuel environment, airlines should be raising prices, and investors expect yields to show improvement to offset higher labor and fuel costs,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""The increase in yields will take time, but investors did not anticipate a reduction, mostly because most airlines have indicated that a lot of the deepest discounted fares have left the system.""She said that even though American has benefited from strong demand, that demand appeared to be the product of low fares. As jet-fuel costs rise and unit revenue flags, American would likely trim its fall and winter flight schedules as well, she said.""Demand remains solid but they need to show they can overcome rising fuel costs with higher fares,"" she said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines To Make This Key Decision Over Next Month As Fuel Hits ProfitTop Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

1459,A,"A day of reckoning is near for Tesla stock, the Model 3 sedan and the company's colorful co-founder and chief executive, Elon Musk.By the end of this month, Tesla (TSLA) plans to finally live up to Musk's repeated vow to crank out 5,000 Model 3s — billed as a sedan for the masses — each week. In the coming quarter, the maker of luxury electric cars aims to make good on Musk's relentless promise to be profitable. And in the process, the company and its CEO hope to reassure investors that Tesla's $10.5 billion debt burden and scorching cash burn will soon be in the rearview mirror.It's heady corporate drama. Will Tesla ultimately become a new-age General Motors (GM), a force majeure in the rising electric-car industry? Or will its far-reaching vision fall short?Musk, a modern-day corporate magnate, is determined to blast skeptical short sellers worried about the Tesla cash burn by mass-producing Model 3s.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWall Street is divided on whether Musk and Tesla can pull it off. Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura and a Tesla stock bull, points out that the company has a two-year backlog of Model 3 orders to help smooth the road ahead.""They don't have an issue with demand,"" said Shah.Still, Tesla short-seller Mark Spiegel, manager at hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Management, said he considers the carmaker to be ""a company so landmine-filled that I think it can implode at any time.""Tesla stock is one of the most shorted issues on Wall Street. Those counting on the Tesla cash burn to help it fail are betting it will miss its production targets for the new Model 3 for the third time, putting the company in a financially risky situation.Short sellers get Musk's dander up. The Tesla chief recently tweeted he would torch them with one of the flamethrowers he had made as a moneymaking promotion for one of his other ventures, the tunnel-digging Boring Co.""Short burn of the century coming soon,"" Musk wrote in a tweet last month. ""Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.""It's unclear, though, just who faces the heat. The Tesla cash burn recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. The usually cheeky Musk has become curt at news conferences. Company goals keep falling by the wayside.Much of it stems from the Model 3. If Tesla can more than double Model 3 output from the prior quarter to 5,000 a week, Musk believes the company can be profitable in the third quarter and avoid having to raise cash. But profitability has continually eluded the company.Musk most recently attacked short sellers on June 17, saying they had about three weeks ""before their short position explodes."" That time frame coincides with the end of the second quarter and would be about the time Tesla typically reports quarterly vehicle deliveries. A number above expectations could send Tesla stock soaring even higher than the more than 20% jump it has seen since hitting a low four weeks ago.Tesla shares were down 0.3%, near 332.70 during Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 386.99 set on Sept. 18.Musk, though, is known for setting ambitious deadlines he often can't meet. The Roadster, the Model S, Model X and the Model 3 were all delayed from his original timeline.Still, his ambitions persist. Musk plans to double Model 3 production again to 10,000 as it adds a third production line at its Fremont, Calif., manufacturing plant — a line that is being built temporarily under a tent.Tesla's long-term Model 3 goal is to ramp up production to 500,000 vehicles per year. That's a huge leap from its 100,000 annual run rate for the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle.Further, Tesla still promises to price the Model 3 at $35,000, a version that has yet to materialize. The Model 3s coming off the line now are loaded with extras and go for roughly $50,000.Another obstacle for Tesla is expanding its massive battery plant in the Nevada desert to supply power for all those cars. The 5.8-million-square-foot plant, called Gigafactory 1, already has cost more than $1 billion.Further, Tesla seeks to add gigafactories in China and Europe. It also will need more retail outlets, service centers and charging stations.All this is going on at the same time Tesla is developing the Model Y, a crossover vehicle, in addition to a big-rig truck called Semi and a new Roadster.Perhaps the biggest albatross hanging around the company's neck, though, is the $10.5 billion in debt that could grow further.""Of course, the debt load concerns me,"" said Brad Erickson, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""But the reality is: With the manufacturing improvements and the plodding toward profitability, the cash burns go down dramatically. If Tesla can make the Model 3 in greater quantity, we believe they will turn gross-margin positive in the third quarter.""The Tesla cash burn will decline dramatically, if not halt, should current Model 3 targets be met, he said. ""So the moment you're not burning cash anymore, that's a moot point,"" Erickson said.When Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on May 2, it showed a cash balance of $2.67 billion. It burned through $1.1 billion in cash during the quarter. It isn't clear how much it's spent in the current quarter.But it will need to spend billions of dollars more as it expands vehicle production and invests in batteries and other infrastructure. Skeptics say that only cash injections from the outside can help.In March, financial pressures and production shortfalls spurred Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Tesla's credit rating to B3, from B2. That's six levels below investment grade.Moody's said Tesla faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and pending debt maturities. Moody's thinks the company needs to raise $2 billion to cover the Tesla cash burn for 2018.Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino said in a report last month that Tesla could need to raise more than $10 billion in capital by 2020 to fund operations and expansion. That includes the cost of a new facility in China that could serve as both a vehicle manufacturing plant and gigafactory.He has a sell rating on Tesla stock with a six-month price target of 195, little more than half of where it currently trades, around 360. Tamberrino is skeptical that Tesla will meet its production goals for the Model 3. He forecasts that the company will run low on cash by year-end.Other Tesla stock skeptics include UBS analyst Colin Langan, who has a sell rating on Tesla stock, also with a price target of 195. Langan, in a research note last month, said he remains cautious on Tesla stock, ""given the cash burn, the volatile and uncertain production timeline, and initial quality concerns."" He also said it's unclear how Tesla can fund its aggressive product plans.Ryan Brinkman at JPMorgan, a Tesla bear, has a price target of 180 and rating of underweight.KeyBanc's Erickson is also critical of Musk for mismanaging expectations and being a poor forecaster of his business. On the other hand, he says, Musk is on a long leash.""Who else can announce an electric car in a webcast and not advertise or say when the car will come and take in nearly a half-billion dollars in deposits?"" said Erickson. He was citing the company's Model 3 debut.Nomura's Shah, perhaps the most bullish analyst for the company on Wall Street, says the Tesla cash burn doesn't worry him. He recently raised his Tesla price target to 450 from 420, with a buy rating. That's roughly a 25% premium from where the stock now trades.Narrowly focusing on Tesla's balance sheet is a backward way of looking at things, he says.""We see them overcoming the production issues and accelerating growth in the back half of this year for Model 3,"" Shah said. ""I expect that in the next three months we'll go from talking about the balance sheet and negative cash flows to market opportunity and market growth.""Shah's confidence in Tesla is due in part to the company's size and fast growth. Revenue rose 68% in 2017 to $11.76 billion from the year-ago period. That comes after 73% growth in the previous year, though Tesla can boast of only two profitable quarters.""It's really unusual to find a company in the multibillion-dollar range growing revenue more than 60% per year,"" Shah said. ""I don't see that slowing down.""The Model 3 comes just as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), BMW, Volkswagen (VLKAY), Toyota Motor (TM) and others threaten its standing among electric-car makers.General Motors previously announced a goal to make 1 million GM electric vehicles a year by 2026. Ford has said it will invest $11 billion in electric-vehicle production.Among the challenges faced by Musk is that he's stretched thin. Musk spends about half his time as chief executive of SpaceX, which is routinely launching satellites.Musk also runs Boring Co., which is more of a side project. It promises to lessen traffic congestion by digging underground tunnels for high-speed transportation. The multiple demands could be among the reasons Musk abruptly cut off analysts halfway through Tesla's first-quarter conference call for posing what he called ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" questions.Despite Tesla's history of burning cash at a rate better-established companies would likely be crucified for, Musk has steadfastly opposed the idea of raising more equity or debt later this year. Tesla says it has significantly cut its projected capital expenditures by focusing on critical near-term needs.The company recently laid off 9% of the Tesla workforce, part of a thorough reorganization announced in May. Musk said the cutbacks would not affect the company's ability to reach Model 3 production targets.Musk expects cash flow from selling Model 3s to the 450,000-plus people who have placed a $1,000 reservation deposit. He says that will help fund several Tesla initiatives. Among them are its gigafactory expansion and a new plant to make the Model Y crossover vehicle.During the recent Tesla annual shareholder meeting, Musk once again reiterated his target of becoming cash-flow positive in the third quarter of this year with the ramped-up production for the Model 3.Tesla could meet its production targets. But it also will have to meet targets for higher gross margins to hit profitability.Several Wall Street analysts consider that unrealistic, given the company's missed production goals and high debt.Then there are the short sellers. Among the most vocal is Stanphyl Capital's Spiegel.""I don't think Musk can make this company profitable, or even save it at this point because of all the debt,"" said Spiegel. ""The company seems to require more than $4 billion a year, and that's without building a second factory to make the Model Y, or a truck.""Spiegel also thinks Tesla is on shaky ground because of the $7,500 federal tax credit that buyers of electric vehicles can receive.That tax credit has limits. It's available to the first 200,000 U.S. Tesla buyers, as is the case with other electric-car manufacturers. Upon meeting the 200,000 threshold, the credit begins to gradually wind down over the next several quarters.Tesla should hit the 200,000 limit this year. That would effectively raise prices for buyers of Tesla vehicles. General Motors is also nearing its limit, but new providers of electric vehicles will have the full $7,500 credit.Yet, as Erickson notes, Musk has come out on top many times.""It would be foolish to count him out at this stage of the game given all that he has been able to accomplish to date,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Three Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals, And These China Stocks Keep TumblingCheck Out Top Stocks Near A Buy Point NowYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeGet All The Latest Tesla News, Stock Chart And More

Micron Technology reports earnings on Wednesday.Micron stock also is the highest rated, with a 98 Composite Rating. Entegris has a 94 Composite Rating, Texas Instruments a 92 CR and ASML a 90 CR. Broadcom stock, which struggled for months amid a failed bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) and weak smartphone demand, has a lowly so-so 69 CR.Chip stocks tend to be a key component of a stock market rally, especially when the Nasdaq composite leads. Some chipmakers have broken out, including Intel (INTC). But in recent weeks retail, software and FANG stocks have led, with software and Chinese livestreaming IPOs soaring.Dow Jones futures slid 0.75% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.8% below fair value. Asian markets generally closed lower in the wake of an escalating U.S.-China trade war. European bourses also retreated.

Shares soared in May, with the memory chip specialist announcing strong earnings guidance early on May 21 and then a big buyback after the close that day.

Micron stock has pulled back, forming a handle and closing Friday 58.23.Micron fell 0.8% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.Micron is expected to report a 93% EPS gain to $3.12 as sales pop 39% to $7.75 billion for fiscal Q2. The company has benefited from strong demand and high prices for memory chips. Some analysts question if those prices can be sustained, so the results and guidance will closely watched.Texas Instruments stock has been consolidating since late January. The stock has formed an 118.58 handle. The handle isn't visible on a weekly chart, which isn't ideal. But the handle shows up clearly on a daily. It's 7 days long so far with the pullback moderate but clear.Broadcom is working on a 273.95 double-bottom base. The wireless chipmaker has rallied since early May, closing Friday at 270.23. The stock hit resistance around this area a couple of times earlier this year.Broadcom stock has been consolidating since late November. Shares came under pressure as the chipmaker made a big bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Even after President Trump blocked a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal on national security grounds, the stock continued to struggle as Broadcom warned of weak smartphone demand.

1468,A,"Despite daunting competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) is making a pretty good case it's one of the best dividend stocks as the retailer trades near highs.A steady track record of payouts gives Target an annualized dividend growth rate of 20%.Shares have recovered nicely after the stock fell hard last month.

The $550 million deal was done to better compete with Walmart and Amazon.com.As a result of the deal, Target launched same-day delivery from more than 700 stores. A few months earlier, Target acquired San Francisco-based transportation technology company Grand Junction.No doubt Target has been spending money to make money, and the investments seems to be paying off.Quarterly after-tax margin has improved for two quarters in a row, from 3.3% to 4.2%.

1470,A,"This week, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., issued a clarion call to Democrats outraged at the policies of the Trump administration: It's time for mob action.In the wake of mobs targeting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Waters explained: ""God is on our side! On the side of the children ... Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""Waters has always been a fan of mob action. She infamously touted the violent and brutal 1992 Los Angeles riots, which did approximately $1 billion in property damage and ended with 63 people dead. Waters called the events a ""rebellion,"" labeling them a ""spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice and a lot of alienation and frustration."" And yet Waters has been affectionately nicknamed ""Auntie Maxine"" thanks to her rabid attacks against the Trump administration.Democratic leaders ranging from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced Waters' words. They've done the same with regard to violent protests on college campuses. That is meritorious and deserves praise.But there is little question that major political figures on both sides of the aisle have played footsie with mob action to little or no blowback.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's not just Waters. President Obama made excuses for riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, during his presidency; Rev. Al Sharpton, who has actually been involved in precipitating mob violence, still gets to play peacemaker on national television; during President Trump's 2016 campaign, he repeatedly referenced the possibility of violence against protesters.No civil society can humor such overtures to mob action and remain civil for long. The First Amendment protects Maxine Waters, of course, and it should. But Americans should be appalled by her words, rather than slightly titillated by them. And yet it seems that extreme rhetoric now earns a sort of badge of ""coolness"" that can't be matched by those calling for cooler heads.To call for civility now seems unwoke. No wonder Symone Sanders of CNN stated, ""the folks calling for civility might need to check their privilege."" To be angry is to be justified; not being angry enough is the greatest sin.And that is dangerous. It's not that Americans will suddenly begin attacking one another in the streets. It's that large populations can be moved by small, extreme minorities.Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in his new book, ""Skin in the Game,"" about the phenomenon of ""renormalization,"" whereby larger, more moderate groups appease small minorities simply to avoid certain costs. That can happen when reasonable people stop standing up to advocates for mobocracy, afraid that doing so will alienate their most vocal supporters.Waters has always been a fringe figure. Perhaps she'll remain so. But there are no guarantees. And we shouldn't be sanguine about the prospects of quashing radical tribalism. It's not quite as easy as putting out a few tepid statements.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate Mongering

1481,A,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other major stock market averages are tanking Tuesday over President Donald Trump's latest threat of a full-scale trade war with China. Yet Trump's threat seems aimed at Capitol Hill, not Beijing.Here's why: After escalating his threat to impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports late Monday, Trump will meet with GOP senators on Wednesday and ask them to drop their opposition to his rescue of ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm driven out of business by U.S. sanctions.If Trump really intended to launch a trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs.A plunging Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite could help sway Republican senators to give Trump the flexibility he wants to strike a trade deal with China. But while the Dow Jones remained sharply lower at the close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pared losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIntraday on the stock market today, among Dow Jones components with big exposure to China, Caterpillar (CAT) lost 3.6% and Boeing (BA) 3.8%. Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) slipped 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Intel (INTC) pared its loss to 0.5%. The Dow Jones itself fell 1.15%, undercutting its 50-day moving average and headed for a sixth straight decline.Meanwhile, Deere (DE), which fares well when American farmers are thriving, has seen shares slide about 10% over the past five days. Qualcomm (QCOM), whose merger with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) appears tied up in U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations, fell 1%.Just a month ago, Trump was crowing about a China trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.That deal only came close to happening due to Trump's pledge via a tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department had ordered ZTE's U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate voted on Monday to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a must-pass defense funding bill. The White House has said it opposes the ZTE provision, but a Trump veto of a defense bill to save Chinese jobs would be awkward.Rather than looking weak with a veto, Trump's threat of dramatically escalating tariffs is a show of strength that has scared investors and may also scare Republican senators into backing down.Trump already showed his cards with the underwhelming China trade deal he touted last month. He has no stomach for a trade war that makes American farmers pay the price. He also reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he won't impose tariffs on Apple iPhones assembled in China. Trump had seemed set to sign onto a deal that would have done relatively little to narrow the massive U.S. trade deficit with China.While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action vs. ZTE was separate from talk talks, it's clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't agree.After Trump's leniency prompted a backlash and left the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators frustrated their American counterparts seeking to finalize an agreement and win more concessions. That strengthened the hand of Trump officials who have advocated a hard line vs. China and had Trump's first round of threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports all ready to go.Any time such threats are made and deadlines are set, there's risk involved. Beijing has a reputation for refusing to back down from a threat. If talks go nowhere before a July 6 deadline for imposing 25% tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports, the trade spat may spiral into something more serious. Yet if Trump follows through on his ZTE rescue, the negotiating environment is likely to improve, and there's probably a deal Trump will accept, at least in the short term.Any trade agreement is likely to please Wall Street, but it's sure to be just a cease-fire in what promises to be a longer term U.S. technological cold war with China.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Forget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

1482,A,"We celebrate the Fourth of July because that's the day the Declaration of Independence was signed, 242 years ago. You might call July 4 America's birthday.The Declaration didn't just declare our independence from Britain; it vowed to create a government that respected all people's rights to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""It said nothing about patriotism. Or making America ""great.""America became great because the Declaration (and the Constitution that followed) set down rules that kept government small and out of the way. That let creative individuals flourish.When the Declaration was signed, the founders didn't know what America would look like. They knew, though, that they were sick of being bossed around by the British king, so they worried about government having too much power.Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues wrote the Declaration to assert that our ""natural rights"" could not be taken away by any government, and to set the stage for the creation of a government through which people could rule themselves.At the time, America was considered a backwater. Just a few years later, America had become the most prosperous, and probably the freest, country in the world.The Fourth of July is not about barbecues, fireworks or even patriotism. It's about that idea: that people have the right to rule themselves.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIronically, government has grown so much since the founding that you might not even be able to buy fireworks where you live. In much of America they are now illegal because government officials have declared them to be too dangerous.Yet the Declaration and Constitution weren't written to make government provide for public safety. The founders assumed that was something adults would do for themselves. The founding documents are about freedom -- about limiting what government can do.""Trust no man with too much government power,"" wrote Jefferson. ""(B)ind them with the chains of the Constitution.""It's good that the Declaration and Constitution have those ""chains."" No matter how insistent the state's busybodies get, they may not arbitrarily search our homes or jail us. We have a right to bear arms, to practice whatever religions we choose, to exercise free speech and more.Growing government has eroded some of our freedoms, but we still have more freedoms than most countries in the world.Consider the country we declared independence from, Great Britain. Authorities there recently locked up a man merely because he made a Facebook live video outside a courthouse. He wanted to draw attention to child abusers on trial, but Britain's government puts limits on what reporters may cover. England has no First Amendment.Some people who write critical things on Facebook or Twitter get visits from police.Great Britain also has no Second Amendment, and has far more restrictions on guns than we have. That hasn't stopped crime. London had more murders than New York City this spring.Now London's mayor wants ""knife control."" Really.One British police department even bragged about its ""weapon sweep"" that confiscated ""scissors and pliers."" But don't worry, tweeted the Regents Police Agency, they were ""safely disposed and taken off the streets.""I'm glad I live in America, where I can carry pliers around. And speak freely.Of course, the Constitution has more limits on government power than just the ones stated in the Bill of Rights.The Constitution divided government in ways meant to limit authoritarian politicians from any party.President Donald Trump's own Supreme Court nominee rebuked the man who appointed him, ruling that a Trump-advocated law making it easier to deport some immigrants was too vague.The Court stopped President Obama almost a hundred times.It's a good thing we have both the Declaration and the Constitution, with their curbs on power-grabs by presidents and legislators -- curbs on judges, too.Unfortunately, those limits on government haven't exactly kept government small. Thomas Jefferson wanted ""a wise and frugal government"" that leaves people ""free to regulate their own pursuits."" Now we've got 180,000 pages of federal rules and $21 trillion in debt.Still, the Constitution and the Declaration have helped keep us mostly free. That's something to celebrate this Fourth of July.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

1489,A,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products. The official announcement will come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect. China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, matching the U.S. dollar for dollar.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAdobe Systems earnings rose 63% vs. a year earlier to $1.66 a share, beating second-quarter views for $1.54. Revenue climbed 24% to $2.20 billion, modestly topping. The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours. AT&T stock edged higher.During the regular session, Baidu (BIDU) spinoff iQiyi ran up nearly 17%, YY (YY) spinoff Huya jumped 13%, and Bilibili climbed 2.1%.

1497,A,"War On Poverty: What would you think of a tax system that imposed effective marginal tax rates of up to 80% on low-income families? That's what exists today thanks to various federal benefit programs that phase out while income rises.At a recent panel on poverty, the Congressional Budget Office made a presentation showing how income and benefit programs interact in ways that can heavily discourage work.The CBO looked at a single parent with one child living in Pennsylvania, and what would happen to her net income — from wages and benefits — as she started to make more money from work. That meant counting not just how much she'd pay in income taxes and payroll taxes on each extra dollar of earnings, but how much she'd lose in food stamps, health subsidies, and other income-based programs.The result is rather disturbing. If she took a job that paid $10,000 a year, her effective marginal tax rate would be a 50%. That is, for every dollar she made, she'd gain only 50 cents after taxes and benefit cuts.When her income reached $20,000, the effective marginal rate climbed to a stunning 80%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe CBO found that more than three-quarters of low- and moderate-income taxpayers face marginal rates of 20% or more, and that, overall the average rate is 31%.Keep in mind that the top income tax rate — which kicks in at $500,000 for a single person — is just 37%.Why are these marginal rates for this single mom so high? Because as she makes more money, her benefits phase out. For example, someone in the phaseout range of food stamps faces an effective additional marginal tax of 14%.Economists have long understood that high marginal tax rates are a disincentive to work. As the CBO put it, ""when marginal tax rates are high, people tend to respond to the smaller financial gain from employment by working fewer hours.""Yet while politicians are hyperfocused on the top marginal rate, they rarely look at the impact of high marginal rates on the working poor.This is important for two reasons. First, poorly designed benefit programs can trap people in poverty.

1504,A,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft (MSFT) believes 2018 will be the year when blockchain finally goes mainstream.XMark Russinovich, chief technology officer for the software giant's Azure cloud platform, said a whole range of industries are on the cusp of introducing the electronic ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.""People have been saying for the last couple of years it will be the year of production blockchain for enterprises, and I think this year we're actually starting to see them go into production,"" he told IBD Thursday at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.Blockchain stores information chronologically in ""blocks"" to allow for the efficient and nearly instantaneous processing and transfer of data. According to Russinovich, just about every enterprise will be using it in one way or another in the years to come.""I think this is the beginning of the point where now these technologies are becoming mainstream enough, people understand it enough, that they can begin to deploy it,"" he said. ""I expect this to grow pretty rapidly in the next couple of years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe sees the key benefits for businesses as being the reduction in the chance of fraud (as the technology is extremely difficult to hack), the reduction of waste and the elimination of middlemen.The executive said his firm has been working with ""dozens of companies""to develop usable applications for blockchain, including Wall Street giants such as Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The company has now rolled out tools to simplify the process of deploying the technology for customers.And he highlighted two companies that have been making great strides in blockchain: industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM) and Australian travel firm Webjet.""3M are doing it to track the provenance of pharmaceuticals, to make sure that when a customer gets it they can verify it came from a reputable source. There's so much fraud in the pharmaceutical industry,"" Russinovich said during a speech at the Yahoo Finance event.Blockchain offered Webjet a way to streamline a typically cumbersome process. The firm found that during a single transaction, like a hotel room going to an end user, five smaller transactions are involved. And that is only the beginning of the problems.""They found that roughly 1 in 10 of those transactions require some kind of manual intervention because of a problem along the way. In roughly 1 in 25, someone on that chain doesn't get paid. So there's a lot of loss, and there is also a lot of fraud,"" Russinovich said. ""They've turned to operationalizing blockchain on top of an Ethereum platform on Azure and created a network called Reschain.

The first is the Workbench platform, which provides an interface that allows business users to construct solutions that suit their needs. It provides prebuilt networks and infrastructure.The second product is the Coco Framework, which allows companies to use blockchain while keeping their data private. This is important, as it allows companies to retain the confidentiality of their dealings with various suppliers and customers.Russinovich believes Microsoft is leading the way on blockchain over cloud space rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and he said customers have provided encouraging feedback on their offerings.""Response has been great.

1507,A,"A day of reckoning is near for Tesla stock, the Model 3 sedan and the company's colorful co-founder and chief executive, Elon Musk.By the end of this month, Tesla (TSLA) plans to finally live up to Musk's repeated vow to crank out 5,000 Model 3s — billed as a sedan for the masses — each week. In the coming quarter, the maker of luxury electric cars aims to make good on Musk's relentless promise to be profitable. And in the process, the company and its CEO hope to reassure investors that Tesla's $10.5 billion debt burden and scorching cash burn will soon be in the rearview mirror.It's heady corporate drama. Will Tesla ultimately become a new-age General Motors (GM), a force majeure in the rising electric-car industry? Or will its far-reaching vision fall short?Musk, a modern-day corporate magnate, is determined to blast skeptical short sellers worried about the Tesla cash burn by mass-producing Model 3s.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWall Street is divided on whether Musk and Tesla can pull it off. Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura and a Tesla stock bull, points out that the company has a two-year backlog of Model 3 orders to help smooth the road ahead.""They don't have an issue with demand,"" said Shah.Still, Tesla short-seller Mark Spiegel, manager at hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Management, said he considers the carmaker to be ""a company so landmine-filled that I think it can implode at any time.""Tesla stock is one of the most shorted issues on Wall Street. Those counting on the Tesla cash burn to help it fail are betting it will miss its production targets for the new Model 3 for the third time, putting the company in a financially risky situation.Short sellers get Musk's dander up. The Tesla chief recently tweeted he would torch them with one of the flamethrowers he had made as a moneymaking promotion for one of his other ventures, the tunnel-digging Boring Co.""Short burn of the century coming soon,"" Musk wrote in a tweet last month. ""Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.""It's unclear, though, just who faces the heat. The Tesla cash burn recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. The usually cheeky Musk has become curt at news conferences. Company goals keep falling by the wayside.Much of it stems from the Model 3. If Tesla can more than double Model 3 output from the prior quarter to 5,000 a week, Musk believes the company can be profitable in the third quarter and avoid having to raise cash. But profitability has continually eluded the company.Musk most recently attacked short sellers on June 17, saying they had about three weeks ""before their short position explodes."" That time frame coincides with the end of the second quarter and would be about the time Tesla typically reports quarterly vehicle deliveries. A number above expectations could send Tesla stock soaring even higher than the more than 20% jump it has seen since hitting a low four weeks ago.Tesla shares were down 0.3%, near 332.70 during Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 386.99 set on Sept. 18.Musk, though, is known for setting ambitious deadlines he often can't meet. The Roadster, the Model S, Model X and the Model 3 were all delayed from his original timeline.Still, his ambitions persist. Musk plans to double Model 3 production again to 10,000 as it adds a third production line at its Fremont, Calif., manufacturing plant — a line that is being built temporarily under a tent.Tesla's long-term Model 3 goal is to ramp up production to 500,000 vehicles per year. That's a huge leap from its 100,000 annual run rate for the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle.Further, Tesla still promises to price the Model 3 at $35,000, a version that has yet to materialize. The Model 3s coming off the line now are loaded with extras and go for roughly $50,000.Another obstacle for Tesla is expanding its massive battery plant in the Nevada desert to supply power for all those cars. The 5.8-million-square-foot plant, called Gigafactory 1, already has cost more than $1 billion.Further, Tesla seeks to add gigafactories in China and Europe. It also will need more retail outlets, service centers and charging stations.All this is going on at the same time Tesla is developing the Model Y, a crossover vehicle, in addition to a big-rig truck called Semi and a new Roadster.Perhaps the biggest albatross hanging around the company's neck, though, is the $10.5 billion in debt that could grow further.""Of course, the debt load concerns me,"" said Brad Erickson, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""But the reality is: With the manufacturing improvements and the plodding toward profitability, the cash burns go down dramatically. If Tesla can make the Model 3 in greater quantity, we believe they will turn gross-margin positive in the third quarter.""The Tesla cash burn will decline dramatically, if not halt, should current Model 3 targets be met, he said. ""So the moment you're not burning cash anymore, that's a moot point,"" Erickson said.When Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on May 2, it showed a cash balance of $2.67 billion. It burned through $1.1 billion in cash during the quarter. It isn't clear how much it's spent in the current quarter.But it will need to spend billions of dollars more as it expands vehicle production and invests in batteries and other infrastructure. Skeptics say that only cash injections from the outside can help.In March, financial pressures and production shortfalls spurred Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Tesla's credit rating to B3, from B2. That's six levels below investment grade.Moody's said Tesla faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and pending debt maturities. Moody's thinks the company needs to raise $2 billion to cover the Tesla cash burn for 2018.Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino said in a report last month that Tesla could need to raise more than $10 billion in capital by 2020 to fund operations and expansion. That includes the cost of a new facility in China that could serve as both a vehicle manufacturing plant and gigafactory.He has a sell rating on Tesla stock with a six-month price target of 195, little more than half of where it currently trades, around 360. Tamberrino is skeptical that Tesla will meet its production goals for the Model 3. He forecasts that the company will run low on cash by year-end.Other Tesla stock skeptics include UBS analyst Colin Langan, who has a sell rating on Tesla stock, also with a price target of 195. Langan, in a research note last month, said he remains cautious on Tesla stock, ""given the cash burn, the volatile and uncertain production timeline, and initial quality concerns."" He also said it's unclear how Tesla can fund its aggressive product plans.Ryan Brinkman at JPMorgan, a Tesla bear, has a price target of 180 and rating of underweight.KeyBanc's Erickson is also critical of Musk for mismanaging expectations and being a poor forecaster of his business. On the other hand, he says, Musk is on a long leash.""Who else can announce an electric car in a webcast and not advertise or say when the car will come and take in nearly a half-billion dollars in deposits?"" said Erickson. He was citing the company's Model 3 debut.Nomura's Shah, perhaps the most bullish analyst for the company on Wall Street, says the Tesla cash burn doesn't worry him. He recently raised his Tesla price target to 450 from 420, with a buy rating. That's roughly a 25% premium from where the stock now trades.Narrowly focusing on Tesla's balance sheet is a backward way of looking at things, he says.""We see them overcoming the production issues and accelerating growth in the back half of this year for Model 3,"" Shah said. ""I expect that in the next three months we'll go from talking about the balance sheet and negative cash flows to market opportunity and market growth.""Shah's confidence in Tesla is due in part to the company's size and fast growth. Revenue rose 68% in 2017 to $11.76 billion from the year-ago period. That comes after 73% growth in the previous year, though Tesla can boast of only two profitable quarters.""It's really unusual to find a company in the multibillion-dollar range growing revenue more than 60% per year,"" Shah said. ""I don't see that slowing down.""The Model 3 comes just as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), BMW, Volkswagen (VLKAY), Toyota Motor (TM) and others threaten its standing among electric-car makers.General Motors previously announced a goal to make 1 million GM electric vehicles a year by 2026. Ford has said it will invest $11 billion in electric-vehicle production.Among the challenges faced by Musk is that he's stretched thin. Musk spends about half his time as chief executive of SpaceX, which is routinely launching satellites.Musk also runs Boring Co., which is more of a side project. It promises to lessen traffic congestion by digging underground tunnels for high-speed transportation. The multiple demands could be among the reasons Musk abruptly cut off analysts halfway through Tesla's first-quarter conference call for posing what he called ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" questions.Despite Tesla's history of burning cash at a rate better-established companies would likely be crucified for, Musk has steadfastly opposed the idea of raising more equity or debt later this year. Tesla says it has significantly cut its projected capital expenditures by focusing on critical near-term needs.The company recently laid off 9% of the Tesla workforce, part of a thorough reorganization announced in May. Musk said the cutbacks would not affect the company's ability to reach Model 3 production targets.Musk expects cash flow from selling Model 3s to the 450,000-plus people who have placed a $1,000 reservation deposit. He says that will help fund several Tesla initiatives. Among them are its gigafactory expansion and a new plant to make the Model Y crossover vehicle.During the recent Tesla annual shareholder meeting, Musk once again reiterated his target of becoming cash-flow positive in the third quarter of this year with the ramped-up production for the Model 3.Tesla could meet its production targets. But it also will have to meet targets for higher gross margins to hit profitability.Several Wall Street analysts consider that unrealistic, given the company's missed production goals and high debt.Then there are the short sellers. Among the most vocal is Stanphyl Capital's Spiegel.""I don't think Musk can make this company profitable, or even save it at this point because of all the debt,"" said Spiegel. ""The company seems to require more than $4 billion a year, and that's without building a second factory to make the Model Y, or a truck.""Spiegel also thinks Tesla is on shaky ground because of the $7,500 federal tax credit that buyers of electric vehicles can receive.That tax credit has limits. It's available to the first 200,000 U.S. Tesla buyers, as is the case with other electric-car manufacturers. Upon meeting the 200,000 threshold, the credit begins to gradually wind down over the next several quarters.Tesla should hit the 200,000 limit this year. That would effectively raise prices for buyers of Tesla vehicles. General Motors is also nearing its limit, but new providers of electric vehicles will have the full $7,500 credit.Yet, as Erickson notes, Musk has come out on top many times.""It would be foolish to count him out at this stage of the game given all that he has been able to accomplish to date,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Three Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals, And These China Stocks Keep TumblingCheck Out Top Stocks Near A Buy Point NowYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeGet All The Latest Tesla News, Stock Chart And More

1514,A,"General Motors (GM) posted solid growth in second-quarter U.S. auto sales Tuesday, while Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM) and Honda Motor (HMC) all beat estimates for June sales. Nissan (NSANY) grew new vehicle sales 1% in June, beating forecasts of a sharp decline and benefiting from overall robust demand for SUVs, truck and crossovers.But GM stock and other other auto stocks sold off with the S&P 500 index and other major averages. The group has been in a slump in weeks as President Trump's trade rhetoric turned to auto tariffs. A saturated market, steep vehicle prices, and rising interest rates also continue to weigh on the auto industry.The annualized pace of new vehicle sales in June rose to 17.5 million after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Autodata. Automakers got a boost from an extra selling day and weekend last month, as well as a solid labor market, which offset rising gas prices and interest rates.Cox Automotive revised its full-year SAAR forecast (seasonally adjusted annual rate) upward to 16.8 million from 16.7 million.""The first half of 2018 has been stronger than we expected with the new light-vehicle SAAR staying above 17 million,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive.

1515,A,"IBD's Dividend Leaders screen often unearths stocks prone to hold their ground when the market turns rough. Gas pipeline operator Oneok (OKE) is a dividend stock that fits the bill.The Tulsa, Okla.-based company projects 9% to 11% annual dividend growth through 2021. The consensus estimate sees earnings accelerating to triple-digit growth in the second quarter. And the stock is trade war-resistant, unshaken by the market's recent volatility and up 13% from an early May breakout.Oneok (pronounced one-oak) operates pipelines that gather raw natural gas directly from production areas. Its fractionation facilities divide that into natural gas (methane) and related natural gas liquids (pentane, butane, ethane). It then directs those separate products to various markets, distributors and customers via pipelines that it and other operators own.Oneok is a leading player across the Rocky Mountain region, the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle area the energy industry calls the midcontinent, and the bustling Permian Basin in west Texas. Recovering energy demand in the U.S. and overseas continues to boost demand for oil.Rising oil production leads to increasing supplies of natural gas.Oil wells produce varying levels of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Traditionally, those byproducts were ""flared off"" — vented to create a gas torch constantly burning over an oil well. Environmental regulations have begun to clamp down on the practice.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut still, Bloomberg reports that 15% of natural gas produced in North Dakota was flared off in April. That 15% limit decreases to 12% in November and 9% in 2020. At the same time, production is rising. The combination mean more gas lines are needed, and Oneok is among the leaders working to put more ""take-away"" capacity in place in the Williston and Powder River Basins, which include the Bakken and Niobrara shale fields.Oneok was also among the large group of pipeline operations that first broke off physical assets into a master limited partnership, Oneok Partners. Used as a vehicle to generate high cash flow payouts — both to the company and to investors — the industrywide scheme ran up against problems as the spun off companies maxed out their payments to their parent companies.Oneok then followed the industry's reverse trend: parents buying back their master limited partnership spinouts. Oneok announced in February last year that it had arranged a $9.3 billion stock deal to regain full ownership of Oneok Partners. The deal, completed in June, 2017, enabled Oneok to boost its dividend 21%.The downside is debt. The all-stock deal avoided ratcheting up Oneok's debt load. But the company still reported $8.52 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2017. That gave it a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 146%. That's well within the bounds of its peers, but still meant Oneok paid interest on long-term debt of $436.1 million for the year.Oneok's annual earnings have been up and down over the past four years. Consensus views project a 62% EPS gain this year, and acceleration to 100% growth in the second quarter.The stock is extended 13% from the 61.46 buy point of a flat base.

1521,A,"We celebrate the Fourth of July because that's the day the Declaration of Independence was signed, 242 years ago. You might call July 4 America's birthday.The Declaration didn't just declare our independence from Britain; it vowed to create a government that respected all people's rights to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""It said nothing about patriotism. Or making America ""great.""America became great because the Declaration (and the Constitution that followed) set down rules that kept government small and out of the way. That let creative individuals flourish.When the Declaration was signed, the founders didn't know what America would look like. They knew, though, that they were sick of being bossed around by the British king, so they worried about government having too much power.Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues wrote the Declaration to assert that our ""natural rights"" could not be taken away by any government, and to set the stage for the creation of a government through which people could rule themselves.At the time, America was considered a backwater. Just a few years later, America had become the most prosperous, and probably the freest, country in the world.The Fourth of July is not about barbecues, fireworks or even patriotism. It's about that idea: that people have the right to rule themselves.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIronically, government has grown so much since the founding that you might not even be able to buy fireworks where you live. In much of America they are now illegal because government officials have declared them to be too dangerous.Yet the Declaration and Constitution weren't written to make government provide for public safety. The founders assumed that was something adults would do for themselves. The founding documents are about freedom -- about limiting what government can do.""Trust no man with too much government power,"" wrote Jefferson. ""(B)ind them with the chains of the Constitution.""It's good that the Declaration and Constitution have those ""chains."" No matter how insistent the state's busybodies get, they may not arbitrarily search our homes or jail us. We have a right to bear arms, to practice whatever religions we choose, to exercise free speech and more.Growing government has eroded some of our freedoms, but we still have more freedoms than most countries in the world.Consider the country we declared independence from, Great Britain. Authorities there recently locked up a man merely because he made a Facebook live video outside a courthouse.

The cryptocurrency's 2018 crash may help cement its place in the bubble record books.Down 70% from its December high after sliding for a fourth straight day on Friday, Bitcoin is getting ever-closer to matching the Nasdaq composite's 78% peak-to-trough plunge after the U.S. dot-com bubble burst.

1527,A,"Last week, on the MSNBC TV show ""Morning Joe,"" MSNBC contributor Donny Deutsch said that every American who votes for President Donald Trump is a Nazi. His exact words: ""If you vote for Trump, then you, the voter — you, not Donald Trump — are standing at the border like Nazis going, 'You here. You here.'""Now, as virtually every Jew of Deutsch's generation knows, a Nazi saying, ""You here. You here,"" refers to guards at Nazi extermination camps sending Jews to gas chambers or to work the barracks.Also last week, Gen. Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA (a fact that, among other things, gives credence to the increasingly widespread realization that our intelligence elites have been morally and intellectually compromised) tweeted a photo of the tracks leading into Auschwitz-Birkenau, the most infamous Nazi extermination and concentration camps, with the caption ""Other governments have separated mothers and children.""Deutsch, Hayden and the myriad other fools who compare Trump to Hitler and the Nazis have utterly trivialized the Holocaust. As everyone who isn't on the left knows, there is nothing morally analogous between the way the last three presidential administrations dealt with some children of immigrants who are in the country illegally and what the Nazis did to Jewish children.American children are routinely separated from their parent when that parent is arrested, and if the arrestee is a single parent, the child is taken into government custody until other arrangements can be made. With regard to immigrants who are in the country illegally, the only way to avoid separation is to place the children in detention along with their arrested parent(s). But this was expressly forbidden by the most left-wing court in America — the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — if detention lasts longer than 20 days, as it nearly always does when either a not-guilty plea or an asylum claim is made.Moreover, as awful as separation from a parent is, these children were not treated like animals in cages but transferred to the care of relatives or foster homes, or housed with other detained children where they were provided with room, board, education, sports facilities, etc.By contrast, Jewish children separated from their parents by Nazi guards were sent to gas chambers to die a gruesome, painful death by their lungs being filled with poisonous gas. And their parents almost always eventually suffered the same fate unless they were worked, starved or tortured to death.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseComparing the two is not only a trivialization of the Holocaust; it is actually a form of Holocaust denial.If Jewish children were treated by the Nazis the same way Central American children have been by America, then everything we know about the Holocaust is false. Jewish children weren't subjected to torturous medical experimentation, and they weren't gassed and cremated. They were simply separated from their Jewish parents for a finite period of time, sent to stay with Jewish relatives or provided for by foster families while their parents were detained pending due-process legal proceedings. According to Donny Deutsch, Michael Hayden and all the leftists comparing America and Trump to the Nazis, Jewish children weren't gassed; they played soccer while waiting to be reunited with their parents.What is even more depressing than Deutsch and Hayden is the reaction — or silence — of most American Jewish organizations.The Anti-Defamation League, which once defended Jewish interests, is becoming just another leftist interest group. I looked for some condemnation of Deutsch or Hayden and found none. Instead, in the words of the Israeli (left-wing) newspaper Haaretz, the ADL ""made a direct comparison to the Holocaust."" It tweeted: ""Children separated from their parents during the Holocaust speak out about the trauma it has caused. How can anyone defend such inhumane policies?""The only criticism the ADL could muster was this: ""People need to be extremely careful in drawing comparisons to the Holocaust and the Nazi regime in whatever context it is used."" But it offered no condemnation of those who actually made this odious comparison.Leftism has poisoned much of American Jewish life. That is the primary reason, as reported in the just-released American Jewish Committee poll, American and Israeli Jews are so divided on so many issues.There were rabbis who announced they fasted when Trump was elected. Non-Orthodox synagogues around America sat shiva (the religious mourning period for a deceased immediate family member) when Trump won. And the Hebrew Union College, the Reform Jewish movement's rabbinical seminary, had an Israel-hating writer as this year's graduation speaker.If you support Trump or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or hold almost any traditional Jewish worldview — like God creating the human being as male and female — you must either hide your opinion or risk being ostracized at almost any non-Orthodox synagogue.To their credit, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Zionist Organization of America and a few other organizations did condemn those who equate America under Trump with Nazi Germany. But most Jewish organizations kept quiet, offered tepid caution or actually echoed the sentiment.In other words, at this time many American Jewish organizations are bad for the Jews, bad for Judaism and trivialize the Holocaust in order to score political points.If it's any comfort (and it isn't), things are no better in mainstream Protestantism or at the Vatican.But here is real comfort: If the left keeps on smearing nearly half its fellow Americans as Nazis, it will assure more Republican victories this coming November.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate Mongering

1530,A,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit.

1546,A,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day. The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina right now is set to slap a further 25% tariff on U.S.-built cars and SUVs. That will hit Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and others. Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted. Those tariffs still face a final review, but their likelihood will rise markedly if the first round of tariffs takes effect.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Economists expect the June employment report to show the U.S. added 190,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held at 3.8%. The Labor Department report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.Average hourly earnings is the big number to watch. Expect annual wage growth to tick up to 2.8%. That would match the best pay gain since 2009.Costco (COST) boosted its starting wage by $1 and other wages by 25-50 cents an hour effective June 11. That followed wage hikes earlier this year by Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Kroger (KR) and more.Rising wage growth would offer more evidence that the historical link between lower unemployment and higher pay is still intact. Higher wages, in turn, are expected to fuel higher inflation. Any upside surprise in wages will boost odds of a third and fourth Fed hike this year, as long as rising trade war fears don't curb economic enthusiasm.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Breakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

1547,A,"Oil steadied just below $67 a barrel as Saudi Arabia's energy minister said an OPEC agreement to raise production is ""inevitable.""Futures in New York rose 0.5% early Thursday after a 1.4% increase in the past three sessions. After talks in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday he expects OPEC to reach a deal to gradually boost output. His Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said they agree on the need for an increase, but the volume and timing of the extra production are still under discussion.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will meet next week in Vienna at what's likely to be a contentious summit. Saudi Arabia and Russia are facing opposition from Iraq, Iran and Venezuela on their proposal to relax output caps, while Washington continues to criticize the cartel for boosting prices.

The contract climbed 28 cents to $66.64 on Wednesday. Total volume traded Thursday was about 21% below the 100-day average.Brent futures for August settlement traded at $76.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, up 6 cents. The contract advanced 86 cents on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a $9.97 premium to WTI for the same month.Crude rallied to a three-year high in May, and subsequently lost steam as Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they may raise output. Despite their proposal, President Trump on Wednesday criticized OPEC for inflating prices. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said Iran and Venezuela could lose almost 30% of their output by the end of next year due to U.S. sanctions and economic upheaval, requiring extra supplies from OPEC's Gulf members.Saudi Arabia is mulling various different scenarios to raise supplies. One proposal envisages a single hike of just 500,000 barrels a day. Another would see an immediate increase of 500,000 barrels followed by a similar addition in the fourth quarter. The kingdom has also shared ideas that float an increase of about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day.In the U.S., government data showed crude stockpiles declined by 4.14 million barrels last week, steeper than estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The drop also ran counter to an industry report a day earlier showing an increase. Gasoline and distillates also slid last week, the Energy Information Administration said. Meanwhile, crude production rose to 10.9 million barrels a day, topping 10 million every week since early February.

1550,A,"Timothy Carpenter's interest in smartphones has had two unintended consequences. It has drawn the Supreme Court deeper into ongoing debates about applying the Constitution's Fourth Amendment to uses of digital technologies that have swiftly — the first iPhone was sold in 2007; today there are 396 million American cellphone service accounts — become integral to daily life.And the disagreement between Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the court's decision disapproving how law enforcement convicted Carpenter, and Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's implacable ""originalist,"" has illuminated an argument about how properly to construe the Constitution.Carpenter's gang stole smartphones from stores in and around Detroit. While doing this, his cellphone, like all such, was in constant — several times a minute — contact with cell towers. Each tower makes time-stamped records of when and where (within half a mile to two mile radius) a particular cellphone enters and leaves its area of coverage. The towers gather this data any time the phone is on, even if it is not in use. The police, who had a confession from a participant in the robberies, got various wireless carriers to produce 127 days' worth of data from 12,898 location points documenting Carpenter's movements, which closely coincided with the locations of robberies.Federal law says the government can obtain such records without a warrant by merely supplying ""specific and articulable facts"" supporting a reasonable belief that the records are relevant to a criminal investigation — a less exacting requirement than demonstrating ""probable cause"" for a warrant. At trial, before he was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison, Carpenter unsuccessfully sought to exclude the cell tower data on the ground that obtaining it should have required a warrant. The divided (5-4) Supreme Court agreed with Carpenter's invocation of the Fourth Amendment, which says: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause ... particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""The average smartphone user does not intend to disclose, or leave to third parties the power to disclose, what Roberts correctly calls ""an all-encompassing record"" of the user's whereabouts, ""an intimate window into a person's"" movements, and through them into ""familial, political, professional, religious and sexual associations."" Hence the court has hitherto held that, given smartphones' ""immense storage capacity,"" police ""must generally obtain a warrant before searching the contents of a phone.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRoberts notes that Americans ""compulsively carry"" their phones: Three-quarters of users say they usually are within five feet of their phones; 12 percent admit to using their phones while showering. Roberts says of the carriers siphoning up this data: ""Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible."" Perhaps .01 percent of users understand that their cellphones constantly dispense data about their movements, so this dispensing is not meaningfully ""voluntary.""Attempting to assuage the doubting Thomas, Roberts insists that protecting ""privacy"" from new digital technologies accords with ""Founding-era understandings"" because the Founders' ""central aim"" was to impede ""surveillance"" that is ""too permeating."" Thomas, unassuaged, strictly adheres to the Constitution's text, which, he stresses, nowhere mentions ""privacy."" The Fourth Amendment, he insists (with his italics), secures individuals against unreasonable searches of ""their persons, houses, papers, and effects."" By gathering several carriers' cell site records of Carpenter's movements, the government did not search his property: ""He did not create the records, he does not maintain them, he cannot control them, and he cannot destroy them.""There is a circularity to the court's test of whether, regarding this or that, the public has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"": The court's decisions powerfully shape the expectations that purport to control the decisions. And Thomas is right about the original public understanding of the Framers' words in the amendment.

1555,A,"Timothy Carpenter's interest in smartphones has had two unintended consequences. It has drawn the Supreme Court deeper into ongoing debates about applying the Constitution's Fourth Amendment to uses of digital technologies that have swiftly — the first iPhone was sold in 2007; today there are 396 million American cellphone service accounts — become integral to daily life.And the disagreement between Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the court's decision disapproving how law enforcement convicted Carpenter, and Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's implacable ""originalist,"" has illuminated an argument about how properly to construe the Constitution.Carpenter's gang stole smartphones from stores in and around Detroit. While doing this, his cellphone, like all such, was in constant — several times a minute — contact with cell towers. Each tower makes time-stamped records of when and where (within half a mile to two mile radius) a particular cellphone enters and leaves its area of coverage. The towers gather this data any time the phone is on, even if it is not in use. The police, who had a confession from a participant in the robberies, got various wireless carriers to produce 127 days' worth of data from 12,898 location points documenting Carpenter's movements, which closely coincided with the locations of robberies.Federal law says the government can obtain such records without a warrant by merely supplying ""specific and articulable facts"" supporting a reasonable belief that the records are relevant to a criminal investigation — a less exacting requirement than demonstrating ""probable cause"" for a warrant. At trial, before he was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison, Carpenter unsuccessfully sought to exclude the cell tower data on the ground that obtaining it should have required a warrant. The divided (5-4) Supreme Court agreed with Carpenter's invocation of the Fourth Amendment, which says: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause ... particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""The average smartphone user does not intend to disclose, or leave to third parties the power to disclose, what Roberts correctly calls ""an all-encompassing record"" of the user's whereabouts, ""an intimate window into a person's"" movements, and through them into ""familial, political, professional, religious and sexual associations."" Hence the court has hitherto held that, given smartphones' ""immense storage capacity,"" police ""must generally obtain a warrant before searching the contents of a phone.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRoberts notes that Americans ""compulsively carry"" their phones: Three-quarters of users say they usually are within five feet of their phones; 12 percent admit to using their phones while showering. Roberts says of the carriers siphoning up this data: ""Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible."" Perhaps .01 percent of users understand that their cellphones constantly dispense data about their movements, so this dispensing is not meaningfully ""voluntary.""Attempting to assuage the doubting Thomas, Roberts insists that protecting ""privacy"" from new digital technologies accords with ""Founding-era understandings"" because the Founders' ""central aim"" was to impede ""surveillance"" that is ""too permeating."" Thomas, unassuaged, strictly adheres to the Constitution's text, which, he stresses, nowhere mentions ""privacy."" The Fourth Amendment, he insists (with his italics), secures individuals against unreasonable searches of ""their persons, houses, papers, and effects."" By gathering several carriers' cell site records of Carpenter's movements, the government did not search his property: ""He did not create the records, he does not maintain them, he cannot control them, and he cannot destroy them.""There is a circularity to the court's test of whether, regarding this or that, the public has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"": The court's decisions powerfully shape the expectations that purport to control the decisions. And Thomas is right about the original public understanding of the Framers' words in the amendment. Roberts, however, is true to the Framers' intent, which was to forever secure individuals from what the Framers called ""unreasonable searches."" Today, fidelity to that original purpose requires protecting what we call, and what they would recognize as synonymous, privacy that is inseparable from liberty.The language is different; the intent is not. By focusing on the original public meaning of words rather than on original and unchanging purposes in changing contexts, Thomas intends to constrain courts.

1560,A,"Oil steadied just below $67 a barrel as Saudi Arabia's energy minister said an OPEC agreement to raise production is ""inevitable.""Futures in New York rose 0.5% early Thursday after a 1.4% increase in the past three sessions. After talks in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday he expects OPEC to reach a deal to gradually boost output. His Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said they agree on the need for an increase, but the volume and timing of the extra production are still under discussion.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will meet next week in Vienna at what's likely to be a contentious summit. Saudi Arabia and Russia are facing opposition from Iraq, Iran and Venezuela on their proposal to relax output caps, while Washington continues to criticize the cartel for boosting prices. Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman later Thursday.""Those in the know might get a hint as early as today — the topic will surely come up between President Putin and the Saudi crown prince as they watch their countries' teams in today's opening game of the football World Cup,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London.West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery traded at $66.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 35 cents, at 9:36 a.m. ET. The contract climbed 28 cents to $66.64 on Wednesday. Total volume traded Thursday was about 21% below the 100-day average.Brent futures for August settlement traded at $76.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, up 6 cents. The contract advanced 86 cents on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a $9.97 premium to WTI for the same month.Crude rallied to a three-year high in May, and subsequently lost steam as Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they may raise output. Despite their proposal, President Trump on Wednesday criticized OPEC for inflating prices. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said Iran and Venezuela could lose almost 30% of their output by the end of next year due to U.S. sanctions and economic upheaval, requiring extra supplies from OPEC's Gulf members.Saudi Arabia is mulling various different scenarios to raise supplies. One proposal envisages a single hike of just 500,000 barrels a day. Another would see an immediate increase of 500,000 barrels followed by a similar addition in the fourth quarter. The kingdom has also shared ideas that float an increase of about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day.In the U.S., government data showed crude stockpiles declined by 4.14 million barrels last week, steeper than estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The drop also ran counter to an industry report a day earlier showing an increase. Gasoline and distillates also slid last week, the Energy Information Administration said. Meanwhile, crude production rose to 10.9 million barrels a day, topping 10 million every week since early February.

1562,A,"July 4th is a generally more festive American holiday — with cookouts, parades, parties and fireworks — than other patriotic holidays, such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day.Most people forget that when the Declaration of Independence was drafted and signed on or about July 4th 1776 it was both a revolutionary and a somber occasion.It was revolutionary in being the first political doctrine in human history to assert that the rights of the people come from God, and not the state — which made those rights natural, absolute and ""unalienable.""But it was a somber occasion because in 1776 the odds of success in separating from England were dismal.  There was simply no way the irregular and poorly trained colonial army could prevail against the far greater number of disciplined forces of British army and navy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGreat Britain was the most powerful nation on Earth, while the 13 American colonies were disunited and relatively poor.While George Washington was an impressive leader, things looked grim for the Continental Army in the months following the Declaration of Independence.In the first major engagement Washington's army was defeated and forced to retreat by British General William Howe, who captured the prize of New York in September 1776.The following month in October 1776, the British defeated the Americans at the Battle of White Plains.  After that rout, the only point on Manhattan Island still held by the Americans was Fort Washington. But that didn't last.In the early morning of November 15, 1776, the British were joined by German Hessian soldiers, and the Americans were completely overwhelmed — barricaded inside of Fort Washington — with the British and Hessians firing unceasingly on them.By the time the Americans surrendered, they had lost 2,900 soldiers, nearly six times the casualties of British and Germans.General Washington was desperate to turn things around, and he finally led victorious campaigns in the Battle of Trenton and Princeton in December 1776 and January 1777.  But these were followed by reversals and defeat, such as at the Battle of Brandywine.And just weeks later, General Washington was once again outmaneuvered and humiliated by British General Howe, who succeeded in the ultimate symbolic victory of marching his British troops into Philadelphia in September of 1777, literally occupying what was then America's first capital — the city of the signing of the Declaration and the seat of the Continental Congress.And while the British were settling in, expropriating and inhabiting the homes of wealthy Philadelphians, thirty miles away George Washington was regrouping with his sick, weary and underfed troops in drafty tents during the cold winter of 1778 at Valley Forge.But as fate would have it, the hardship experienced at Valley Forge was a turning point of the War for Independence, for it was here that Washington, in desperation, sought God's intervention.The Diary of Nathaniel Snowden recounts the testimony of an eye-witness observer, who by chance encountered George Washington alone on his knees praying loudly in the snowy woods of Valley Forge.Snowden's account of Washington's prayer at that dark hour of the revolutionary struggle depicts him as beseeching ""God's deliverance of aid for the cause of the country, humanity and the world.""Indeed, Washington placed everything on the line for the cause as did the 56 signatories of the Declaration of Independence, citing in the last sentence of that document that ""with firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.""Without Washington's leadership, unrelenting perseverance, and reliance on the Almighty, the Declaration would probably have come to naught, with the subsequent revolution almost certainly failing.The Declaration of Independence, which we celebrate on July 4th, is not just what gave political birth to the United States, with its unique emphasis on limited government and the freedom for its citizens.It was the ensuing Constitution — drafted after the colonial army secured a final victory over the British at Yorktown — that provided a legal structure to implement the ideas in the Declaration in the form of a rule of law emphasizing accountability to the people.And that is what enabled the nation to prosper like no other in human history, becoming a ""shining city on a hill"" — the consequence of which was an amazing ascendance from colonial poverty to global superpower in less than 200 years.America now faces the greatest scandal of abuse of power in its history. And while times have changed in that regard, principles have not.May this July 4th be a special time, hopefully a turning point, for Americans to demand the prosecution of corruption in government and also to renew their appreciation of accountable and limited government.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1564,A,"Increasingly bitter and aggressive attacks on President Trump managed to bolster his approval rating, which climbed 5 points to reach the second highest level of his presidency, the latest IBD/TIPP Poll finds.The July poll found that 41% approve of the job Trump is doing. That's the first time he's been above 40% since March 2017, and just 1 point below his highest approval rating of 42% during his first month in office. Fifty-four disapprove of his job performance.Attacks on Trump intensified late last month in the wake of the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy toward those caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border — including families.That policy resulted in the temporary separation of children from their parents seeking asylum. Trump later signed an executive order to keep families together while asylum claims played out.In the span of a few days, a mob chased Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen out of a D.C. restaurant, the owner of the Red Hen in Virginia kicked Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders out. Actor Peter Fonda encouraged the abduction and molestation of the president's youngest son. Rep. Maxine Waters made remarks that appeared to encourage mob violence.Some Democrats worried that such antics would only help Trump, which the IBD/TIPP poll appears to confirm.At the same time, Trump scored a big win internationally with his summit meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. He also won a string of victories at the Supreme Court. Among other things, the court upheld Trump's travel ban on certain Muslim countries.Trump not only made gains among Republicans — 83% of whom now approve of the job he's doing — but among independents, whose approval climbed 5 points to 34%. His approval jumped 7 points among men and 2 points among women.Regionally, Trump's biggest gain came from the south (up 8 points) and rural areas (up 7 points). He also made strong gains among the young, high school educated, and lower income groups, as well as among blacks.The July IBD/TIPP Poll shows a four-point gain in Trump's favorability, which is currently -13 (40% favorable to 53% unfavorable).The broader IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index for Trump is now 44.3, an almost 8% gain over last month and the highest it's been since his second month in office.However, more say they'd prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats rather than Republicans after the midterm elections, 48% to 40%. The Democrats' +8 score on this generic ballot question is up a point from last month.The Real Clear Politics average of national polls on the generic ballot has Democrats up by 5.9 points. At the start of the year, Democrats were up by 13 points in the RCP average.And Trump's recent immigration actions are not winning a lot of support.The poll found that just 33% give him high marks for his handling of the situation involving families who've illegally crossed into the U.S. from Mexico. On a partisan basis, 67% of Republicans approved, 27% of independents, and 4% Democrats.The poll also found that a plurality (43%) say Trump's immigration policies have had no impact on security along the southern border. Forty say they've improved security; 13% say they've weakened it.Still, last month's poll found the public backing Trump on sanctuary cities. And the February IBD/TIPP Poll found that 50% approve of ""the construction of physical and electronic barriers along the southern U.S. border."" It also found that 55% back limits on chain migration.While Trump's approval rating improved, the FBI's has taken a beating in the wake of the inspector general's report detailing how FBI agents and officials bungled its investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information while secretary of State.The poll found that just 39% have a favorable view of the FBI, with 30% feeling unfavorable and 31% not sure.More than half of the public (53%) say political bias influenced the FBI's decision not to recommend charges against Clinton. Just 37% say politics didn't play a role.Not surprisingly, more than three-quarters of Republicans point to political bias for the FBI's exoneration of Clinton. But so do 55% of independents. Even among Democrats, more 1 in 5 (27%) say bias influenced the FBI's decision to drop the case against Clinton.The public splits on whether there was outright collusion between the FBI and Clinton, given revelations in an inspector general's report that FBI employees got gifts from reporters. While 44% say this is evidence of collusion, 47% say it isn't and 8% aren't sure.However, the public is also split on the question of Trump's colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.Forty-seven say that special counsel Robert Mueller would have produced evidence of collusion by now if there were any. But 49% say the lack of evidence after more than a year of investigation doesn't mean Trump is off the hook.Methodology: IBD/TIPP conducted the July poll from June 21 to June 29. It includes responses from 900 people nationwide, who were asked questions by live interviewers on phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.3 percentage points. (Toplines from the July IBD/TIPP Poll can be found here.)The IBD/TIPP Poll has been credited as being the most accurate poll in the past four presidential elections, and was one of only two that correctly predicted the outcome of the November 2016 presidential election.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:IBD/TIPP: America's Most Accurate PollsterPresidential Approval, Direction Of CountryEconomic Optimism Index

1565,A,"The principal objection raised by opponents to the T-Mobile-Sprint merger is that it will reduce competition in the wireless industry. That argument, which sounds intuitively valid at first, rests on two flaws.The first flaw is that opposition to the merger as anti-competitive ignores the relative sizes of the existing major four carriers. Verizon and AT&T each have roughly one-third of all wireless users, while T-Mobile and Sprint each have roughly one-sixth.Particularly in the face of the enormous capital costs of implementing 5G technology nationwide, the two smallest competitors have a structural competitive disadvantage. Combining them would make three roughly equal-size competitors.That's a formula that virtually guarantees robust competition.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWithout the merger, the smaller two will be capital-constrained. They will probably lag in the rollout of 5G, if not at the outset, then later.They could each wind up with such a technological disadvantage that they begin to lose customers on an irreversible trend that could easily conclude with only two surviving major carriers. That possibility should trouble any free-market advocate.How ironic it would be if the opponents of the merger claiming it would reduce competition unwittingly set the stage for greater concentration and far less competition in the long run.Three similar-sized competitors will compete vigorously. But two competitors can settle into a comfortable oligopoly, in which competition is merely symbolic rather than real.Some opponents of the merger are recycling successful arguments from opposition to the failed AT&T-T-Mobile merger attempt in 2011.  Those arguments do not apply to the current case.That merger would have been anti-competitive. Why? It would have taken one of the scrappiest and most creative competitors, T-Mobile, out of the game altogether. It would have left Sprint alone as the only challenger to the potential Verizon-AT&T oligopoly.Like T-Mobile, Sprint has been an aggressive and innovative competitor. Putting those two together in the currently proposed merger will unify and strengthen the competitive alternative to a Verizon-AT&T oligopoly, whereas the proposed AT&T-T-Mobile merger of seven years ago would have weakened it.The second flaw in the arguments of opponents to the merger is that rolling out 5G technology by the two smaller competitors will likely result in duplicated and redundant 5G capacity in densely-populated cities at the cost of rural and middle America.There are myriad areas in our country with dead spots and weak coverage areas. If T-Mobile and Sprint remain separate and capital-constrained, then basic business economics will dictate that they concentrate their available capital deployment in major cities.It is in the public interest to expand 5G technology to unserved and under-served areas.  That's much more likely if costly and unnecessary duplication in urban areas is minimized.When the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the Congress review the proposed merger, they should thoughtfully and thoroughly consider the long-term competitive impact, not only the immediate competitive impact.If they do, they should see that three strong competitors of roughly equal size will better serve the public interest. The proposed T-Mobile-Sprint merger is pro-competitive, not anti-competitive.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1588,A,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is flexing its muscles. After topping 69% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar.com last year with a 26.29% return, the $3.1 billion portfolio is outpacing 86% of its peers with a 15.33% gain this year going into June 21.It's also topping the S&P 500's modest 4.46% advance. The fund's strong performance this year has been fueled by holdings that include such leading growth stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU), TransUnion (TRU) and Five Below (FIVE).Gains this year by those stocks range from 30% by TransUnion to 104% by Netflix and 118% by Abiomed.Relative performance has ramped up for this growth fund this year as many holdings have posted solid financial results. ""The first quarter was particularly strong for us with many stocks reporting good earnings and an unusually low number of misses (in comparison to analysts' forecasts),"" co-manager Paul Gordon said.Solid stock picking has been another factor. The market tide is no longer rising, lifting all boats. ""Volatility in markets has picked up and correlations have dropped,"" Gordon said. ""There is more separation between winners and losers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmid tighter monetary conditions, investors have gravitated mainly into stocks posting the most attractive earnings gains, he adds.In addition, Gordon and his colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel aim to control risk. ""We construct the portfolio so no single sector, industry or security will be more than 500 or 600 basis points over or under our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Growth Index,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began its current stake in Abiomed in Q1. ""(It's) key driver is a heart pump called Impella, which is focused on an unserved part of the heart disease market,"" Gordon said. ""It has been extremely successful because it improves patient outcomes — fewer deaths, fewer re-hospitalizations — and lowers cost to the system.""Abiomed is only 10% penetrated in what they call their total addressable market, Gordon says. ""But that TAM could increase as they expand into other indications in the future,"" he added.Netflix's earnings per shares grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters. ""With 125 million paying subscriber base, there's a significant long-term runway for that number to go higher, based on the number of people in the world paying for TV and connected to the internet,"" Gordon said.Also, Netflix share price — which set all-time highs above 400 in June — got a boost when the company demonstrated pricing power in a series of price hikes. ""What the market really liked was that there was no significant change in the number of people who unplugged because of price increases,"" Gordon said.IBD'S TAKE: Keep your eye on Netflix by checking in to IBD's online page devoted to news and analysis focused on the content provider.Athletic apparel maker Lululemon's quarterly EPS growth has accelerated, growing 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% the past four stanzas. Share price is up more than 60% so far this year. Are there that many people taking up yoga? Or is the stock's jump due to an increasing number of people who want to wear stylist exercise garb even when they are nowhere near a yoga studio? Or is it a combination of the two?The stock's uptrend is a recovery from the slide that occurred from mid-2016 to mid-2017. Gordon attributes it to getting past quality and assortment problems that weighed on company performance.""After several years of operational issues that distracted the company, they've come out strong on the innovation side, both in women's and men's apparel,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began to buy TransUnion in November after deciding to exit Equifax (EFX) in the wake of its data breach scandal. ""We think there is a need for their (credit reporting) product,"" Gordon said. ""We think the Equifax issues were isolated and that it's possible TransUnion could gain market share as a result.""The MFS team likes TransUnion in its own right. ""We believe TransUnion could have above-industry growth from innovation in its core credit (business) that will make credit decisions more accurate and thereby drive pricing,"" Gordon said.He also says the company should benefit from further penetration into the health care, auto and insurance markets, and from greater exposure to emerging markets.Five Below's price discounts and focus on a teen market help insulate it from the problems dogging many brick-and-mortar retailers. ""They are more isolated from the Amazon (AMZN) threat,"" Gordon said. ""Like other dollar-store or off-price concepts, they offer a treasure hunt to their younger skewed demographic. It also has one of the longest runways for store growth in all of retail.""The chain now operates more than 400 stores, ""and long-term they believe they could operate over 2,000,"" Gordon said. ""It will take longer than five years at their current rate of growth.""The chain benefited last year from strong sales of Fidget Spinners. Five Below posted strong comparable sales in its latest quarter, surprising investors who expected a letdown after the Fidget Spinner fad. ""This showed that the company can comp impressively without the benefit of a hot trend,"" Gordon said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeMillennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A Millionaire

1590,A,"A new study on racial disparities in police conduct found that differences in offending by suspects — not racism — explains officers' responses.In the study ""Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force?"" professors from Michigan State and Arizona State universities analyzed officer-involved fatal shootings in 2015 and 2016.The report's abstract says:""We benchmark two years of fatal shooting data on 16 crime rate estimates. When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. ... Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.""Two recent studies found cops more reluctant to use deadly force against blacks, including one by a black Harvard economist. Professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. concluded: ""On the most extreme use of force — officer-involved shootings — we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.""But aren't blacks routinely ""racially profiled"" by cops? Not according to the Police-Public Contact Survey. Produced every three years by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the survey asks more than 60,000 people about their interactions with the police. It asks respondents' to provide age, race and gender. It asks them whether they had any contact with the police in the last year; what was the experience like; how were your treated; was there a use of force and so on.Turns out, according to a September 2017 National Review article, black men and white men are about equally likely to have a contact with a cop in a given year. As to multiple contacts, defined as three or more with the police in a given year, 1.5% of blacks vs. 1.2% of whites fall in that category. Not much difference.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere's also the National Crime Victimization Survey, which questions victims of crimes, whether or not the criminal was captured, as to the race and ethnicity of the suspect. It turns out that the race of the arrested matches the percentage given by victims. So unless victims are lying about the race of their assailant, unconcerned about whether he gets caught, blacks are not being ""overarrested.""A reasonable discussion about blacks and police practices cannot take place without acknowledging the disproportion amount of crime committed by blacks. According to the Department of Justice's ""Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 2009,"" in the country's 75 largest counties, blacks committed 62% of robberies, 45% of assaults and accounted for 57% of murder defendants.The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young white men is accidents, such as car accidents. The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide, usually committed by another young black man, not a cop. In 2016, according to the latest data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, 7,881 blacks were killed.The courageous Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, who writes extensively about police practice, asked:""Who is killing these black victims? Not whites, and not the police, but other blacks. In 2016, the police fatally shot 233 blacks, the vast majority armed and dangerous. ... Contrary to the Black Lives Matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police. In 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer.""In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, population approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, use-of-force incidents on the shifts that had cameras were half the rate of those without cameras. But something rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers with were down almost 90% from the prior year.It turns out when civilians knew they were being recorded, they — not the cops — behaved better and stop making false accusations. The use of force by cops also declined, but, again, not because the police changed their conduct. No, the cops continued performing as they'd been trained. Civilians, aware that they were being taped, were less confrontational and were more likely to cooperate and follow instructions. As a result, cops needed to use force less frequently.Still, when actor Jesse Williams gave a four-minute rant at the 2016 BETAwards about what he considered racist police practices, he claimed, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people every day.""Other columns by Larry ElderMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1592,A,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) is slated to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this consumer transaction technology provider will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, NCR has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all the occasions, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NCR has a Zacks Rank #3 and its Earnings ESP is +2.62%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents per share. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.74 billion.Factors to ConsiderThe company enriched its product portfolio during the quarter with the launch of a mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution called Ring Up by NCR Silver, whose payment processing is powered by Worldpay. This POS solution is targeted at U.S. based micro businesses. The company also launched a new “end-to-end mobile payment solution” in the month of October.Additionally, the company, in partnership with Samsung Electronics America, launched NCR Silver Quantum, “all-in-one point-of-sale (POS) commerce station featuring an integrated payment device with mobile wallet acceptance capability.”Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that its digital transformation platform will be enriched by “an 800-store chain customer”. Moreover, a prominent supermarket chain in Israel, named Bitan Wines Group, is looking to install NCR FastLane SelfServ Checkouts. Arizona based Tucson Federal Credit has implemented NCR’s Interactive Teller software for the betterment of customer experience at different branch locations.Furthermore, the company is also looking for growth opportunities via expansion of its channel program. Lastly, the company completed divestment of the remaining IPS assets to Turbon Group of Companies. We believe the completion of the transaction is a testament to the fact that NCR is focusing on growth in the software and services sector.However, we remain cautious about the weakness in the ATM business as large customers across North America, India, the Middle East and Africa delayed their spending.NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NCR Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, per our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.87% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

1596,A,"Amid widespread volatility, the Wall Street is back in the green territory for the year. The impressive run in the stocks last week has helped the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 index to attain this level. Meanwhile, gains for the Nasdaq Composite Index expanded, taking the lead this year, climbing 7.2%.Tech Sector BoostMost of the surge came from the technology stocks following the power-packed earnings. The market darlings, known as the FAAMNG group, which comprises Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) had slipped into deep correction territory in late March. However, these managed to bounce back and restore positive sentiments with better-than-expected results and optimism for future growth.Facebook shrugged off worries over the data-privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica that broke in mid-March, while Apple eased concerns over weak iPhone demand and greeted investors with a big capital return program plus Warren Buffett's increased stake in the firm. The fast-growing cloud computing business powered both Amazon and Microsoft’s growth story. Notably, Microsoft seems on track to record its strongest annual revenue growth for more than a decade. Netflix came up with blockbuster results while Alphabet’s numbers were also inspiring.Apart from these, semiconductor firms like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC and payment companies including Visa V and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) also fueled the rally and instilled confidence in the sector.Energy JumpsOil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production. The rally in the commodity has lent major optimism to the energy sector, pushing many stocks to new highs.Other FactorsStronger-than-expected earnings are providing the biggest catalyst. Total Q1 earnings for the 444 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far are up 24.5% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates. Notably, the Q1 earnings season is on track to record its best quarter in seven years.Additionally, signs of easing trade worries between China and the United States as well as April inflation data raised the appeal for riskier assets lately. This is because soft inflation numbers have alleviated the month-long aggressive rake hikes concern.Given the improving macro backdrop, many stocks have been surging. Below, we have highlighted those five stocks that have been leading the way higher this year and are poised to continue their bullish trend given that these have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR  -  Free Report) – Up 784.7%This California-based audio technology company designs audio products for consumer, commercial and healthcare markets.

1605,A,"Nielsen Holdings Plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 18.67%.Last quarter, Nielsen reported earnings of 52 cents per share, which excluded a provisional non-cash tax charge of 29 cents per share. The figure increased 18.2% year over year and 26.8% sequentially.Revenues increased 6.3% year over year and 7.3% sequentially to $1.76 billion. Top-line growth was driven by contribution from the acquisition of Gracenote, continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and growth in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. Buy segment.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Robust Product Portfolio to Boost ResultsNielsen’s regular investments in innovative technologies bode well for its product portfolio expansion.Recently, Nielsen launched Advanced Audience Forecasting tool which provides forecasts of TV audiences defined by advanced audience segments to its clients.Further, the company introduced Connected Partner Program, which helps companies to connect their network, discover new connected partners and utilize the measurement data provided by Nielsen.Also, the company launched Nielsen Branded Integration Intel, which provides standardized measurement of brands appearing within video content, including TV programs.These endeavors are likely to benefit the company’s first-quarter results.Strategic Partnerships Remain PositiveStrategic partnerships have been shaping Nielsen’s growth trajectory over the past few years.Recently, Nielsen extended its partnership with Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), post which, the latter will increase the use of Nielsen's insights and solutions. This is likely to benefit the Buy segment of the company which did not perform well in the last quarter.However, the segment is expected to witness sluggish growth in the first quarter due to weakness in the U.S. market.Earlier this year, Nielsen entered into a multi-year renewal agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI  -  Free Report). This partnership will allow the Sinclair Broadcast to deploy Nielsen TV ratings in its business model.Last year, the company also signed an agreement with Cumulus Media, post which Nielsen has started providing radio and network radio ratings services to 446 radio stations across 90 local markets.These partnerships will continue to aid the strong performance of Watch segment of the company.We believe the above-mentioned moves taken by the company will boost its top-line growth by improving its clientele in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise | Nielsen Holdings Plc QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1615,A,"On May 16, we issued an updated research report on Agilent Technologies (A  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Growth DriversTechnology firm, Agilent’s top-line growth is benefiting from expanding product portfolio, end-market strength, and robust performance in China and Europe.Agilent’s strong business portfolio serves as another growth driver. The company has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. Generally, the launch of new platforms and acceptance of new standards indicate significant testing opportunity. Moreover, Agilent’s leadership position ensures top-line growth.Since the past few years, strategic acquisitions have been playing an important role in shaping Agilent’s growth trajectory. The buyouts of Genohm (May 2018), Lasergen (April 2018), Advanced Analytical Technologies (March 2018), Multiplicom NV (January 2017), Cobalt Light Systems (July 2017), Seahorse Bioscience and iLab Solutions (2016) have expanded its product portfolio. All these buyouts have strengthened Agilent’s portfolio and increased focus on the segments with higher growth potential.Also, Agilent has entered into a number of strategic partnerships, helping it to expand its top-line growth. Last month, the company collaborated with BioTek Instruments to develop a new integrated solution that combines cellular metabolic analysis with imaging technologies. The solution will enhance the assay workflow and normalize XF measurements. Agilent has also collaborated with many companies in the field of companion diagnostics. Currently, the healthcare sector is undergoing a revolution and companion diagnostics or personalized medicine is taking the center stage as it can improve patient care and better manage healthcare costs by administering the most appropriate treatment to individuals.Moreover, Agilent’s expansion in China is a big positive. Agilent makes test equipment that is required by manufacturers. Therefore, the company’s strong market position and customer relationships in China are long-term drivers of the business. Chinese stimulus plans have fueled growth in the past, and laws passed by the Chinese government regarding food safety and environmental testing offer additional growth opportunities for Agilent.Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteHeadwindsPrice Performance: Agilent underperformed its industry in the past year. Shares of the company have declined 10.9% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 17%.Agilent’s operating margin remains challenged. While expenses appear to be mainly focused on the SG&A side, R&D is also on the rise. Moreover, the increase has been so significant that margins did not show any noticeable increment despite strong growth in all the reporting segments.Furthermore, though acquisitions are part of Agilent’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition are likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are Littelfuse, Inc. (LFUS  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and SMC Corporation (SMCAY  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Additionally, regular investment in research and development and capital deployment in strategic acquisitions will continue to benefit the company’s product portfolio, which is likely to aid AMETEK’s performance in both segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electronic Instruments Group’s (“EIG”) first-quarter revenues is pegged at $691 million. The consensus estimate for Electromechanical Group (“EMG”) stands at $422 million.AMETEK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AMETEK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AMETEK, Inc.

1626,A,"Badger Meter, Inc. (BMI  -  Free Report) has been experiencing growing demand for its E-Series meters and ORION cellular endpoints. Also, focus on acquisitions, rebound in the Flow Instrumentation business and benefits of the U.S. tax reform are other vital growth drivers for the company. On the other hand, elevated expenses and rising copper costs remain concerns.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a market capitalization of around $1.3 billion. The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15.3%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and likely headwinds.Factors Favoring Badger MeterPositive Earnings Surprise HistoryBadger Meter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 1.02%.Positive Estimate Revisions, Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 has been revised nearly 23% and 21% upward, respectively, over the past 90 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings is pegged at $1.60, reflecting estimated year-over-year growth of 34%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings is pegged at $1.76, indicating estimated year-over-year increase of 10%.Price PerformanceThe company has outperformed the industry in the last year. Its shares have rallied 30.6%, while the industry recorded growth of 24.5%.Return on Assets (ROA)Badger Meter currently has a ROA of 9.2%, while the industry's ROA is 8.2%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Growth Drivers in PlaceBadger Meter is well poised to gain from the growing demand for E-Series meters and ORION cellular endpoints, as well as BEACON Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) managed solution in the near future. The company will also benefit from the integration of the D-Flow technology into E-series meters. Further, introduction of the next version of E-series meters in the second half of 2018 will stoke Badger Meter’s growth in the form of product improvement and cost reduction.Notably, Badger Meter recently agreed to acquire Innovative Metering Solutions. This buyout will help the company serve its utility customers in the Southeastern United States. In addition, the acquisition of D-Flow in 2017 will help Badger Meter enhance its successful E-Series Ultrasonic product line, lower production costs and provide a platform for further advancement of ultrasonic capabilities. It also bought the assets of Carolina Meter & Supply in November last year. The buyout will help boost the company’s sales, as well as technical and operational support to its customers.In addition to the above, Badger Meter will benefit from significant rebound in the Flow Instrumentation business, driven by continued improvement in the oil and gas markets, as well as the impact of sales channel reorganizations. Furthermore, its distribution agreement with DNOW L.P. for global sales into the oil and gas industry will likely prove conducive to long-term growth.Finally, Badger Meter expects the tax reform to be highly beneficial for the company over the long term. It believes the tax legislation will have a positive impact on its bottom-line growth this year. The company anticipates that the effective tax rate will drop to around 24% in 2018, from the normal range of 35-36%.HeadwindsRecently, Badger Meter announced its intention to terminate the company’s frozen pension-benefit plan. For that, it will incur a one-time charge currently estimated around $5 million in 2018, which might affect earnings. Additionally, escalating copper costs are expected to drag down Badger Meter’s margins.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Allied Motion Technologies, Inc.

1627,A,"Semtech Corporation’s (SMTC  -  Free Report) shares hit a new 52-week high of $43.35 on Apr 10, closing a shade lower at $42.80. Barring minor hiccups, Semtech’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend. The stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 5%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.08%.Over the last year, the company’s shares have gained 30.9%, outperforming its industry’s 16.3% rally.Key FactorsSemtech is currently riding on differentiated growth drivers and diversification strategy. Key growth drivers for Semtech are product differentiation, operational flexibility, and specific focus on fast-growing segments and regions.We believe that the company’s new design wins, product launches and perfect execution will take it from strength to strength.The price appreciation can be attributed to the company’s strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. In the fiscal fourth quarter, results of which were reported on Mar 14, earnings of 42 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Semtech’s revenues of $140.6 million increased year over year. The increase was driven by a strong demand, reinforcing the company’s enterprise computing end market.The company’s unrivalled market position, compelling product lines, strong revenue growth, continued innovation and strong long-term growth potential consolidate its market presence favorably.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, management expects revenues in the range of $147-$153 million. This implies 7% sequential increase at the mid-point of the guided range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $150.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of 45-47 cents. This implies a 10% sequential increase at the mid-point of the guided range.

Los Angeles is the latest addition to the list of countries receiving this service.The service will likely offer food items like dairy, meat and seafood. In addition, the online giant now allows shoppers to order alcohol, including the delivery of beer, wine and spirits, thereby bolstering its food offerings.Undoubtedly, the new destination will help the company attract more customers to its Amazon Prime program, which is a significant revenue source.Following the news, Amazon’s share price was up 2.14%. Also, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company’s shares have gained 59.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 43.3%.Amazon’sTwo-Hour Whole Foods DeliveryThis February, Amazon rolled out the two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. Currently, this service is available in seven countries and will continue to expand across the United States.The company pulls items from Whole Foods stores, bags them but gets the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, the delivery is absolutely free and within twohours. Customers in these cities can order Whole Foods groceries through Amazon’s Prime Now app or website between 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. The items include fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other necessities that the local Whole Foods stores stock.The two-hour free delivery service has been introduced keeping in mind customers’ demands. Consumers look for convenience and good bargains, and Amazon is focusing on both. Per a Walker Sands survey, 40% consumers would buy groceries online if they were less expensive and 23% would opt for it if it were more convenient.The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. The deal was certainly a strategic move by Amazon as it immediately gave the latter an access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree and Dollar General.Bottom LineAmazon has been making efforts to bump up its delivery system. From a span of a day to two hours, two hours to 15 minutes, and 15 minutes to two minutes, Amazon has been cutting down on its delivery time for Prime members.Apart from this, Amazon Prime members already enjoy free two-day and one-day deliveries. Also, Amazon Restaurants offer one-hour delivery for Prime members from popular restaurants.

1630,A,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 1.The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.31%.In the last reported quarter, Seagate delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.71%. Earnings of $1.48 per share surged 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues came in at $2.91 billion, up 0.7% year over year. The improvement in both top and bottom line figures was driven by strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.36 per share and that for revenues is $2.76 billion.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to considerNotably, shares of Seagate have returned 40.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Seagate is currently riding on advancement of cloud storage technologies in the industry, exponential growth in stored data, Nearline’s rapid adoption, stable hard disk drives (HDD) pricing environment and low inventory levels. We believe this will drive the results in the soon-to-be reported quarter for Seagate.Further, growing HDD requirement due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions remains positive for the company. Also, PC market stabilization will aid the shipments of the company in the third quarter.The company expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Strong Product Portfolio — Key CatalystSeagate’s continuous efforts on product innovation and expansion will continue to cater to the rising demand for memory drives in the going-to-be reported quarter.Recently, the company rolled out 14TB helium-based Exos X14 enterprise drive which ensures cost-efficient management of growing volume of data. The product bodes well for the rising demand for enterprise storage capacity, cloud storage and hyperscale environments.The company also launched Seagate Joy Drive in collaboration with JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) in the beginning of this year. The device allows android and tablet users to expand their storage and battery capacity.Earlier this year, Seagate partnered with RackTop Systems to create data security solutions to meet risk management standards. This is likely to boost the adoption rate of the company’s solutions.Further, the recently launched¬ 5U84 high-density enclosure, Seagate Fast SSD and LaCie Rugged Secure will continue to improve customer base of the company with their efficient and useful capacity storage features.Additionally, Seagate’s long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive portfolio.Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1635,A,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Agilent Technologies is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for A in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 59 cents per share for A, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for A, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.21% heading into earnings season.Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1636,A,"Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 on Feb 14.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 12.20%.Last quarter, Agilent delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.35%. Earnings of 67 cents increased 13.6% sequentially as well as year over year.Revenues increased 8% sequentially and 7% year over year to $1.19 billion. Top line growth was driven by strength across all product lines, particularly in Europe and Americas.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, Agilent expects revenues in the range of $1.145-1.165 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected between 55 cents and 57 cents per share.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Expanding Product PortfolioAgilent Technologies has shifted its focus to life sciences, genomics, diagnostics and wireless test markets, in which it has made a few important acquisitions and alliances.Broad-based growth in all product lines is the driver for Agilent. We believe that the company’s continuous effort on expanding product portfolio and strategic acquisitions is likely to drive results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.In the first quarter fiscal 2018, Agilent completed the acquisition of Luxcel Biosciences, which expands its cell analysis portfolio. This acquisition brings in assay kits that are easy to use and compatible with industry-standard plate-readers. Hence, the deal is likely to benefit Agilent’s position in the pharmaceutical industry.Further, the integration of U.K.-based Cobalt Light Systems will strengthen Agilent’s position in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market.Segment Estimates PositiveLife Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) revenues are expected to increase, driven by growing chemical, energy, pharma and food end markets. Revenues from this segment, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, are currently pegged at $578 million.The consensus estimate for revenues for the Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) stands at $401 million.Moreover, Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is likely to benefit from increasing demand for medical services and products.

1637,A,"QuickLogic Corporation (QUIK  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14. Notably, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.2%.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 6 cents per share.Revenues of $3 million increased 6% on a year-over-year basis and also met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, Samsung accounted for 24% of total revenues compared with 21% during the previous quarter.Guidance & EstimatesManagement lowered guidance for fourth-quarter 2017, primarily due to Display Bridge customers trimming the fourth-quarter forecast by around $450,000 and the delay in placing order for a new wearable design by the company’s tier one smartphone customer.Additionally, its focus on the currently licensed technology running at high volume instead of expansion of the license agreement with an existing fab partner hurt the company’s revenues in the third quarter. The trend is anticipated to continue in the fourth quarter as well.For fourth-quarter 2017, management projects revenues of approximately $3 million (+/- 10%). New product revenues are forecast to be almost $1.2 million, while mature product revenues are projected to be $1.8 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues is currently pegged at $3 million.At the mid-point of guidance, non-GAAP loss is expected to be approximately $3.3 million or 4 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings is currently pegged at a loss of 4 cents.QuickLogic stock has gained 18.4% year over year, outperforming the 8.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGrowing adoption of QuikLogic’s sensor processing solutions and embedded FPGA (eFPGA) Intellectual Property (IP) Licensing is a tailwind. The company’s new support center in Taiwan related to eFPGA IP has also helped in developing relationships with prospective customers, which can eventually lead to design wins.During the quarter, the company’s test-chip qualification for SMIC low power 40 nanometer process was completed. In order to expand presence in the Chinese market, QuickLogic signed a partnership agreement with a prominent EDA tool and semiconductor IP distributor in China named AcconSys. The latter will provide the company’s flagship ArcticPro embedded FPGA solutions with sales and support services in China. The deal is expected to act as a catalyst.Notably, QuickLogic was granted a patent for Flexible Fusion Engine (“FFE”), which is used for always-on sensor processing in the EOS S3 multi-core processor, by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The company’s sensor processing segment has seen rapid growth driven by its EOS S3 software on a chip (SoC), which has the capability to support always-on/always listening requirement at a very low power consumption level.As the world is moving toward voice interfaces like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Alphabet’s OK Google, the need for technology products that run on voice command is also increasing. This is leading to growing demand for this always-on feature in the mobile, wearable, hearable and battery powered IoT products industries.This new feature is replacing the previously prevalent push-to-talk feature. The hardware architecture used for the push-to-talk feature is not considered apt for the always-on feature as it will consume more battery life. Consequently, QuickLogic’s low power consuming EOS S3 SoC with an integrated Low Power Sound Detector or LPSD is gaining wide acceptance in this scenario.The company is witnessing increasing demand for wearable products in the B2B market, primarily driven by higher demand from hospitals and fitness focused companies, which need to track body activities and biometric information.The smartphone market also raises optimism. It is currently working with a Japanese smartphone OEM, which is expected to adopt QuickLogic’s EOS S3 SoC for its new models scheduled to be launched in 2018.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1638,A,"GrubHub Inc. (GRUB  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Last quarter, earnings of 28 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 21.7% year over year. The company has a mixed record of earning surprises in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.33%.Revenues of $163 million beat the consensus mark of $159 million and improved 32% from the year-ago period.Notably, shares of GrubHub have gained 68.3% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 45.7% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGrubHub diverse restaurant base, broader marketing reach and continuous improvement in products are helping it gain new diners. This was evident in the third quarter as Active Diners increased 28% year over year to 9.81 million. Management stated that this was the highest rate of organic diner growth in the last 1.5 years.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Active Diners is pegged at 11.9 million, indicating a 45.1% increase from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.GrubHub’s expansion outside the Tier 1 market is a positive. The company’s restaurant network has expanded 60% in the last 12 months (as of the end of third-quarter 2017), with significant growth coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. GrubHub’s delivery is available in around 80 markets in more than 800 cities.We believe that GrubHub’s partnerships with the likes of Groupon, Yelp (YELP  -  Free Report) and The Cheesecake Factory will continue to drive the customer base. GrubHub’s recently completed acquisitions of Eat24, OrderUp and Boston-based Foodler have broadened its portfolio of restaurants.The addition of Eat24 strengthens the company’s position across Tier 1 markets and almost doubles business in a large number of Tier 2 markets. Management stated the acquisition helped it gain new customers in markets like Miami, San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas, Dallas and Houston.We anticipate the aforementioned factors to have aided the company in attracting diners to try GrubHub services in the fourth quarter, thereby contributing to revenues.However, increasing expenses might keep margins under pressure.GrubHub Inc.

1639,A,"Agilent Technologies (A  -  Free Report)) is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. The company’s portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential is a big positive. The company also enjoys a robust presence in the health care market.A few recent developments bode well for the company’s growth.One such development is the FDA’s approval for a cancer diagnostic, PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx. The test will be used in cases of urothelial carcinoma (“UC”) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”).The PDL1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test has already been approved for melanoma as well as non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). It has now been approved for UC and SCCHN patients too. The test enables physicians in the United States to identify UC and SCCHN patients, who still have disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and are most likely to benefit from treatment with Opdivo.We are encouraged by the company’s efforts to develop new assays for cancer treatment.The new assay will help Agilent to cash in on the fast-growing health care cancer-diagnostics segment.Also, Agilent has an impressive record of returning cash to its shareholders through share buybacks and regular dividend payouts. In the fiscal third quarter, Agilent did not repurchase any share but paid out $42 million as dividends.Moreover, the recently acquired Cobalt Light Systems will allow Agilent to strengthen its presence in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market.

1641,A,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. Investors are keenly awaiting the earnings report of this technology-based outsourcing solutions provider to the financial services industry  to see if it succeeds in delivering a positive surprise.Notably, Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and matched the same once, delivering an average positive surprise of 12.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Broadridge has a Zacks Rank #2 and its Earnings ESP is +1.45%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share. This indicates a year-over-year increase of 48.7%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $953.7 million, indicating 6.9% growth from the year-ago quarter actual figure.Factors to ConsiderNotably, the company continues to supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, the company acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, a provider of financial document management solutions. The acquisition is anticipated to enrich the company’s offerings related to “corporate disclosure lifecycle”.     Additionally, the company also acquired Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Moreover, in a bid to offer an innovative digital experience across financial services and other industries, the company expanded its strategic alliance with Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) in December 2017. The collaboration effort will help to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository.Furthermore, the company enhanced its client base with some prominent additions in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Earthport, a financial services firm, adopted “Broadridge's hosted service for Foreign Exchange and Cash Management processing”.    Beta Capital Wealth Management chose the company’s solutions for a “comprehensive front to back office technology and operations solution.”Broadridge also completed a blockchain-based pilot project along with Natixis and Societe Generale aimed at optimizing the efficiency of “bilateral repurchase, or repo agreements.”We believe all these initiatives and the strong business model of the company, a good percentage of which comes from recurring revenues are tailwinds that will help the company to deliver an impressive performance in the quarter under discussion.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

1646,A,"Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) has claimed that its former employees who formed Shanghai Echrom Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., have adopted a not-so-honest way of getting information to replicate an Agilent gas chromatograph.The leading provider of application focused solutions sued Shanghai Echrom and a number of its former employees alleging intellectual property theft. The suit seeks a ban on the use of Agilent’s proprietary technologies and compensation for its losses.The company’s senior vice president and general counsel Michael Tang stated, “Agilent is determined to protect our IP, and will take all appropriate legal actions against any infringements worldwide.”We observe that Agilent shares have rallied 37.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.6%.IP and its Protection MatterIntellectual property (IP) rights and their protection (by law) encourage a company toward better production and commitment to additional resources and enhances consumer confidence against counterfeits. These hold the key to the survival of multibillion dollar firms and give them ways to legally fight competition.This is all the more important for Agilent as it faces fierce competition from the likes of Veeco Instruments (VECO  -  Free Report), Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report).Agilent Technologies, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Agilent Technologies, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteBut the Truth is BitterAt the end of the day, employees do like to switch jobs because it’s more profitable and allows them liberties that aren’t available for sticking around at a big corporate house like Agilent.In the process, IP also changes hand (illegally). There have been instances of employees leaving companies, forming new ones and getting sued over intellectual property infringement in the past and it may happen in the future too.So, while Agilent could win this battle, the war will go on.Agilent has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1650,A,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is further expanding its cloud presence beyond its stronghold, China, quite aggressively.In its latest step toward international expansion, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, has partnered with Istanbul-based B2B services provider e-Glober, to offer its cloud services in Turkey.e-Glober is Turkey’s sole authorized agent and already a business partner of global wholesale platform Alibaba.com.Alibaba has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past year. The company's shares have gained 52.1%, outperforming its industry’s growth of 41.5%. We expect international expansion to back the momentum going forward.DetailsPer this partnership, e-Glober will deliver Alibaba Cloud’s suite of services to various companies ranging from startups to medium-sized businesses. Alibaba’s cloud services will include elastic computing, database services, networking, security and middleware services to its clients in Turkey.The deal will help the businesses in the country to reduce their infrastructure costs and shorten the time period for their goods to reach the market. This will allow the Turkish companies to expand their geographic reach and better compete in the global trade.In return, Alibaba will get an access to e-Glober’s huge existing business customer base that consists of several exporters, small and medium-sized businesses, and other local companies in the online retail, multimedia and gaming sectors. It will give Alibaba a competitive edge against its rivals and further expand market share in the growing cloud market.Yeming Wang, deputy general manager of Alibaba Cloud Global, said, “We aim to become the preferred cloud service provider for all sizes of business in Turkey by providing a full range of cloud solutions and combining this with E-Glober’s local expertise.”Why This Move?Cloud still remains an expanding market with high growth prospects. In a recent report, Gartner projected the public cloud market to reach $411.4 billion by 2020. We believe that Alibaba, with its ongoing initiatives, is well poised to grab the growth opportunity.Moreover, Turkey has been witnessing a strong demand for cloud-based services. There has been a rise in the adoption of cloud computing in the country.According to a research firm IDC, Turkey’s public cloud market was valued at US$96.93 million last year, ahead of other major markets in the region such as the United Arab Emirates ($82.56 million) and Saudi Arabia ($69.22 million).Hence, Alibaba’s decision to expand here in this country is the right move.Summing UpAs Alibaba focuses on international expansion, its efforts are directed worldwide including South East Asia, Europe, Middle East and the United States.In specific terms, Alibaba has expanded overseas to Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia, Frankfurt, London and Paris in Europe, New York and San Mateo in the United States, Dubai in the Middle East, as well as Seoul, Tokyo and Sydney. It currently has more than 2.3 million customers worldwide.In the last reported fiscal third quarter, the company’s cloud computing business segment reported revenues of RMB3.6 billion, up 104% year over year. The increase was driven by a rise in the number of paying customers and higher-than-usual spending by them, reflecting increased usage of services.Given the growing position of Alibaba’s cloud business in China and aggressive international expansion strategies, we believe that cloud computing will be one of its major growth drivers in the long run.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus  Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderAlibaba has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1651,A,"On Apr 6, we issued an updated research report on technology firm, AMETEK Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AMETEK is a leading worldwide manufacturer of electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. The company sells its products globally through two major operating groups — the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). Growth DriversPrice Performance: AMETEK has outperformed its industry in the past year. Shares of the company have gained 34.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 26.2% in the same time period. AMETEK’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand and market share gains. The company continues to reap benefits from the execution of its four core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, investments in product development and strategic acquisitions.Also, the diversification in end markets like aerospace, defense, medical, automation and other industrial markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle, has enabled the company post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive toward geographic and market diversification has further helped AMETEK expand its customer base.Moreover, the company’s strong business portfolio serves as another growth driver. In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. New products introduced over the last three years comprised 24% of revenues. This indicates that the company is not only good at developing products but also at marketing them.Despite the uncertainties prevailing in the global economy, AMETEK has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronic appliances and electromechanical devices enables the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market. It also expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance in the future.For the first quarter of 2018, AMETEK expects sales to be up low-double digits year over year. Earnings are expected in the range of 70-72 cents per share, up 17-20% from the prior-year quarter.For 2018, AMETEK expects sales to increase approximately 7-9%, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and 3-5% organic sales growth. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.95-$3.05 per share, up 13-17% year over year.HeadwindsA major portion of AMETEK’s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. Also, significant dollar strength and adverse foreign currency fluctuations erode the profitability of the company.Furthermore, though acquisitions are part of AMETEK’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition are likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance.AMETEK, Inc.

Moreover, increasing net new subscriptions for CC will continue to benefit Adobe.Additionally, the company is experiencing growing adoption of Acrobat and Adobe Sign, which is continuously contributing to the strong performance of Document Cloud (“DC”).For the to-be-reported quarter, Adobe projects total revenues of $2.15 billion, in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1658,A,"Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 15. Last quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWaste Management is executing well its initiatives to refocus on the core business activities and instill price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. The company aims to focus on improving customer retention by providing better service and higher value solutions.Since its acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal in 2015, the company has extended its geographical footprint and emerged with a stronger financial profile. Waste Management has also acquired Keep It Clean, a local disposal firm, during the quarter. The company’s steady stream of accretive acquisitions is likely to drive earnings. It has also reported better-than-expected revenues in the trailing six quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Waste Management’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,565 million, slightly higher than reported revenues of $3,460 million in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company's successful cost-reduction initiatives have helped it in accomplishing remarkable gross margin expansion and EBITDA growth over the quarters. It is undertaking several steps to further boost its margins, which are likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company expects volumes to be down due to lower national counts as it strives for improved margin growth and pricing. The pricing environment also remains challenging and highly competitive due to aggressive bidding by smaller competitors. Waste Management needs to improve margins on the recycling side through adjustment of rebates to reflect lower pricing and also needs to improve the quality of inbound material to increase profitability. Decline in average recycling commodity prices and recycling volumes also remain headwinds.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waste Management is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1659,A,"Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 14. Adjusted earnings of the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents last quarter. Waste Connections delivered a healthy average positive surprise of 4.8% in the trailing four quarters, beating earnings estimates in each.Let’s see what’s in store in the company’s upcoming results.Key Factors to ConsiderSince the completion of its merger with Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd at the end of second-quarter 2016, Waste Connections has emerged as an industry leader with enhanced scale and a stronger financial profile. With complementary footprint, the combined company has pro forma revenues of approximately $4.1 billion and operates an integrated network of solid waste operations across North America. In fact, post-merger, the company has reported better-than-expected revenues in each quarter, to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Waste Connections’ fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1,125 million, slightly higher than reported revenues of $1,049 million in the prior-year quarter. The combined company has benefited from a diverse revenue base and has strategic assets uniquely positioned for growth.Waste Connections typically targets secondary and rural markets to garner a higher local market share, which would be difficult to attain in more competitive urban markets. With prime location of disposal sites within competitive markets, Waste Connections has optimal asset positioning to generate higher profitability. Given the importance of and costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream offer a competitive advantage and serve as a barrier to entry.However, Waste Connections’ revenues are highly seasonal due to lower volume of solid waste generated during winter and early spring owing to comparatively lesser construction and demolition activities and reduced E&P activity. Severe cold weather conditions further reduce waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. The seasonality is also attributable to lower drilling programs and lower volumes of E&P waste during mild winter conditions. All these seasonal factors lower predictably in revenue generation and increase operating risks.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waste Connections is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1660,A,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 15. Last quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 1.5%, beating estimates on each occasion.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterMarketing and media budgets usually have a positive correlation with the economy. Consequently, media spending is currently trending up buoyed by reduced corporate taxes that have led to higher client spends and advertising budgets. Moreover, there has been a marked shift in the recent years as media consumption patterns have evolved from traditional to digital media.Omnicom is likely to witness healthy performance in developed markets like the United States and developing markets like Asia. The company is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. It is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs are likely to boost earnings.However, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. In the present scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, the company is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs, which thereby could affect its bottom line.Moreover, as the company expands its international operations, it highly exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. The company also faces huge concentration risk as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,206 million compared with revenues of $4,242 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +0.05%.

1663,A,"Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before market open.Over the last month, the company’s shares yielded a return of 5.7%, outperforming 4.9% growth recorded by the industry.In fact, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 7.90% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayAmphenol Corporation believes its state-of-the-art technologies, efficient management workforce and diversified business expose will likely help boost the company’s top-line performance in the upcoming quarters. Notably, strategic sensor-business buyouts from Meggitt PLC (June 2017), Intelligente Sensorsysteme acquisition (June 2017) and Telect Incorporated buyout (July 2017) are anticipated to bolster the company’s revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, solid mobile devices, commercial air market and automotive market sales are projected to aid the company’s revenue growth trajectory, going forward.Amphenol Corporation anticipates to report revenues in the range of $1.70-$1.74 billion in third-quarter 2017 (estimating an year-over-year increment of 4-6%).Furthermore, elevated revenues, a lean and highly flexible cost structure, and greater operational efficacy are estimated to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarters. Notably, Amphenol Corporation projects to report earnings in the range of 77-79 cents per share in the third quarter.However, Amphenol Corporation believes lower military market sales, and slightly lower IT and data communications sales might hurt the company’s top-line results.We believe rising average debt levels, if not checked, might further escalate the company’s interest expense going forward. In addition, sudden input price inflation, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact or any supply chain challenge might dent the company’s near-term results.Amphenol Corporation currently carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) is predicted to be up 10.2% in the next three to five years. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is currently pegged at 79 cents per share for third-quarter 2017.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

This segment comprises around 69% of the company’s product revenues, displaying 14% year over year growth.The company is positive about catering to the exponential rate of data growth with its cloud-integrated all-flash solutions that fit well with hybrid cloud infrastructure. During the second quarter, the company’s all-flash array business surged 60% on a year-over-year basis. Its annualized net revenue run rate was $1.7 billion.The company’s expertise in the flash array market is aiding its popularity in storage area network (SAN) and converged infrastructure markets. The company’s launch of hyper-converged infrastructure is also anticipated to be a positive for the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, NetApp’s extended partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in the second quarter for the development of the industry’s first cloud-based enterprise Network File System (NFS) to be delivered via Azure is anticipated to bolster the top line.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hardware Maintenance and Other Services revenues is pegged at $374 million.

1665,A,"Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 152.50%.However, in the last reported quarter, the top and the bottom lines declined 4.2% and 23%, respectively on a year-over-year basis. Notably, both the figures have been showing a declining trend over the last few quarters, which is a concern.Sluggish user growth coupled and declining revenues remain headwinds. However, the company’s focus on boosting user growth rate and engagement levels is a positive.Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 40.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 25.6% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLackluster user growth remains the primary concern for investors. In third-quarter 2017, Twitter reported adjusted monthly average users (MAUs) of 330 million, up 1.2% sequentially and 4% on a year-over-year basis.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MAUs is pegged at 332 million, indicating a 0.6% sequential increase and 4% increase from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that Twitter has been taking a lot of initiatives to combat all odds including curbing the widespread bullying on its platform. The company rolled out a 280-character limit for tweets earlier in November, doubling it from the legacy 140 limit.It also took various other measures to make tweeting easier and more expressive for people, and to keep the platform clear of malpractices.Twitter’s focus on improving the live video feature is expected to drive user engagement. The company streamed 830 live events in the last quarter and secured 30 new live partnerships.Moreover, Twitter’s revenues are highly dependent on the international market. In the last reported quarter, the company earned nearly 43.7% of its revenues from international markets. International revenues increased 6% year over year in the third quarter while U.S. revenues decreased 11%.Therefore, the company’s launch of Twitter Lite application on Android devices in 24 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America is prudent in our view.However, with such a small user base, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which has around 2.13 billion MAUs. Given such a huge user base, advertisers are more likely to opt for it as it presents a much larger canvas for them. The social media giant reported its quarterly earnings recently, wherein its Advertising revenues soared 48.1% year over year to $12.78 billion.Though Twitter’s ad engagements continue to grow, it is the cost per ad engagement metric that remains an area of concern. It was down 54% in the third quarter of 2017, given the shift to auto-play video, which has lower cost per view compared to click-to-play.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Twitter’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $690 million while ad revenues are expected to be around $592 million, representing a respective decline of 3.8% and 7.2% from the figures reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.Twitter, Inc.

1669,A,"VWR Corporation  announced opening of a new kitting center in Skalice, Czech Republic on the eve of the company to be taken over by Avantor. Per VWR, this new 35,000 square foot facility is strategically located and will be helpful for the company’s business in the high-prospect EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region.Notably, this new center will particularly help expand Therapak’s (acquired by VWR in 2016) existing footprint in Europe with advanced facility and comprehensive kitting services for regional as well as global customers.Location wise, this new center will assist the company’s VWRCATALYST offering to grow. This apart, proximity of this site to major industrial freight carrier hubs will enhance service levels compared with VWR’s current model. The facility will be fully operational on Oct 2, 2017.Notably, VWRCATALYST Clinical and Biorepository Services lend a complete solution to its global regulated research and product development clients in the pharma, biopharma, manufacturing and clinical trial industries. Earlier in 2017, VWRCATALYST acquired laboratory and medical equipment, plus the ancillary supplier MESM and an international biorepository services organization, EPL Archives.In this regard we note that over the last couple of years, VWR’s EMEA-APAC (Asia Pacific) segment has been experiencing an increase in comparable net sales, backed by several strategic initiatives implemented in recent times. This includes  a series  of  plans  to  significantly  upgrade  its information  technology  infrastructure,  optimize  distribution network  and  modify  marketing schemes.In the recently-reported second quarter, on an organic basis, net sales in EMEA-APAC improved 2.7%. Going forward, management expects the EMEA-APAC segment to continue its run of strong historical progress.However, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. In general, VWR competes with players like Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1670,A,"Agilent Technologies (A  -  Free Report) recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a cancer diagnostic, named PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx. The test will be used in cases of urothelial carcinoma (“UC”) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”).This is a new step in the company's efforts to expand in the growing cancer-diagnostic market.The PDL1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test has already been approved for melanoma as well as non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). Now, it has been approved for UC and SCCHN patients too. The test enables physicians in the United States to identify UC and SCCHN patients, who still have disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and are most likely to benefit from treatment with Opdivo.Opdivo is an immunotherapy developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx was developed in collaboration with Opdivo maker, BMS. Currently, this test has a lot more utility than any other PD-L1 assay in the U.S. market.Agilent's Role in HealthcareCurrently, the healthcare sector is witnessing a revolution. Personalized medicine is taking the center stage as it could provide improved patient care and better manage costs by administering the most appropriate treatment to individuals. It has been found that not all treatments are suitable for those suffering from a specific disease as some require more specialized tests.The advancements could have far-reaching effects on the entire healthcare system as personalized medicines considerably improve patient care while reducing medical bills.Agilent has signed several collaborative agreements with pharma and biotech companies including Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Bristol-MyersSquibb, Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report), Amgen and Eli Lilly to develop diagnostics using both immunohistochemical and genomic-based technologies for the better treatment of cancer.Bottom LineAgilent is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. We remain positive on Agilent's broad-based portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential. Further, the company continues to introduce high-margin products.According to a report from marketsandmarkets.com, the worldwide cancer diagnostics market may reach $13.1 billion by 2020 from $7.1 billion by 2015, driven by several technological advancements in diagnostic platforms. Moreover, the market has seen the advent of hybrid imaging instruments with enhanced accuracy, such as PET/CT and SPECT/CT. These advancements have taken the cancer-diagnostics market to new heights.We believe the new assay will help Agilent to cash in on the fast-growing healthcare cancer-diagnostics segment.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

Also, non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected in the range of $2.29-$2.31 compared with the previous guidance of $2.15-$2.21.Agilent’s recent acquisition of U.K.-based Cobalt Light Systems will also allow it to strengthen its presence in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market.
