0,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) intends to acquire 30% stake of Intesa SanPaolo's asset management unit, per Reuters. According to sources familiar with the matter, BlackRock views the deal as an acquisition rather than an investment and it aims to extend its influence over the second-biggest fund house in Italy.One of the sources informed, “BlackRock is the natural buyer for Eurizon. They will take a stake and use it as a Trojan horse to plug in their IT systems and control the operational side of the business.”Eurizon, which operates in Italy as well as Eastern Europe and Asia, has nearly €315 billion in assets under management (AUM). It is one of the most efficient asset managers in Europe and has a cost-income ratio of 20%.Over the past several months, Intesa has been looking for options for Eurizon and to do so, it has been working with UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report), according to sources.Intesa’s plan has been to look for such deals with global asset managers, which would open more options for other smaller or similar-sized companies for partnerships. When in February, Intesa stated that it wishes to establish a partnership with an asset manager, its CEO, Carlo Messina informed that it is best to come to a decision as quickly as possible so that an agreement is reached upon by this year.However, recently, in Venice, Messina revealed that Intesa is still in the early stages to look for an investor in Eurizon.Notably, Intesa does not want to give up its control of the unit and hence, does not plan to sell more than 30% of Eurizon. However, if BlackRock acquires 30% stake of Eurizon, Intesa’s desire to establish accords with other partners is not going to be accomplished and those deals will only translate into commercial partnerships.Nevertheless, this deal will be beneficial for Intesa as it will help drive growth at Eurizon. Tommaso Corcos, the CEO of Eurizon informed, “Size will matter more and more.""Notably, since Intesa’s main source of revenues is from its asset management business, it targets to receive nearly €10 billion in fees in 2021, which would account for 48% of its total operating income.Being the largest asset manager in the United States, BlackRock’s main aim is to further enhance its technological capabilities. The company wants to integrate its global satellites onto its operating system Aladdin.With a strong global presence, broad product diversification, revenue mix and steadily improving AUM, its revenues are expected to improve further. Also, BlackRock’s investment in U.S. iShare core ETFs is expected to continue driving growth across a broader range of iShares precision exposures in the near term.Shares of the company have gained 22% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.7%.Currently, BlackRock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Lazard Ltd (LAZ  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report).

The bottom line came in 24% higher than the prior-year quarter’s tally.Shares of Eaton Vance have declined more than 5% since the earnings release on Tuesday. Investors seem to be wary of the decline in revenues (down 2%) and fall in assets under management (down 2%) on a sequential basis.Higher revenues and growth in assets under management (AUM) on a year-over-year basis supported the results. Further, the company’s liquidity position remained strong.

This upside was mainly driven by higher management fees and other revenues. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $425.3 million.Total expenses 10% from the prior-year quarter to $281.6 million, largely due to higher compensation and related costs, fund-related expenses and distribution expenses.Total operating income grew 13% year over year to $132.7 million.Liquidity Position Strong, AUM ImprovesAs of Apr 30, 2018, Eaton Vance had $511.7 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $610.6 million as of Oct 31, 2016. Further, the company had no borrowings outstanding against its new $300-million credit facility.Eaton Vance’s consolidated AUM increased 24% from the year-ago quarter to $440.1 billion, reflecting net inflows of $28.6 billion and a market price appreciation of $24.5 billion.Share RepurchaseDuring the first six months of fiscal 2018, Eaton Vance repurchased nearly 2 million shares of its Non-Voting Common Stock for $109.5 million under the company’s existing repurchase authorization.Our ViewpointEaton Vance’s improving AUM, along with revenue rise, will likely support its growth in the quarters ahead.

2,BLK,"With an aim to provide access to its sophisticated alternative investment strategies to a broader client base, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) is reducing the minimum requirement for participating in various alternative investment strategies that the company’s asset-management arm offers.Per a Bloomberg report, the new limit has been set at $100,000, down from the previous requirement of $10 million. This reduction will increase access to certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies to the masses, which was restricted earlier only to institutions and the ultra-rich.For this, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the asset management arm of the bank, has agreed to use the technology of iCapital Network Inc.iCapital is a financial technology platform that offers alternative investments like hedge funds, private equity and real estate to high net worth individuals and other wealth advisors at lower minimums, thereby simplifying access to such investments for investors.Per the agreement, J.P. Morgan Asset Management will partner with iCapital so that high net worth investors and their advisors can access certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies by using iCapital’s digital platform.Anton Pil, Managing Partner of J.P. Morgan Global Alternatives said, ""As we get later in the economic cycle, identifying alternative sources of return is an essential consideration for investors looking to build stronger portfolios. Institutional clients have long embraced alternatives as a strategic part of their asset allocation, and many high-net-worth investors continue to be under-allocated to alternatives relative to their institutional counterparts.""He added, ""Given the current rising interest rate environment, investors are looking for alternative sources of income that provide diversification to broader fixed income markets, and as a result, we are starting with several of our income-focused Alternative Investment strategies.""By using such technological platforms, high net worth individuals will also be able to build portfolios without relying on the brokers for advice. This will reduce their investment costs as brokers charge commissions, which increases investors’ total expenses.Apart from JPMorgan, BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) works with iCapital. UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have also been found to have an interest in the venture.Shares of JPMorgan have gained 33.2% in the past year, outperforming 20.4% growth of the industry.JPMorgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) recently agreed to sell its 40% stake in DSP BlackRock Investment Managers to the DSP Group, headed by Hemendra Kothari, thereby exiting the Indian mutual fund business.DSP BlackRock is a joint venture between BlackRock and the DSP Group, with total assets of nearly Rs. 1.1 trillion, including mutual funds, alternative investment funds (AIFs), and assets under advisory services.The DSP Group is one of the oldest financial firms in India and owns 60% of the stake in the joint venture.According to a person familiar with the matter, BlackRock initially planned on buying the DSP Group’s 60% stake in the company. But, the DSP Group wanted to retain its presence in India and hence chose not to sell its stake.Rather, BlackRock decided to sell its 40% stake to the DSP Group because it could not integrate DSP BlackRock into its technology and operating platform since it had only a minority stake in the company.Notably, in the past few years, various other asset managers like The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report) and others exited the Indian mutual fund industry because of higher costs and stricter regulations.Now, after the 40% stake is acquired by the DSP Group, the asset management company is going to be called as DSP Mutual Fund.Kothari said, “For the past few years both DSP and Blackrock have been debating who will own the majority stake in the mutual fund business because Blackrock is a leader in many international markets. On the other hand, our financial group is 150 years old, which is possibly one of the oldest in India. And DSP Group is one of the few financial groups that focus purely on investment management.”He added, “Going forward, by strengthening our technology, sales and training processes further, we will do even better, especially because the opportunities are huge and penetration is low. So far we have grown organically but going forward we may definitely look at acquisitions, depending on the circumstances.”BlackRock, being one of the leading asset managers, offers a variety of products, including active, enhanced and index strategies through a variety of structures like separate accounts, mutual funds, iShares (ETFs) and other pooled investment vehicles. Given its strong global presence, broad product diversification, revenue mix and steadily improving assets under management (AUM), the company remains well poised for growth.In the past year, its shares have gained 37.6%, outperforming 14.3% growth recorded by the industry. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s economic net income per unit of 42 cents handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. However, the bottom line deteriorated 35% from the prior-year quarter.Apart from the earnings beat, KKR’s decision to change its business structure also cheered investors.

Also, the company announced a rise in its share repurchase authorization to $500 million, effective immediately.Results primarily reflected drastic decline in expenses and impressive growth in assets under management (AUM). However, lower revenues acted as a headwind.Net income attributable to KKR for the quarter was $178.4 million or 32 cents per unit, down from $267.7 million or 52 cents per unit in the year-ago quarter.Revenues & Expenses Decrease, AUM ImprovesTotal revenues (GAAP basis) amounted to $472.6 million, plunging 38% on a year-over-year basis. The fall was largely due to a lower level of carried interest gains.Total operating expenses declined 19% from the prior-year quarter to $436.6 million.

Also, fee-paying AUM summed $119.7 billion, improving 12% from the Mar 31, 2017 figure.Our ViewpointKKR will continue exploiting lucrative investment opportunities on the back of its efficient fund-raising capability, in the quarters ahead.

Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 40 cents.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. However, higher expenses were the major headwind. Also, a slight decline in assets under management (AUM) hurt results to quite an extent. Probably because of these negatives, shares of the company declined nearly 8.6%, following the release.Net income attributable to Waddell & Reed totaled $46.3 million, up 36.8% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues & Expenses Rise, AUM FallsOperating revenues in the quarter rose 3.9% year over year to $297.6 million, reflecting rise in investment management fees along with underwriting and distribution fees.

Also, net outflows were $1.46 billion at the end of the reported quarter, down from $3.39 billion at the end of the prior-year quarter.Operating expenses increased 1.8% year over year to $237.7 million. The rise was due to higher distribution cost, compensation and benefits expense, depreciation cost and subadvisory fees.Operating margin was 20.1%, up from 18.5% a year ago.As of Mar 31, 2018, AUM totaled $80.21 billion, down from $81.08 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s cash and cash equivalents as well as investment securities, totaled $819.9 million.

The company returned a total of $41.4 million to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.Our ViewpointMuted growth in AUM is likely to hamper Waddell & Reed’s financials in the near term.

Further, the reported figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter figure of 83 cents.Top-line strength and growth in assets under management (AUM) were positives.

On a GAAP basis, Lazard’s net income came in at $160 million or $1.21 per share compared with $108 million or 81 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsIn the first quarter, adjusted operating revenues came in at $724 million, up 16% year over year. The upsurge can chiefly be attributed to increase in financial advisory and asset-management revenues.Adjusted operating expenses were around $518.1 million in the quarter, up 12.6% year over year. Higher compensation and benefits, and non-compensation expenses led to the upswing.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense flared up 14%, on a year-over-year basis, to $404 million.

The uptick primarily stemmed from increase in revenues from M&A advisory, partially offset by lower restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenues were $330 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter.

This included dividend payment of $202 million, share repurchase of $146 million and $101 million paid for meeting employee-tax obligations in exchange of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.Our ViewpointResults reflect an impressive quarter for Lazard. Though the company’s diverse footprint, steady capital-deployment activities and revenue strength position it favorably for the long run, macro headwinds, elevated costs pressure and stringent regulations put the company’s financials under strain. Lazard Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lazard Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lazard Ltd QuoteCurrently, Lazard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

8,BLK,"Legg Mason Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) reported positive earnings surprise of 22.9% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31). The company reported adjusted net income of 86 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Moreover, results improved 13.2% year over year.Top-line strength and steady assets under management (AUM) were the tailwinds. However, rise in expenses remain a major drag.Legg Mason reported net income of $76.3 million compared with $75.9 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Including certain one-time items, for fiscal 2018, net income came in at $352.1 million or $3.72 per share compared with $227.3 million or $2.18 per share in the prior fiscal.Revenues Rise, Expenses Flare UpFor fiscal 2018, Legg Mason reported total revenues of $3.1 billion, up 9% year over year, reflecting higher average long-term AUM, along with elevated non-pass through as well as pass-through performance fees. Revenues came in almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Legg Mason’s total operating revenues in the quarter came in at $785.1 million, up 9% year over year. The upsurge was mainly due to elevated average long-term AUM and non-pass performance fees, as well as higher pass-through performance fees. In addition, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $759.3 million.Investment advisory fees increased 11.3% year over year to $702.6 million in the quarter. Further, other revenues surged 66.7% year over year to $1.5 million. However, distribution and service fees were down 10.7% year over year to $80.9 million.Operating expenses rose 1% to $618.3 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, other expenses, and communications and technology expenses.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 23.8%, up from 20.6% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Solid Assets PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, Legg Mason’s AUM was $754.1 billion, up 3.5% year over year from $728.4 billion. Of the total AUM, fixed income constituted 56%, equity 27%, liquidity 8% and alternatives represented 9%.Nevertheless, AUM edged down 1.7% sequentially from $767.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, impacted by negative market performance, and other of $3.1 billion and realizations of $0.5 billion. Furthermore, long-term inflows of $1.2 billion were offset by liquidity outflows of $10.7 billion. However, positive foreign exchange of $2.9 billion was a favorable factor.Notably, long-term net inflows of $2.1 billion included equity outflows of $3.2 billion, offset by fixed income inflows of $2.8 billion and alternative inflows of $0.5 billion. Additionally, average AUM was $766.9 billion compared with $718.9 billion witnessed in the prior-year quarter, and $759.9 billion in the previous quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, Legg Mason had $736.1 million in cash. Total debt was $2.4 billion, including $100-million revolver repayment in March 2018. Shareholders’ equity came in at $3.9 billion.The ratio of total debt to total capital (total equity plus total debt excluding consolidated investment vehicles) was 38%, down from 39% in the prior quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateIn the reported quarter, Legg Mason did not retired shares as accelerated repurchases occurred in the prior quarter.Concurrent with the earnings release, Legg Mason announced a hike in its quarterly common stock dividend to 34 cents per share, up 21.4%. The new dividend will be paid on Jul 9 to shareholders on record as of Jun 12, 2018.Our ViewpointWe believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers over the long run, given its diversified product mix and leverage in the changing market demography. In addition to these, with strategic acquisitions, restructuring initiatives and cost-cutting measures, we anticipate operating efficiencies to improve. Also, steady capital-deployment activities continue to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. However, escalating expenses remain a key concern. Legg Mason, Inc.

However, since the latest earnings performance is yet to be reflected in the estimate revisions, the rank is subject to change.

10,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3.1%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.44 has decreased marginally over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.7%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.28 billion, which reflects growth of 16.1% year over year.Strong fundamentals helped shares of the company to gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 14.4% growth of the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q1 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q1 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, it is likely that BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter as well. Thus, driven by steady inflows, AUM is likely to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.49 trillion, which reflects rise of 3.3%, sequentially.While higher AUM is expected to have a positive impact on investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, this effect is likely to be slightly offset by the muted market performance that was witnessed during the quarter. Thus, the investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, are likely to witness only a marginal improvement in the quarter.However, performance fees, which is another major revenue component is not expected to improve during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the first quarter is $65 million, which represents decline of 77.2% from the prior quarter.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to a further rise in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 19.

11,BLK,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 economic net income (ENI) of 65 cents per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. However, the figure was 20% below the prior-year quarter level.Shares of Blackstone have gained more than 2% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with its announcement of additional capital deployment action. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.The quarter saw an improvement in assets under management (AUM), mainly driven by inflows. However, lower revenues and a rise in expenses were the undermining factors.Blackstone reported ENI of $791.7 million, down 18% year over year.Revenues & Costs DeclineTotal revenues (GAAP basis) declined 8% year over year to $1.77 billion. The decrease was mainly due to lower total investment income and incentive fees. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 billion.Total expenses (GAAP basis) rose 7% year over year to $982.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a rise in fund expenses and general, administrative and other costs.Fee-earning AUM grew 23% year over year to $334.7 billion. Total AUM amounted to $449.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 22% year over year. The rise in total AUM was largely driven by $18.2 billion of inflows.As of Mar 31, 2018, Blackstone had $5.4 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and corporate treasury investments.Capital Deployment UpdateBlackstone authorized share repurchase of up to $1 billion of common units and Blackstone Holdings partnership units. This nearly triples $335.8 million of buyback authorization left under the prior authorization.Moreover, Blackstone received approximately $580 million of pre-tax proceeds in connection with concluding GSO’s investment sub-advisory relationship with FS Investments in April. The company plans to distribute part of the proceeds to unitholders. This will likely result in an incremental 30 cents per unit to be distributed over the next three quarters.Our ViewpointBlackstone remains well positioned to capitalize on the changing investment landscape by making long-term investments and augmenting its fund-raising abilities. However, increased dependence on management and advisory fees can affect the company’s financials in the near term.The Blackstone Group L.P. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Blackstone Group L.P. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Blackstone Group L.P. QuoteBlackstone carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in AUM and steady long-term inflows.

12,BLK,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) have tried to recover since CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of members of Congress last week. While investors continue to assess Facebook’s recently clouded future, let’s take a look at some of the most interesting compensation information from Facebook’s proxy statement that might have been lost in the shuffle amid all the turmoil.ZuckerbergZuckerberg’s net worth is roughly $70 billion, making him one of the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. But this number can fluctuate by billions of dollars because most of Zuckerberg’s massive fortune is tied directly to Facebook’s stock price. In fact, the CEO of one of the world’s largest companies has for years earned an official salary of just $1, according to the company’s recently filed proxy statement.With that said, Zuckerberg’s 2017 compensation packaged totaled $8.8 million, which comes almost entirely from the $7.3 million spent on his personal security—both at his residences and during travel—and the $1.5 million spent on the CEO’s travel on the company’s private aircraft. These costs also skyrocketed 54% from the $5.8 million spent on his travel and security in 2016. The big jump stems mostly from Zuckerberg’s massive 2017 tour around the U.S. that helped boost his security costs to what would amount to $20,000 a day.These costs are minuscule considering that Facebook made over $40 billion last year. Still, some investors might soon become more upset by just how much power Zuckerberg wields at Facebook as criticism about the company’s handling of user data mounts.The CEO held 8.7 million of Class A shares and 392.7 million Class B shares—which accounted for nearly 90% of all Class B shares. Zuckerberg’s stock holdings grant him roughly 60% of total voting power at Facebook.Moving on from Zuckerberg, let’s take a quick look at the rest of the executive officers and the board of directors’ compensation packages.Other Executives Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg’s base pay in 2017 was $805,000, while the rest of the executive officers, David Wehner, Christopher Cox, and Mike Schroepfer, took home $720,000.However, when you factor in stock options and bonuses Sandberg made $25.2 million last year, most of which came in the form of stock awards. Sandberg’s total compensation did include $2.7 million worth of security costs.Meanwhile, no other executive officer’s yearly travel or security amounted to more than $10,000 over the last three years, though they all made roughly $22 million in total compensation. Interestingly, officer’s bonus pay was noticeably lower across the board.MiscellaneousNetflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) CEO Reed Hastings and Peter Thiel both collected $349,151 just for being on Facebook’s board in 2017, mostly in the form of stock awards. The other three members of the board made comparable amounts last year.The proxy statement also listed Facebook’s median income, in accordance with a broader requirement of a postcrisis law that went into effect this year. Facebook claimed that its median total annual 2017 compensation for all employees—excluding Zuckerberg—was $240,430. This means the company’s CEO-to-median-employee pay ratio came in at 37:1, based only on Zuckerberg’s technical compensation of $8.8 million in security and travel fees.Fellow social media power Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) recently announced that its annual median employee total compensation for the last year was $161,860.It is also worth noting that aside from Zuckerberg, Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Eduardo Saverin still both hold roughly 6.5% of total voting power. The only other 5% or above stockholders, aside from Zuckerberg, Moskovitz, and Saverin are BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), Fidelity, and Vanguard—which all own around 2% of Facebook.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

13,BLK,"Unlike preceding quarters,net asset inflows to BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) ETF business dropped 46% in the first quarter to $34.6 billion from the year-ago quarter. However, despite a decline in inflows, BlackRock’s first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings came in at $6.70 per share, which breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.42.Also, the bottom line was 28% higher than the year-ago quarter. Net income (on a GAAP basis) was $2.19 billion, up 27% from the prior-year quarter (read: Solid ETF Asset Inflows Boost BlackRock Earnings).Revenues (GAAP basis) were $3.58 billion, up 16% year over year. The rise was driven by an increase in all revenue components except investment advisory performance fees, which remained stable. The reported figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.28 billion. Total assets under management increased to $6.3 trillion.What Caused a Declined in ETF Inflows?The world's largest asset manager has been making a killing for the last few quarters thanks to lower fees.BlackRock slashed expense fees for some of its iShares ETFs in recent times. It is being said that the company took the step to give tough competition to other low-cost players like Vanguard and Schwab (read: 6 ETF Trends Likely to Take Centre Stage in 2017).Thanks to investors’ quest for lower fees,ETFs charging 0.2% or less made up about 82% of the industry’s net flows in Q1, up from 77% in the fourth quarter, according to research from Bloomberg Intelligence.According to the article published on Bloomberg, a correction in the broader market in Q1 thanks to rising rate concerns and increasing inflationary expectations led increased market volatility, which in turn kept investors from further ETF investments. Plus, the tax reform passed in late 2017 led mainly institutional investors to de-risk and re-balance their portfolios, according to BlackRock’s chief executive officer.iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA  -  Free Report) tracing Europe, Australia and Far East was the topper with about $14.6 billion inflows, but despite targeting the EAFE market, iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA  -  Free Report) lost about $6.19 billion in assets.Emerging market funds like iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG  -  Free Report) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM  -  Free Report) hauled in about $6.13 and $2.60 billion in assets, respectively, but iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD  -  Free Report) and iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) saw respectively $5.75 billion and $3.75 billion of assets fleeing (read: Q1 ETF Asset Report: Developed Markets Win, High-Yield Loses).Pressure Ahead of BlackRock?Several analysts are of the view it would be tough for BlackRock ahead to hold up the same success in revenue and profit growth in the coming days. “Sustaining growth at double-digits in terms of asset flows will be really tough to do"" for BlackRock, said an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.Moreover, a set of rules under the Department of Labor’s “fiduciary standard,” which asked advisors to give precedence to their client’s interest over their own, led brokers to dump cash into low cost ETFs. Now, with chances of deregulations in the financial sector doing rounds, such urgencies may not be felt by brokers.Since BlackRock’s less-expensive ETFs contribute greatly to its business growth, the asset manager could feel the pressure on revenues ahead. In fact, to maintain profitability, BlackRock is also striving to broaden its exposure to higher-fee alternative offerings and focusing on building its technology business.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

16,BLK,"BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), the world’s largest asset manager, mulls over brining about two exchange-traded funds that will eliminate civilian firearm makers and large sellers after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.Last week, the issuer said it will change the underlying index for its existing ESG ETFs to indexes that particularly forbid civilian firearms manufacturers and large retailers if they generate 5% or more in revenues, or more than $20 million annually, from civilian firearms-related products.BlackRock also indicated that 95% of its passively managed funds did not have shares of gun stocks like American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC  -  Free Report), Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc. (RGR  -  Free Report) or Vista Outdoor Inc. (VSTO  -  Free Report). Also,no BlackRock active mutual fund holds those gun stocks.BlackRock also plans to launch two ETFs namely iShares MSCI USA Small-Cap ESG Optimized ETF ESML and iShares ESG US Aggregate Bond ETF. Both funds will bar the inclusion of large retailers and producers of civilian firearms. While the small-cap fund could make a debut soon, investors can expect a debut of the bond fund later this year (read: No Trump Bump for 'Bump Stocks': Time to Invest in ESG ETFs?).Why the Exclusion of Gun Stocks?In February, President Trump has ordered a ban on gun accessories known as “bump stocks” and the U.S. attorney general, has officially proposed regulations that would effectively put an embargo on bump stocks in late March. Notably, “a bump fire stock is attached to the end a rifle to turn the semi-automatic into a fully automatic firearm.”In February, the National Rifle Association (NRA) also buttressed the review by saying “the NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” However, the proposed regulators first need to be published in the Federal Register and then be subject to public comment before being accepted, per CNBC.com.The President’s move came as an administrative measure following the mass shooting in Las Vegas. A gunman, with at least 12 rifles fitted with bump stocks, killed 58 and wounded many in Las Vegas last October. In December, the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) started reviewing whether bump stocks are legal. With this, Florida school shooting in March made the exclusion of gun stocks crucial.Will the New ETFs See Success?As much as 35% of U.S. stock mutual funds target makers or retailers of guns and ammunition, which translates into “more than $17 billion spread across more than 2,000 funds,” per a tally by a non-profit advocacy group called Goodbye Gun Stocks, quoted on cbsnews.com. But BlackRock’s intention to reduce its presence in this segment materially makes its products more ESG-sensitive.Socially-responsible ETFs should get a real Trump bump from this ban order. Socially-responsible investing seeks to avoid damage or mischief by screening companies on environmental, social and governance fronts.It excludes companies with a negative social or environmental impact, such as weapons, alcohol, tobacco and gambling. Additionally, companies with a good track of socially-responsible activities generally outperform over the long term (read: Guide to Socially Responsible ETFs).BlackRock Solidifying ESG Presence The launch of ETFs without gun stocks and fee cuts of two ETFs MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI  -  Free Report) and iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA  -  Free Report) strengthened BlackRock’s presence in the ESG space.

21,BLK,"Recent weeks have been dominated by escalating trade hostility between the United States and China and regulation of Big Tech. Starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts are looking for a strong Q1 earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy signed into law last December, and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.While the highest year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be notched by energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are also expected to contribute handsomely. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.Q1 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors are looking forward to the outset of the Q1 earnings season on Apr 12 and 13, when bigwigs like BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) will be reporting their Q1 numbers, and for the whole of S&P 500 results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump’s polices, including tax cuts and solid global economic growth. The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas.Trump’s economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month. The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March, by the way, reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.Potential Gainers of Q1The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 60.3% from the same period last year on 15.6% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily backing the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q1 earnings expected to rise 41.4% on 20.2% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q1 earnings poised to be up 36.1% from the same period last year on 15.9% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 23.9% from the same period last year on 12.3% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Some analysts, in the meantime, are worried that investors will start to rotate out of the crowded tech sector this year and into other sectors that will benefit from the lower taxes. So far though, in spite of such uncertainty, the technology sector outperformed the broader S&P 500. In fact, Q1 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 20.7% from the same period last year on 11.4% higher revenues.High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q1 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 19.1% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on heightened volatility and higher interest rates (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthRepublican tax cut and a very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q1.

22,BLK,"Stocks opened lower and stayed in the red throughout early morning trading Friday after reports emerged suggesting that President Trump is doubling down on tariffs and has ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to consider new charges on an additional $100 million in Chinese imports.The move is an extension of trade disputes between the U.S. and China that stretch back to early March, when the Trump administration announced tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Concerns that this issue would snowball into a full-blown, tit-for-tat trade war escalated this week as both nations released their own lists of products to target.All of these tariffs are part of ongoing negotiations, and it is unclear exactly how things will unfold just yet. Nevertheless, trade anxiety is high and could control the direction of stocks until earnings season gets cranking over the next few weeks.The upcoming week is not packed with reports, but it does mark the unofficial start of earnings season with the big financials announcing next Friday. With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.In this piece, we will be taking a look at three of the most-important reports to anticipate before the big financials announce on Friday.

BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report)Investment management behemoth BlackRock is set to report its first-quarter earnings results before the market opens on April 12. BlackRock shares have dipped during recent market volatility, but the stock is still up nearly 36% since this time last year.

Investors will hope that BlackRock can justify that premium with solid results. 3. Delta Air Lines, Inc.

The company recently issued an encouraging outlook with respect to total revenue per available seat miles for the quarter, with the metric expected to improve by approximately 5%.

27,BLK,"As we enter the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks having unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)

29,BLK,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, Q4 earnings season finally gets rolling this Friday. Though we have seen companies like Delta and Fed Ex report for the quarter in the past days and weeks, this morning we see a flock of banks and investment firms all reporting Q4 numbers, signaling the next three weeks of heavy earnings data to be reported ahead.First up, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 7 cents per share, coming in at $1.76. (This, by the way, excludes a 69 cent-per-share impact — $2.4 billion — as a result of the pending tax reform laws.) Revenues in the quarter reached $25.5 billion, versus the $25.0 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company returned a total of $67 billion to shareholders in 2017, by way of share buybacks and dividend yields. These numbers illustrate a healthy quarter — augmented a bit by a big drop in Fixed Income Markets (-27%) — with a very positive outlook. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report) posted strong Q4 results, putting up $6.24 per share versus the $6.08 consensus estimate, on $3.47 billion in revenues that outpaced the $3.35 billion expected. From a top-line standpoint, this represents gains of 20% year over year. Fiscal year earnings hit $22.60 per share, +17% year over year. For more on BLK’s earnings, click here.However, we see a mixed report for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) this morning. The Zacks Rank #3 bank topped earnings estimates, posting $1.16 versus $1.07 anticipated, but missed on revenues — $22,050 million compared with the $22,381 million in the Zacks consensus estimate. The company is also still trying to win back trust from customers following its fake accounts scandal.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also surpassed estimates for its Q4 sales and earnings — $2.29 per share beat the $2.20 we had been looking for, where revenues of $4.26 billion outperformed the expected $4.17 billion. This amounts to top-line gains of 10% year over year. For more on PNC’s earnings, click here.Consumer Price Index & Retail SalesFinally today, another couple key metrics from a domestic economic standpoint: both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales reads hit the tape ahead of today’s open. The CPI read follows the Producer Price Index (PPI) for December, which came in lower than expected.For the CPI headline we see +0.1%, lower than the +0.3% we were looking for but at least still in positive territory. Ex-food & energy, this number does hit 0.3%. Year over year we see CPI growth of 2.1%, down a tick from November’s read. These numbers appear lukewarm, but are at least a little hotter than the PPI figures we saw earlier.Retail Sales came in-line with expectations at +0.4%, following a by-most-accounts strong holiday shopping season. Ex-auto sales — as well as ex-autos & gas — this figure stays at 0.4%. Not only that, but the prior retail headline, from before the holidays, was revised considerably upward, from 0.8% last read to 1.4% this morning. We may see these numbers manifest in quarterly earnings for retailers, but we’re about a month away from seeing those reports come in.

35,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues and rise in assets under management (AUM).Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBlackRock’s business activities and prospects have encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.99 has increased 1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 16.5%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company gain 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the 32.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the rally in share price continue post Q4 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on if the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q4 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.42%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Q4 ResultsWith its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs, BlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. Driven by steady inflows, the company’s AUM is likely to witness further improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.15 trillion, which reflects a rise of 19.5% year over year.As a result of higher AUM in the quarter, the company’s investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 85% of the total revenues, is also expected to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 5.2%.Moreover, since the New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions. Higher fee rate, coupled with growth in AUM will likely support performance fees growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fee for the fourth quarter is $149 million, which is expected to witness growth of 15.5% year over year.Improvement in two of the major revenue components will likely give a boost to total revenues as well. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.32 billion, which reflects growth of 14.8% year over year.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

36,BLK,"Believe it or not, investments can actually begin with just $100. True, there are plenty of stocks available for less than a penny, but investing $100 in stocks may not always provide investors the diversity that mutual funds can assure. Moreover, risks associated with penny stocks are much higher.On the other hand, there are low-cost mutual funds with decent returns where investors can invest just $100. These funds are even offered by prominent firms like BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW  -  Free Report). Mutual funds are an affordable option for diversity as well as a safer investment bet.Investing in Mutual FundsMutual funds are great options for investors looking for a relatively less risky way to earn at least more than what fixed income instruments offer. Money from individuals and even organizations are invested in stocks, bonds, or other assets covering diverse industries globally.One of the benefits of mutual funds is that it allows a small investor to invest in a basket of securities at one go. Investors need not worry about investing a large chunk in securities separately. Moreover, these are less risky than any individual asset class as underperformance of a security gets mitigated by outperformance of others in the portfolio. In addition to the asset diversification, mutual funds also provide liquidity, economies of scale, and are professionally managed.A $100 investment cannot make an investor rich. This can only be to get someone started with investments, with the actual returns coming when an investor decides to invest a certain amount of money for a considerable time. So, this can double up as a great retirement plan as well.3 Best Bets NowA $100 bet will make more sense when the bulk of that amount is invested and no charges are paid from it. Funds that carry no sales load and have relatively low expense ratios should be preferred. It is also important to look at the performance track record.The following funds hold either a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy), as we expect the funds to outperform its peers in the future.

40,BLK,"During the Q2 earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Despite inflation-related issues and increasing chances of political uncertainty, we can add some asset managers to our portfolio based on strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is one such stock which not only recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 1.92% over the trailing four quarters, but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2017 and 2018 inched up slightly.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 18.5% so far, this year, compared with 22.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, BlackRock has a number of other aspects that make it an attractive investment option right now.Why BlackRock is a Must BuyEarnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: In the last three to five years, BlackRock witnessed EPS growth of 8.8%, driven by solid global presence that allows broad diversification and organic growth. The company’s earnings are projected to grow 13.8% and 14.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Further, its long-term (three to five years) expected EPS growth of 11.9% promises reward for shareholders.Revenue Strength: BlackRock’s revenues (on GAAP basis) witnessed a five-year CAGR of 4.5% (2012-2016), with the trend continuing in the first half of 2017. Also, the top line is anticipated to grow nearly 9.2% in 2017, considerably higher than the industry average of 3.8%. This indicates its superiority in generating revenues.Impressive Capital Deployment Activities: Driven by its capital strength, BlackRock’s capital deployment activities are impressive. In January, the company announced a 9% dividend hike and it has a share buyback plan in place. With a sturdy capital position, the company will likely continue rewarding shareholders through strategic capital deployment.Strategic Acquisitions: BlackRock has expanded primarily via acquisitions, with majority of its assets under management (AUM) growth driven by the same. Recently, it acquired the First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds and completed the deal to acquire financial technology provider — Cachematrix, while it has acquired several global and domestic firms over the years. All these are anticipated to support the company’s AUM growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Wintrust Financial Corporation (WTFC  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

41,BLK,"Even as the sentiment toward the energy sector had turned sour of late on account of concerns over record U.S. shale output, the mutual fund industry seems to lap up leading stocks in the segment. In particular, BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) – the world’s largest asset manager – recently announced that its $39-billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund boosted its exposure to “select names” in energy.While the Zacks Oil-Energy sector has lagged the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period (the sector has lost 14.9% of its value versus the 8.6% growth of the broader index), Russ Koesterich, one of the portfolio managers of BlackRock’s biggest mutual fund, believes that the underperformance of energy stocks creates investing opportunities.With oil prices relatively stable and trading in a fairly narrow band, Koesterich said the fund’s managers have identified companies in the midstream, refining, exploration and production space in the U.S., apart from an European integrated major. However, he did not name any stocks.Is BlackRock Right in Betting on Energy?Oil has rebounded from its multi-year lows reached in 2016 and while the commodity may not be at a level many thought it would be at this time of the year, even at today’s prices certain companies are in a position to earn profits. And while we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility, many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2017. Here’s why:Sharp Inventory Drawdowns: Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. The nation's oil stockpiles have shrunk in 17 of the last 19 weeks and are down more than 60 million barrels since March.The Shift into ""Backwardation"": Recently, the front-month Brent contract have shifted into ""backwardation"" – a phenomenon when near-term oil futures trade at a premium to futures dated further out. Analysts consider this as a bullish signal with the so-called backwardated market helping flush out inventories by eliminating the incentive to put oil in storage.Fall in Rig Count: According to Baker Hughes, the GE-owned company’s closely watched weekly report, the oil rig count has gone down for a second week in three. This implies that U.S. energy firms are cutting down on their capital investment plans in reaction to low crude prices. Importantly, this is an indicator of lower future production.OPEC Curbs Are Working: As per PetroLogistics – an organization tracking the cartel’s shipments – OPEC oil production is set to fall by a massive 419,000 barrels per day in August. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Oil Demand Estimates Upped: Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly.Follow BlackRock and Jump into the Energy BandwagonWith the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund’s lowest-cost shares returning around +10% this year – ahead of most of its competitors – following on the footsteps of the investment giant can be a great move.But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved nearly 2% higher over the last 7 days.Before posting earnings beat in Q4, the company delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters.As a result, the company overall surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 3% in the trailing four quarters.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteRevenue Came In Higher-than-ExpectedBlackRock posted revenues (on GAAP basis) of $3.47 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35 billion.

43,BLK,"Key bank earnings are scheduled for release this Friday. The figures are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s prospects in the near future. Banking stocks are expected to gain from recently concluded tax cuts, but not without suffering a short cycle of discomfort. Most of these have already issued a warning about a likely difficult fourth quarter owing to accounting adjustments necessary to adapt to the new tax structure.For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) has already warned that its fourth-quarter results could be impacted by almost $2 billion due to the new tax law. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has remained silent on this issue. In this context, key bank earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next, including BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), assume greater significance. With JPMorgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report on Jan 12, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock now. Both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits. Currently, JPMorgan holds total assets of $376.5 billion while Wells Fargo has total assets of $305.7 billion. Our research shows that the average one-year trailing 12-month ROA for Wells Fargo is at 1.16%, higher than 1.06% for JPMorgan.Price PerformanceJPMorgan has gained 11.7% over the last three months, outperforming the broader industry which has gained 8.9% over the same period. In comparison, Wells Fargo has not only outperformed the broader industry but is only fractionally behind JPMorgan, gaining 11.6% over the same time frame. ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.79. This is below the S&P 500 average of 3.87. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry. Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.62 JPMorgan is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Wells Fargo is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.69, it is marginally pricier than JPMorgan.   Dividend YieldWells Fargo’s dividend yield over a year is 2.52%. With a dividend yield of 2.07%, JPMorgan shareholders fetch a somewhat lower dividend yield than Wells Fargo. Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, JPMorgan has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.8%. Wells Fargo has matched this feat, but with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.8%, it loses this round to its larger rival. But the situation changes when considering Earnings ESP values, with JPMorgan clocking in at -0.62% while Wells Fargo’s reading stands at +0.76%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that JPMorgan holds an edge over Wells Fargo when considering a more detailed earnings history. Both stocks are neck to neck when considering price performance and valuation. However, Wells Fargo is superior when considering return on assets and dividend yield.Additionally, it carries a positive ESP reading unlike JPMorgan. Both stocks have a the same Zacks Rank and seem to be evenly matched but Wells Fargo is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

44,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) remains well positioned to grow inorganically with the help of a solid liquidity position. Also, the company’s restructuring initiatives are expected to aid top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.However, the company’s rising expenses might curb profitability growth. Also, its high dependence on overseas revenues remains a concern.The company did not witness any earnings estimate revision for the current year over the past 30 days. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable at $21.98. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s revenues have increased at a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 4.5%. Given the company’s strong global presence, its initiatives to strengthen the iShares and ETF operations to meet the changing needs of clients are expected to further support revenues generation in the future.Also, the company has been focusing on strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions have helped its assets under management (AUM) to grow at a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 7.9%.Further, the company has an efficient share repurchase and dividend payment policy in place. Supported by a solid capital position, it should continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, its expenses have increased at a CAGR of 3.2% over the last five years (as of the end of 2016). Persistently rising expenses, primarily due to higher compensation and marketing costs, are expected to hamper bottom-line growth.Also, almost one-third of the company’s revenues are derived from overseas markets. Its dependence on overseas revenues has been gradually increasing, which makes it prone to various regulatory and political risks, and the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.BlackRock’s shares have gained 10.8% so far this year, underperforming the 16.5% growth for the industry it belongs to. Given the concerns, the stock’s movement is expected to be range-bound in the near term.Mentioned below are a few better-ranked stocks from the same space.Cohen & Steers, Inc. (CNS  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 3.6% for the current year over the past 60 days. Its share price has increased 15.5% so far this year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

45,BLK,"Amid the ongoing debate followed by the strongest push in years for gun control, comes the news of another shootout at a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville on Sunday that killed four people and left another four injured. Since the mass shootout at a high school in Florida on Feb 17, which killed 17 people, financial institutions have been taking serious steps by reviewing and making changes in their business relationship with gun manufacturers and retailers.Gun stocks have been on a decline ever since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. And despite the mounting concerns, it’s quite unlikely that the Trump administration will initiate stricter actions on the firearms industry given that Republicans are endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Given this scenario, Corporate America’s voluntary actions to disassociate itself from the gun industry are particularly noteworthy.Financial institutions as well as a number of retailers, which have come up with new restrictions on sale of guns, have created significant pressure on the gun industry. But have gun stocks gained, as they usually do, in the wake of these shootings and corporate action?Corporate America Pushes for Gun Control The gun industry has been witnessing a sharp decline in both sales and profits since the election of Trump in 2016. So much so, that even Trump hinted at tightening background checks for guns in response to Florida massacre. Incidentally, more than half a dozen gunmakers such as Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.’s (RGR  -  Free Report), Vista Outdoors Inc. (VSTO  -  Free Report) and American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC  -  Free Report) produce assault-style rifles.Since then, there has been growing concern over gun control that has been supported by financial firms that have been reviewing their ties with the firearms industry and the NRA. And this has already made some financial companies act seriously toward the gun lobby. Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) became the first major Wall Street bank to announce changes relating to how it will conduct business with gun retailers and introduced restrictions on the sale of firearms for new retail-sector clients.Moreover, BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of new funds and index-tracking products that exclude gun manufacturers and retailers. This means that retailers like Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report), which sells guns along with a wide range of sports gear, and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) will no longer be part of its newly launched funds. Dick’s Sporting has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Understandably, Corporate America is taking its most aggressive measures toward gun control in years. Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is the latest to join forces with other financial institutions. The company recently announced that it would stop financing makers of military-style firearms for civilian use.Retailers, Financial Institutes Raise Gunmakers’ Worry It’s not only the financial institutions but gun retailers also have been voicing their concerns over responsible production and selling of guns. Dick’s Sporting in March came up with a new policy against selling guns to people under 21 years and against selling assault-style guns. This was followed by The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), which announced that it would be exiting the firearms business.This certainly has made gunmakers in the United States wary. Although the Florida shooting immediately saw Corporate America taking aggressive measures to review its ties with gun manufacturers and the NRA, shares of gun manufacturers continued to decline.Increased measures are being taken by financial companies and retailers have put gun manufacturers under pressure. Moreover, Remington Resources Inc. has filed for bankruptcy, while Slide Fire Solutions, the company that created the bump stock, is shutting down its site on May 20. Understandably, the aggressive measures taken by retailers and financial institutes have increased tension among gun manufacturers.Summing UpThe general trend is that gun stocks rise on the assumption of stricter gun control measures. However, that didn’t happen this time around. This is because people tend to buy more firearms on fears of restrictions. However, this time, concerns for gun control didn’t come from the government, which is more likely, given that the Republicans are endorsed by the NRA, but from financial institutes, retailers and individuals. The recent shooting in Nashville is only likely to escalate the worries of gun manufacturers and increased pressure for gun control might make them feel the heat in the days to come.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

48,BLK,"Eaton Vance Corp.’s (EV  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Oct 31) adjusted earnings of 70 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line was 23% above the prior-year quarter’s figure.Results were adversely impacted by a rise in operating expenses. However, higher revenues, growth in assets under management (AUM) and a robust liquidity position supported earnings to some extent.Net income attributable to shareholders was $82.1 million or 69 cents per share, up from $65.1 million or 57 cents in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings were $2.48 per share, up 16% year over year.

52,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 11, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s second-quarter earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by higher expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind.Nevertheless, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Moreover, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.58 for the just-concluded quarter has increased 1.1% over the last 30 days.Shares of the company have gained 21.7% so far this year, underperforming the 24.6% growth for the industry it belongs to. However, we believe the positive trend in estimate revisions will translate into a better price performance in the near term.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBefore we discuss the driving factors in detail, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.40%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsBlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its continued investments in its U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs rather than alternative investments with an aim to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. This will likely further boost its AUM, which witnessed 16% year-over-year growth last quarter.The New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically. As a result, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

53,BLK,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation, affirmed the ratings of Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report). The outlook has been raised from negative to stable. Also, the company’s senior unsecured debt rating has been affirmed at Baa1.The ratings are based on Legg Mason’s progress on acquisitions along with improved investment performance. Also, continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit have led to stable rating. Lastly, stabilization of its credit profile as reflected by lower leverage supported the ratings.Reasons Behind the AffirmationLegg Mason’s senior unsecured rating of Baa1 is indicative of its strong business profile due to the acquisition spree it was involved in between late 2015 and early 2016, and a weaker financial profile. Its acquisition of EnTrust, Clarion and RARE Infrastructure have greatly diversified the product offerings and expanded scale of business. However, the debt level remains elevated from the level before these acquisitions. Moody’s is apprehensive of the pressure on Legg Mason’s financial flexibility due to lower margins and significant use of cash flow for share repurchases. Nevertheless, the concern of extensive cash use is partially mitigated by lower effective cash tax rate.Per Moody’s, Legg Mason’s performance of key products has improved greatly through past strategic moves. Also, revenues have increased on account of higher assets under management (AUM), organic and performance growth. Sales have grown on the back of the company’s initiatives to broaden the vehicles through which clients invest in its products, especially separately managed accounts. Also, its efforts to refine distribution strategy have resulted in continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit.Leverage as a multiple of EBITDA (per Moody’s calculation) stands at 3.3x, which is below of 3.8x as of March 2016, but is still considered to be high for an asset-manager rated Baa1. The improvement in leverage comes from cost efficiencies that have led to margin improvements and the use of $750 million of junior securities (to which Moody's assigns 25% equity credit).What Could Make Moody's Change the Ratings?Legg Mason’s ratings can be revised higher on account of improvement in its market position and asset resilience due to inflows in investment platforms and development of products and services offered. Lastly, total debt / EBITDA ratio of below 2 supported by sufficient excess liquidity would led to a higher rating.On the flip side, Legg Mason's long-term ratings could be downgraded if its AUM resiliency scores decline due to acceleration of net outflows of long-term assets or weak new sales and total debt/EBITDA ratio remains above 4.Shares of Legg Mason have gained 29.2% year to date, outperforming the 24.7% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks That Warrant a LookBlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate have been revised slightly upward for the current year, in the past 60 days.

54,BLK,"Believe it or not, investments can actually begin with just $100. True, there are plenty of stocks available for less than a penny, but investing $100 in stocks may not always provide investors the diversity that mutual funds can assure. Moreover, risks associated with penny stocks are much higher.On the other hand, there are low-cost mutual funds with decent returns where investors can invest just $100. These funds are even offered by prominent firms like BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW  -  Free Report). Mutual funds are an affordable option for diversity as well as a safer investment bet.Investing in Mutual FundsMutual funds are great options for investors looking for a relatively less risky way to earn at least more than what fixed income instruments offer. Money from individuals and even organizations are invested in stocks, bonds, or other assets covering diverse industries globally.One of the benefits of mutual funds is that it allows a small investor to invest in a basket of securities at one go. Investors need not worry about investing a large chunk in securities separately. Moreover, these are less risky than any individual asset class as underperformance of a security gets mitigated by outperformance of others in the portfolio. In addition to the asset diversification, mutual funds also provide liquidity, economies of scale, and are professionally managed.A $100 investment cannot make an investor rich. This can only be to get someone started with investments, with the actual returns coming when an investor decides to invest a certain amount of money for a considerable time. So, this can double up as a great retirement plan as well.3 Best Bets NowA $100 bet will make more sense when the bulk of that amount is invested and no charges are paid from it. Funds that carry no sales load and have relatively low expense ratios should be preferred. It is also important to look at the performance track record.The following funds hold either a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy), as we expect the funds to outperform its peers in the future.

56,BLK,"(0:45) - ETF Trends In The Industry(6:40) – Index Tracking the Market: Toroso ETF Industry Index(12:15) - Weighting For the Index: Who Is On Top?(18:10) - How Important Are ETFs to Index Providers Like MSCI?(21:30) – How Does the ETF Industry Fit in Your Portfolio?(22:40) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAs you might guess from the fact that I host a podcast on ETFs, I am pretty bullish on the future of the Exchange-Traded Fund industry. This is especially true when you compare its growth prospects to the rest of the investing and finance world, as ETF asset growth and fund creation has been quite impressive, and looks to continue down that path in the near term too.But how can you invest in this growth?After all, many companies in the ETF world—such as Vanguard, the #2 asset manager—are not publicly traded. And others that dominate the space, such as Blackrock’s (BLK  -  Free Report) iShares or State Street’s (STT  -  Free Report) SPDRs, are not the entire business for their massive parents. So, what’s an investor to do?Well, if you are looking to invest in the world of ETFs, Mike Venuto, the CIO of Toroso Investments, has some insights. Mike is behind the Toroso ETF Industry Index, the benchmark behind the first fund to offer direct and focused exposure to the ETF industry, the ETF Industry Exposure & Financial Services ETF (TETF  -  Free Report).We discuss this benchmark, and investing in the ETF industry in general, in this week’s edition of the Dutram Report.Industry in FocusIn the podcast, Mike and I address talk of an ‘ETF bubble’ and why we have seen such incredible growth in ETFs over the past few years. We also talk about hurdles to future growth in the market, and the possibility of moving past mutual funds in terms of assets at some point down the line too.We also discuss some of the key players in the ETF world, and what to do with companies that have exposure to ETFs, but aren’t pure plays. I admit that I was a bit skeptical about this aspect, but Mike makes a case for why some of the giants are more tied to ETFs than you might think, and how you can access some of the private companies with service providers too.What’s in the Index?While it shouldn’t be a surprise that a company like WisdomTree (WETF  -  Free Report) is in the benchmark, considering it is the only pure play ETF sponsor that is a public company, there are others that might be more of a surprise to some investors out there. This includes SEI Investments and CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report) just to name a few.Mike also discusses the role that index providers play in the world of ETFs, and how important this business is to companies like MSCI Inc. (MSCI  -  Free Report) and S&P Global (SPGI) as well. Clearly, the ETF world is a bit more diverse than you (and I) initially thought, and it is also more than just a higher growth replacement for XLF. In fact, Mike notes that the benchmark has just a 20% overlap with the index underlying the SPDR financial sector ETF, meaning that this is definitely giving exposure to a unique subset of companies.So, if you’re an ETF ‘nerd’—like both Mike and I are—definitely check out this week’s podcast for more information on the industry and how to invest in its surging growth prospects too!Bottom LineBut what do you think about investing in the ETF industry?

57,BLK,"Shares of Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% following the release of its third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31) results.

61,BLK,"Shares of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) fell to a new all-time intraday low again on Monday morning, only to see the company’s stock price pop later.Snap posted disappointing quarterly earnings last Thursday that fell short of our Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock dipped in after-hours trading on Thursday and fell on Friday as well.Today, in a move that has become all too common of an occurrence for Snapchat’s parent company, Snap stock touched a new all-time low of $11.28 a share. However, after the dip, shares of Snap climbed over 6% in early afternoon trading.What exactly is going on with the struggling social media company that might cause its shares to fluctuate so much?Massive Movement Monday marked a second big expiration date for Snap insiders to begin to sell their stock. JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analyst Doug Anmuth estimated that as many as 782 million shares of Snap became available today. The analyst also noted that even more shares could begin to trade hands after the 180-day lock-up period expires at the end of the month.Over 73 million shares of the social media company have been moved through afternoon trading—Snap’s average volume is just under 21 million.Some Investors Run, Others StaySingapore-based Temasek Holdings dumped its entire stake in Snap, according to a Friday regulatory filing. Snap's seventh-largest shareholder, Fidelity Investments, sold half of its total stake in Evan Spiegel’s company.Yet T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), which is Snap's fifth-largest shareholder, increased its Snap stake to 37.8 million total shares, up from 28.3 million in the second quarter, according to a Monday filing.

The Snap stock dump and the subsequent jump into the company’s chief rival can’t be good news for the disappearing photo and video app company’s investors.User Growth Snap announced that daily active Snapchat users grew to 173 million, up from 166 million at the end of the first quarter. But the company fell short of Wall Street user projections. On top of that, Facebook-owned Instagram and its Stories feature, a copy of Snapchat’s tool with the same name, boasts 250 million daily active users.Snapchat’s user growth has been solid in the U.S., but international user additions have proved to be much harder to come by. Snap has experienced trouble with its Android app, which is a problem as the operating system is very popular outside of the U.S.Bottom LineThe company’s stock price has slowly declined since going public earlier this year. Snap is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and scored an “F” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Some big investors dumped the faltering social media company, while others added to their positions. On a day like today, it is hard to pin down what direction Snap’s stock price is headed. But, if Snapchat’s user growth doesn’t kick into a higher gear amid all of the news that constantly surrounds the disappearing content app, everything else might prove to be white noise.Want to know more about Snap and another young, struggling company?

63,BLK,"Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of around 6% for second-quarter 2017, marking the ninth straight quarter of earnings beat. Earnings per share of 53 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and improved 3.9% year over year.The results were driven by lower expenses and considerable improvement in non-operating income. However, decline in revenues and assets under management (AUM) were the undermining factors.Net income for the quarter came in at $53.5 million, up 1% year over year.Revenues and Costs DeclineTotal revenue for the second quarter declined 5% year over year to $272.8 million. Further, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $277.4 million.The decline in revenues can mainly be attributed to decreased revenues from lower average money market assets and a reduction in revenue resulting from a change in a customer relationship. It was partially offset by reduced voluntary fee waivers related to money market funds and increased revenues from higher average equity assets.In addition, net service fees increased 19% year over year to $47.4 million. However, administrative service fees were down 14% to $45.6 million. Also, net investment advisory fees declined 7% to $179.3 million.During the reported quarter, Federated derived 40% of its revenues from money market assets and the remaining 60% from equity and fixed-income assets.Further, supported by a 256% rise in net investment income to $3.9 million, the company recorded a spectacular improvement in non-operating income from the year ago quarter.Total operating expenses declined 5% year over year to $188.6 million. Less expenses primarily exhibit a decrease in compensation and related expenses, resulting from lower incentive compensation and a decrease in distribution expenses.Assets and AUMFederated witnessed equity assets of $65.8 billion, up 6% year over year. Additionally, fixed-income assets grew 4% year over year to $52.5 billion.As of Jun 30, 2017, total AUM was $360.4 billion, down 2% year over year.

65,BLK,"Amid the ongoing debate over the role of Wall Street in promoting gun safety, many financial companies are taking serious measures by reviewing and making changes in their business relationship with gun manufacturers and retailers.  Recently, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), in a notice posted on its website, announced the launch of new funds and index-tracking products that exclude gun manufacturers and retailers. This means that retailers – Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Dick's Sporting Goods and Kroger – (that have limited their sale of firearms to customers aged 21 or more) will not be part of the newly launched products.Also, the three largest U.S. publicly traded gun companies — Sturm Ruger (RGR  -  Free Report), American Outdoor Brands (AOBC  -  Free Report) and Vista Outdoor (VSTO  -  Free Report) — will not be part of these funds and products.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will be reducing expenses for funds tracking a socially responsible investing index (those already excludes these stocks) by 50% to 25 basis points.   (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Notably, following the deadly school shooting in Florida in February, several financial firms started reviewing their ties with the firearm industry and National Rifle Association. In fact, BlackRock was one of the first financial companies to go public with its intention to engage in discussion with gun makers and retailers regarding business policies and practices related to the production and sale of firearms last month.Further, in late March, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) became the first major Wall Street bank to announce changes relating to how it will conduct business with gun retailers. The bank, in an email statement, said that new policy retailers must sell firearms only to customers above 21 years of age and they must have passed a background check. Also, these retailers should not sell “bump stocks” or high-capacity magazines.Bank of America, State Street, Vanguard Group, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and Blackstone are among the companies that have spoken against the gun culture, but so far haven’t come out with similar plans. Also, U.S. public pension funds are under pressure to divest from gun manufacturers.Another Wall Street giant, Well Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), doesn’t wish to wade into gun control debate. Last month, in an interview to the Charlotte Observer, the company CEO, Tim Sloan said that he has doubts over whether banks should get more involved. Per a Bloomberg report, Well Fargo is the top financier for the gun industry.Amid all these, the comptroller of New York state’s pension funds, in a letter to nine major financial companies, have asked whether gun purchase should be classified with other risky transactions like illicit drugs and cryptocurrencies. These firms include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, First Data Corp., Worldpay Inc. and Mastercard.

66,BLK,"BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report) has fallen victim to the recent market downturn, but that doesn’t mean its run as an investment powerhouse will be over anytime soon. In fact, BlackRock stock has outperformed its industry for nearly a decade on its way to becoming one of the biggest investment firms in the world.BlackRock currently boasts $6.28 trillion in assets under management, most of which comes from passive investments such as mutual funds and ETFs—including its well-known iShares brand. The firm can attribute some of its success to the overall growth of the passive investment sector, which is expected to expand going forward.With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from BlackRock’s upcoming first quarter 2018 financial results to see if the passive investment giant looks poised to extend its current run. Latest Outlook and ValuationBlackRock’s Q1 revenues are expected to climb by 15.5% to reach $3.26 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is also projected to see its earnings surge by 23% to hit $6.46 per share.However, within the last 60 days, BlackRock has earned two earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the downside. These revisions lowered BlackRock’s consensus earnings estimate by 1 cent.Heading into its soon-to-be-reported quarter, BLK is trading with a Forward P/E of 17.7. This marks a substantial premium compared to the “Financial - Investment Management” industry, which is currently trading at an average of 12.2x forward earnings.BlackRock investors have been willing to pay a premium for the stock over the last decade as the firm consistently rewards them by outperforming the larger industry.Latest ResultsLast year, BlackRock reported the strongest net inflows in company history, with $367 billion coming under the firm’s management. This figure includes $103 billion in the fourth quarter alone. The company also made further inroads in high growth international regions, including China.“iShares ETFs generated $245 billion of full-year net inflows, as an increasingly diverse set of institutional and retail clients are using ETFs for asset allocation and alpha generation,” BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink said in a company statement.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of BlackRock’s Q1 report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.BlackRock, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BlackRock, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteWe can see that BlackRock has posted mixed results over the last few years. It is also worth noting that BlackRock’s stock has performed somewhat inconsistently following the release of its quarterly earnings results.Bottom LinePast performance is clearly not a guarantee of future success. But we can see that even when BlackRock fails to match or top quarterly earnings estimates, its stock price eventually continues to climb—sometimes in the near-term. Furthermore, despite its recent dip, shares of BlackRock have surged nearly 36% over the last year.BlackRock is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and is set to report its first-quarter earnings results before the market opens on Thursday, April 12.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

However, it compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 58 cents.Results benefitted from a decline in operating expenses. However, lower revenues were a headwind. Also, despite higher gross sales, as well as a fall in net outflows during the quarter, assets under management (AUM) continued to decline. Nevertheless, a solid balance sheet position was a positive for the company.After considering some non-recurring items, net income attributable to Waddell & Reed totaled $23.3 million or 28 cents per share compared with nearly $33.7 million or 41 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues, Expenses & AUM DeclineOperating revenues for the quarter decreased 10.2% year over year to $286.7 million, reflecting a decline in all components.

80,BLK,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are anticipated on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management  (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report), Ameriprise Financial Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released results. Out of these, Blackstone Group and BlackRock missed estimates despite recording AUM growth, while T. Rowe Price and Ameriprise beat estimates.Notably, per our Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 are likely to be up 7.7%.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s take a look at the investment management stocks that are scheduled to release quarterly numbers on Jul 28.Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 (ended Jun 30) results before the opening bell. Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for Jun 2017, the upcoming release will display higher assets under management on a year-over-year basis. Franklin’s cost-control efforts should support bottom-line growth to some extent.  Notably, management expects expenses in fiscal 2017 to remain flat or decline slightly, considering the impact of previous cost-cutting initiatives.In addition, we believe that the company’s top line will likely get support from its diversified portfolio offerings, as well as global presence (read more: Franklin to Post Q3 Earnings: A Surprise in the Cards?).Moreover, our proven quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Further, the reported figure came in line with the prior-year quarter.Top-line strength and growth in assets under management (AUM) were positives.

On a GAAP basis, Lazard’s net income came in at $109 million or 82 cents per share compared with $113 million or 85 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsIn the third quarter, adjusted operating revenues came in at $627.3 million, up 3% year over year. The upsurge can chiefly be attributed to an increase in asset management revenues. Moreover, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $589 million.Adjusted operating expenses were around $464.9 million in the quarter, up 3.3% year over year. Higher compensation and benefits, and non-compensation expenses led to the upsurge.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense flared up 3% on a year-over-year basis to $354.4 million.

The decline was primarily due to decrease in revenues from strategic advisory, partially offset by higher restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenues were $315.5 million, up 19% from the prior-year quarter. Higher management, incentive and other fees led to this rise.Corporate: The segment generated total revenues of $6 million, which increased significantly from the prior-year quarter.Strong Assets Under Management (AUM)As of Sep 30, 2017, AUM was recorded at $238 billion, up 16% year over year.

84,BLK,"Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of around 6% for third-quarter 2017, marking the tenth straight quarter of earnings beat. Earnings per share of 56 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents and improved 4% year over year.The results were driven by lower expenses and increase in assets. Strong liquidity position was a tailwind.

Further, the figure declined 6% year over year.The decline can mainly be attributed to decreased revenues from lower average money market assets and a reduction in revenues resulting from a change in customer relationship. It was partially offset by reduced voluntary fee waivers related to money market funds and increased revenues from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.Net service fees increased 7% year over year to $45.6 million. However, administrative service fees were down 11% to $47.5 million. Also, net investment advisory fees declined 6% to $184.9 million.During the reported quarter, Federated derived 40% of its revenues from money market assets and the remaining 60% from equity and fixed-income assets.Non-operating income dropped 20% year over year to $2.3 million due to lower net investment and other income.Total operating expenses declined 8% year over year to $189.6 million. Lower expenses primarily exhibit a decrease in compensation and related costs, resulting from drop in incentive compensation and lower distribution expenses related to fall average money market fund assets and a change in customer relationship.Assets and AUMFederated witnessed equity assets of $67.1 billion, up 5% year over year. Additionally, fixed-income assets grew 2% year over year to $52.8 billion.As of Sep 30, 2017, total AUM was $363.7 billion, down slightly year over year.

Earnings of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, results compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents per share.Top-line strength and growth in assets under management (AUM) were recorded.

Further, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion.Total operating revenues increased slightly year over year, to $1.62 billion in the quarter, mainly due to higher investment management and other fees, mostly offset by lower sales and distribution fees and shareholder servicing fees. Yet, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 billion.Investment management fees inched up 1% year over year to $1.11 billion, while sales and distribution fees were down 4% year over year to $421.8 million.

Furthermore, distribution and service fees were down 14.6% year over year to $80.7 million.Operating expenses inched up 1% to $623.9 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher other expenses, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses, distribution and servicing costs, and occupancy expenses.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 24.9%, up from 22.7% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Solid Assets PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, Legg Mason’s AUM was $754.4 billion, up 2.9% year over year from $732.9 billion.

90,BLK,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are expected on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released their results. Out of these, Blackstone Group and BlackRock have missed estimates despite recording AUM growth, while T. Rowe Price beat estimates.Notably, per our Earnings Preview report, overall earnings for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 are expected to be up 6.7%.Let’s take a look at the three major investment management stocks that are scheduled to release their results on Jul 27.Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) is set to announce its results after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents for the company for the upcoming release indicates a year-over-year decline of about 6.29%. However, Federated’s activities during the quarter were enough to win analysts’ confidence, as is evident from two positive revisions in earnings estimates (versus one negative revision) over the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the same time frame.Moreover, our proven quantitative model does not conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.

91,BLK,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) industry performed reasonably well over the past several quarters. This time as well, the industry is expected to report decent results.As the equity market volatility remained low, increase in equity-based assets is expected. While the S&P 500 Index gained 3.1% in the quarter, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are expected to record a rise in equity asset under management (AUM).Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, as they aggressively market their products, is expected to slightly hurt the bottom line.Notably, per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings growth for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 is expected to be 6.9%.So, this is the right time to add a few investment management stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

92,BLK,"Shares of The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) lost nearly 2% in pre-market trading, following the release of the company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings. Economic net income (ENI) of 59 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. However, the figure compared favorably with 44 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.An increase in expenses was the primary reason for the lower-than-expected results. However, the quarter witnessed a rise in revenues. Also, growth in assets under management (AUM) continued to impress.For the quarter, Blackstone reported ENI of $705.4 million, reflecting an increase 36% year over year.Revenues & Costs RiseTotal revenue (GAAP basis) increased 30% year over year to $1.55 billion, primarily driven by a rise in performance fees as well as interest and dividend revenues. Also, the top line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 billion.Total expenses (GAAP basis) increased 24% year over year to $885.1 million. The increase was primarily due to a drastic increase in fund expenses.Fee-earning AUM grew 6% year over year to $281.9 billion. Total AUM amounted to $371.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, up 4% year over year. The rise in total AUM was largely driven by $57.4 billion of inflows.As of Jun 30, 2017, Blackstone had $5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and corporate treasury investments.Our ViewpointBlackstone remains well positioned to capitalize on the changing investment landscape by making long-term investments and augmenting its fund-raising abilities.

(BLK  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39. Lower-than-expected results were primarily due to a rise in operating expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, along with growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as tailwinds.Among other investment managers, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

93,BLK,"BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share in the second quarter of 2017, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39 and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter. A solid improvement in assets under management (AUM) seems to have spurred the earnings beat (read: Why Bank ETFs Fell on Friday Despite Decent Earnings?).The company witnessed strong inflows during the quarter. ETF investors should be happy to know that BlackRock’s assets under management surpassed $5.68 trillion at the end of second-quarter 2017 (up 16%), mainly due to soaring sales of its iShares exchange traded funds. It managed to attract $104 billion of inflows into its funds in the second quarter, as per an article published on Financial Times.Though the world’s largest asset manager’s revenues increased 6% year over year to $2.97 billion. The rise was due to increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, and technology and risk management revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.What Led to BlackRock’s Strong ETF Inflows BlackRock entered into the battle of fee cuts in recent times having slashed expense fees for some of its iShares ETFs. It is being said that the company took the step to provide tough competition to other low-cost players like Vanguard and Schwab (read: 6 ETF Trends Likely to Take Centre Stage in 2017).For example, BlackRock lowered fees for its S&P 500 tracking ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV  -  Free Report), from 0.07% to 0.04%. The fee cut made IVV less expensive than other popular ETFs in its domain. Other two popular S&P 500 ETFs namely SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO  -  Free Report) charge 9 bps and 5 bps respectively (read: Buy These ETFs as BlackRock Cuts Fees).Most interestingly, despite the fee cut, BlackRock has managed to maintain its adjusted operating margin at 43.9%, or equal to the same period last year, as per FT.com. Overall, the iShares family of exchange-traded funds, which track almost all the key indexes, hold the key to BlackRock’s success (read: BlackRock Slashes Fees, ETF Price War Intensifies).ETFs in focusLet’s take a look at Q2 inflows (as per etf.com) for some iShares ETFs that have undergone fee cuts lately.iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) – $10.85 billioniShares Core S&P Total Stock Market ETF (ITOT  -  Free Report)– $1.39 billioniShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH  -  Free Report) – $423.6 millioniShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR  -  Free Report) – $135.0 millioniShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS  -  Free Report) – $1.25 billioniShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA  -  Free Report) – $6.07 billioniShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG  -  Free Report) – $4.36 billioniShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG  -  Free Report) – $3.73 billionWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It’s All About EarningsGiven the stock market’s record run this year, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on quarterly earnings.  This could be an excellent earnings season for the S&P 500, which in turn will boost its operating earnings per share for the trailing 12 months. Improved second-quarter economic growth, strong manufacturing and service surveys, and a moderate uptick in wage growth are expected to help Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2. Earnings growth is expected to be led by energy, financials and information technology (read more: Wall Street to See Terrific Q2 Earnings: 5 Top Gainers).According to estimates, total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 6.6% from same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth of 13.3% in Q1 on 7% revenue growth, the highest in at least two years. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, further added that history shows the final tally will be better in Q2 “as actual EPS exceeded initial estimates in each of the last 21 quarters and have done so by an average of 3.6 percentage points.”If we move beyond Q2, total earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are anticipated to increase 6.1% on 4.5% higher revenues in Q3 and gain by 9.7% on 5.2% higher revenues in Q4. For the entire year, total earnings for the index are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.1% higher revenues. This will be way more than 1% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues recorded last year (read more: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight).Meanwhile, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) quarterly profit came in below expectations. BlackRock reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39.

95,BLK,"Well, you wouldn’t know it from this morning’s pre-market atmosphere, but we are embarking on the first of three weeks of a heavy flood of Q2 earnings results. We’re starting out slow today, following Friday morning’s marquee bank reports, but will pick up steam as the week rolls along — Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) reports tomorrow morning, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and others will release earnings results later this week.Investment firm Blackrock (BLK  -  Free Report) missed analyst estimates this morning, posting earnings of $5.24 per share, lower than the $5.39 expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues were in-line at $2.97 billion, representing growth of 5% year over year. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company — its rating prior to the earnings report — is trading down 2.82% in the pre-market thus far.After the bell today we expect results from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #2 stock. The company has beaten the Zacks consensus over the past 4 quarters by a whopping 118%, and currently is expected to bring in 16 cents per share on $2.76 billion in quarterly sales. Subscriber counts will be the key number beneath the headline today, and we will provide coverage on this earnings result in real time this afternoon.Peltz Fighting for Seat at P&GNelson Peltz, the outspoken CEO and co-founder of Trian Fund Management — the Park Avenue asset management firm — is actively pursuing a seat on the board of consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) this morning, likely in an effort to kick-start the sluggish growth trajectory of the $220 billion market-cap company. This sort of “proxy war” is usually reserved for companies much smaller than P&G, so how this transpires is anyone’s guess at this point. But we expect this to be a noteworthy battle as the activist investor tilts at this enormous windmill. Trian currently owns about $3.5 billion of P&G stock.

96,BLK,"Shares of  BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), which are trading close to their 52-week high with a year-to-date gain of about 15%, might test highs post the company’s second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 17. That’s because year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings is expected this time.Moreover, BlackRock is very likely to beat earnings estimates this time around. The company topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, BlackRock has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.19%.

Price and EPS Surprise BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteFactors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsBlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its brand initiatives. Moreover, driven by a rise in equity inflows in the second quarter, the company’s U.S. iShares inflows remained strong. This might have strengthened its assets under management.The New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically. Thus, the average fee rate is likely to rise, driven by higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions.However, higher expenses could be a dampening factor. BlackRock has witnessed rising expenses over the last few years. Its plans of restructuring traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings might lead to an increase in expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s activities encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter inched up 1.5% to $5.37 in the last seven days.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Franklin Resources, Inc.

97,BLK,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because BlackRock is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BLK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.38 per share for BLK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.37 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BLK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.19% heading into earnings season.BlackRock, Inc. Price and Consensus  BlackRock, Inc. Price and Consensus | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that BLK has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

98,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 16, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 2.6%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.64 has decreased marginally over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 26.7%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company to gain 15.6% in the past year, outperforming 2.6% growth recorded by the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q2 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q2 results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter under review. Thus, while negative foreign currency adjustments during the second quarter might have an unfavorable impact on AUM, total AUM is expected to improve, driven by steady inflows. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.44 trillion, which reflects rise of 1.9%, sequentially.Supported by the increase in assets during the to-be-reported quarter, investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, is also expected to witness an improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.03 billion, reflecting 13.4% increase year over year.Moreover, performance fees, which is also a major revenue component, is expected to improve during the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the second quarter is $76 million, which represents an improvement of 58.3% from the prior-year quarter.However, consensus estimates for advisory and other revenues show that this component is likely to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $72 million, which reflects a decline of 1.4% year over year.Thus, while advisory and other revenues are expected to decline, an improvement in the major components of revenues is likely to boost the company’s total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the second quarter is $3.45 billion, which reflects growth of 16.4% year over year.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to further rise in expenses.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted whether BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because, it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 17.

The new employees will be divided among its Paris, Milan, Madrid, Dublin and Amsterdam offices. Moreover, it will employ 150 people for its Frankfurt office. Citi has appointed Gregoire Haemmerle to head its French corporate and investment banking unit, while to lead French M&A division, Pierre Drevillon has been hired.Many other companies are making alternate arrangements to ensure business continuity post-Brexit.

100,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) has been expanding its business globally through a series of acquisitions. The company has also taken initiatives to restructure its actively managed equities business. However, continued increase in expenses will likely hurt bottom- line growth to some extent.In April 2018, BlackRock announced that it has signed a deal to acquire Tennenbaum Capital, while in November 2017 its announced a transaction to buy Citibanamex’s Asset Management business in Mexico. Over the years, the company has acquired several firms across the globe, expanding its footprint. Therefore, its strong global presence along with broad product diversification, revenue mix and steadily improving assets under management will likely further boost revenues.Moreover, gradual improvement in the market conditions, efforts to strengthen its iShares and ETF operations and increased focus on active equity business will likely further aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s revenue growth, which saw a CAGR of 6% between 2012 and 2017.Looking at the company’s price performance, its shares have gained 16.4% in the past year, outperforming 4.8% rally of the industry.The company’s operating costs have witnessed a CAGR of 4.4% over the last six years (ending 2017), with the same trend continuing in the first three months of 2018. Rise in compensation and marketing costs are expected to keep expenses high, going forward.However, Blackrock’s global presence has increased its dependence on overseas revenues in the last few years. Despite generating just about one-third of  revenues from overseas markets, a number of risks stemming from regulatory and political environment, foreign exchange fluctuations and performance of regional economy can negatively affect its top-line growth.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has declined slightly to $27.94 whereas for the next year, it has increased marginally to $30.90 in the last 30 days.Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are America First Multifamily Investors, L.P (ATAX  -  Free Report), Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

101,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings have been upgraded from A1 to Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service. While the company’s short-term issuer rating has been affirmed at P-1, its rating outlook has been changed to stable from positive.Rationale Behind Rating UpgradeBlackRock continues to be a technology leader in the asset management industry. Its strong global presence, broad product diversification, revenue mix and steadily improving assets under management (AUM) are expected to boost its revenues.Moreover, BlackRock holds a strong market position, given its continued investment in U.S. iShare core ETFs. This investment will continue to drive growth across a broader range of iShares precision exposures in the near term.Further, BlackRock holds a competitive advantage over its peers, as with the help of Aladdin platform, it can quickly adapt to changes in the industry. The company is using the platform to build new revenue streams, increase fund sales while improving its active management business.In fact, its investment in U.S. iShare ETFs is also likely to drive growth across its active business in the future.Notably, BlackRock’s inorganic growth efforts also seem impressive. The company has expanded largely via acquisitions — both domestic and overseas. In the recent past, it announced deals to acquire Tennenbaum Capital and Citibanamex’s Asset Management business in Mexico. In 2017, it acquired First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds and Cachematrix while buying Bank of America's Money-Market Fund Business in 2016. These deals, along with the previous ones, are expected to help the company strengthen its revenue base further.In fact, the company’s inorganic growth strategies have contributed to most of its AUM growth, depicting a six-year CAGR of 10.6% (2012-2017).Additionally, with the decrease in tax obligations after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the company’s cash flow position has also improved.Thus, on the basis of the abovementioned positives, long-term ratings of the company have been upgraded.What Can Drive Ratings Up?A further upgrade in ratings is possible if the company’s scale i.e. revenue less distribution costs approaches $18 billion. If the industry adoption of Aladdin continues to rise or total debt/EBITDA ratio remains below 0.8 times, it can also result in an upgrade.What Can Lead to Ratings Downgrade?A rating downgrade could occur if the company fails to successfully convert AUM growth to revenue growth or if its passive products deteriorate because of any market event or a revival in the use of active management strategies. Ratings can also be downgraded if the company’s scale drops to less than $10 billion or if the leverage is sustained above 1.5 times EBITDA.In the past year, BlackRock’s shares have rallied 26%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.7%.Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (FFKT  -  Free Report), Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) and Lazard Ltd (LAZ  -  Free Report).In the last 60 days, Farmers Capital witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 5.9% for the current year.

Also, the bottom line was 47% above the prior-year quarter’s tally.Higher revenues and growth in assets under management (AUM) supported the results.

This upside was mainly driven by higher management fees and other revenues. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $417 million.Total expenses increased 14% from the prior-year quarter to $285.6 million, largely due to higher compensation and related costs, fund-related expenses and distribution expenses.Total operating income jumped 25% year over year to $135.8 million.Liquidity Position Strong, AUM ImprovesAs of Jan 31, 2018, Eaton Vance had $533.3 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $610.6 million as of Oct 31, 2016. Further, the company had no borrowings outstanding against its new $300 million credit facility.Eaton Vance’s consolidated AUM increased 24% from the year-ago quarter to $449.2 billion, reflecting net inflows of $37.1 billion and a market price appreciation of $48.4 billion.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, Eaton Vance repurchased nearly 0.7 million shares of its Non-Voting Common Stock for $36.3 million under its existing repurchase authorization.Our ViewpointEaton Vance’s improving AUM along with revenue rise are likely to support its growth in the quarters ahead.

104,BLK,"Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 31) results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from increase in revenues supported by its strategic initiatives and a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, higher expenses will likely offset the positives to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is 71 cents, up 34% year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses.Also, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters. Thus, its average earnings surprise was a negative 3.5%.Further, the company’s shares have rallied 14.5% for the three month-ended Jan 31, 2018, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.8%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Eaton Vance beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +2.24%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, AUM is projected witness an improvement during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be $443 billion, up 5% sequentially.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness improvement as outflows from higher fee strategies will likely decrease. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $417 million shows 17.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative is likely to lead to a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the United States might result in higher marketing expenses.Further, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Therefore, overall expenses are expected to trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the same space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

105,BLK,"T. Rowe Price Group (TROW  -  Free Report) is taking steps to base its European operations in Luxembourg post Brexit, per a Financial Times article.The investment companies are putting their plans into action after the European Commission warned the U.K.-based fund companies that they could be banned from selling products in the European Union (EU) from April 2019.Recently, the company applied to the Luxembourg’s financial regulator to separate its U.K. and Luxembourg operations.The decision to move operations from London to Luxembourg was taken in 2017 and Robert Higginbotham, head of global investment services at T.Rowe Price, expects the new unit to be ready by summer this year.The asset manager already has European operations in Madrid, Milan, Zurich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Higginbotham expects EU offices to be able to report to the Luxembourg entity by the end of 2018.The shifting of operations would not affect jobs in the United Kingdom, while new positions would be available in Luxembourg.Financial Times quoted Higginbotham, “All this is based on what we know about Brexit at the moment — which will probably be about 25 per cent of what we know in a year’s time. We have been working on this for a year and will have to get it complete by the end of the year.”  T.Rowe Price is not the only asset manager that is weighing up its Brexit contingency plans. Per an EY survey that involved about 55 asset and wealth managers, overseeing a combined investment of €25 trillion, half are working on or planning to expand their European operations in an attempt to protect themselves from the impacts of Brexit.T.Rowe Price’s organic growth remains impressive as can be seen from a continuous rise in revenues.

Moreover, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 26.2% and 10.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Further, its long-term (three to five years) expected EPS growth of 13.1% promises reward for shareholders.Revenue Strength: Driven by a solid global presence that allows broad diversification and organic growth, BlackRock’s revenues (on GAAP basis) witnessed a six-year CAGR of 6% (2012-2017). Also, the top line is anticipated to grow nearly 11.8% in 2018, higher than the industry average of 6.9%.

108,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) seeks to raise about $10 billion from various sovereign-wealth funds, pensions and other big investors, as part of a new business strategy that involves buying and holding stakes in companies. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The move is similar to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (BRK.B  -  Free Report) investment strategy. However, unlike Warren Buffett, who started buying whole companies, this new fund will target on taking only minority stakes in companies and then hold them for a long period of time.According to people familiar with the matter, this new investment vehicle is being called BlackRock’s “Long-Term Private Capital.""Notably, the investments made from this fund will be chaired by Mark Wiseman, whom the company had hired from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2016, to run its global active equity business. Also, management of the daily activities will be done by André Bourbonnais, the former chief executive officer of Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, according to the people familiar with the matter.The new venture may position BlackRock to compete with various Wall Street private equity giants like Carlyle Group LP, Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report) and its former holding company, The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report).Being one of the largest asset managers, with assets under management of almost $6.3 trillion as of Dec 31, 2017, BlackRock already manages various publicly offered mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds for its investors. However, till now, it did not have a separate fund of its own that would be used to buy stakes in other companies.Moreover, BlackRock seems well positioned for growth in the future, given its strong global presence, broad product diversification, solid revenue mix and efforts to strengthen the iShares and ETF operations.Shares of the company have gained 35% in 2017, outperforming the 31.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the figure represents a year-over-year increase of 26%.Results benefitted from a rise in revenues along with lower expenses. Also, growth in assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) were on the positive side.After taking into consideration several significant items, net income for the reported quarter came in at $393 million or $2.50 per share, up from $335 million or $1.97 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Increase, Expenses DeclineNet revenue (on a GAAP basis) was $2.99 billion, reflecting an increase of 4% from the year-ago quarter.

111,BLK,"Monday, July 17th, 2017Well, you wouldn’t know it from this morning’s pre-market atmosphere, but we are embarking on the first of three weeks of a heavy flood of Q2 earnings results. We’re starting out slow today, following Friday morning’s marquee bank reports, but will pick up steam as the week rolls along — Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) reports tomorrow morning, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and others will release earnings results later this week.Investment firm Blackrock (BLK  -  Free Report) missed analyst estimates this morning, posting earnings of $5.24 per share, lower than the $5.39 expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues were in-line at $2.97 billion, representing growth of 5% year over year. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company — its rating prior to the earnings report — is trading down 2.82% in the pre-market thus far.After the bell today we expect results from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #2 stock. The company has beaten the Zacks consensus over the past 4 quarters by a whopping 118%, and currently is expected to bring in 16 cents per share on $2.76 billion in quarterly sales. Subscriber counts will be the key number beneath the headline today, and we will provide coverage on this earnings result in real time this afternoon.Peltz Fighting for Seat at P&GNelson Peltz, the outspoken CEO and co-founder of Trian Fund Management — the Park Avenue asset management firm — is actively pursuing a seat on the board of consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) this morning, likely in an effort to kick-start the sluggish growth trajectory of the $220 billion market-cap company. This sort of “proxy war” is usually reserved for companies much smaller than P&G, so how this transpires is anyone’s guess at this point. But we expect this to be a noteworthy battle as the activist investor tilts at this enormous windmill. Trian currently owns about $3.5 billion of P&G stock.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

112,BLK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39. However, the bottom line came in 10% higher than the year-ago quarter.Lower-than-expected results were primarily due to a rise in operating expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, along with growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as tailwinds.Net income (on a GAAP basis) came in at $857 million, up 9% from the prior-year quarter.Revenue Growth Offsets Rise in ExpensesRevenues (GAAP basis) increased 6% year over year to $2.97 billion. The rise was due to increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, and technology and risk management revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Total expenses amounted to $1.72 billion, up 6% year over year. This was due to a rise in all cost components except amortization of deferred sales commissions and stable amortization of intangible assets, which witnessed a fall.Non-operating income (on a GAAP basis) came in at $1 million as against Non-operating expense $25 million in the year-ago quarter.BlackRock’s adjusted operating income came in at $1.25 billion, up 6% year over year.Strong AUM & InflowsAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM totaled $5.7 trillion, up 16% year over year. Further, during the reported quarter, the company witnessed long-term net inflows of $94.5 billion.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, BlackRock repurchased shares worth $275 million.Our ViewpointBlackRock remains well poised for opportunistic acquisitions, supported by a strong liquidity position.

115,BLK,"BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $5.92 per share in the third quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 and improving 15% from the year-ago quarter. A solid improvement in assets under management (AUM) seems to have spurred the earnings beat.The company witnessed strong inflows during the quarter. ETF investors’ contributions were huge to take BlackRock’s assets under management to around $6 trillion at the end of third-quarter 2017 (up 17%), mainly due to soaring sales of its iShares exchange traded funds. Assets under management for the ETF business were $1.640 trillion, making up about 27% of its total assets. BlackRock noted that its iShares exchange-traded funds business witnessed $52.3 billion in long-term net inflows, among which $33.1 billion was equity inflows.Revenues of BlackRock (GAAP basis) grew 14% year over year to $3.23 billion thanks to higher investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, technology and risk management revenues, and investment advisory performance fees. The reported figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.11 billion.What’s Behind Constant Success The world's largest asset manager has been making a kill for the last few quarters thanks to strong ETF inflows. BlackRock slashed expense fees for some of its iShares ETFs in recent times. It is being said that the company took the step to provide tough competition to other low-cost players like Vanguard and Schwab (read: 6 ETF Trends Likely to Take Centre Stage in 2017).For example, BlackRock lowered fees for its S&P 500 tracking ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV  -  Free Report), from 0.07% to 0.04%. The fee cut made IVV less expensive than another popular ETF – SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) – in its domain. The fund charges 9 bps in fees. However, yet another S&P 500-based ETF, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO  -  Free Report), also charges 4 bps in fees (read: Buy These ETFs as BlackRock Cuts Fees).Most interestingly, despite the fee cut, BlackRock has managed to see a 15% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income. Apart from fee cuts, honing in on active management business seems to be another cause of success. Management noted that assets under management for its scientific active equity group surged 86% in the third quarter from the year-ago period.Increased usage of big data and machine learning helped BlackRock to position its active business well.ETFs in focusLet’s take a look at Q3 inflows (as per etf.com) for some iShares ETFs that have undergone fee cuts in recent times.iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) – $6.30 billioniShares Core S&P Total Stock Market ETF (ITOT  -  Free Report) – $1.11 billioniShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR  -  Free Report) – $1.62 billioniShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS  -  Free Report) –$708.2 millioniShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA  -  Free Report) – $6.38 billioniShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG  -  Free Report) – $2.42 billioniShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG  -  Free Report) – $2.82 billionWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Notably, the full-day trading session will depict a better picture.Rise in revenues and growth in AUM from the prior-year quarter benefited the results. However, higher operating expenses and outflows were the undermining factors.Affiliated Managers’ economic net income was $215.2 million, an increase of 17.5% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues & Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 12.5% year over year to $612.4 million. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $592.4 million.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $286.5 million, up 17.5% from the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses increased 11.2% year over year to $435.4 million.

Full-year adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 improved 17% year over year. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.47. A solid improvement in assets under management (AUM) seems to have spurred the earnings beat.The company witnessed strong inflows during the quarter. ETF investors’ contributions were huge to take BlackRock’s assets under management to around $6.29 trillion at the end of fourth-quarter 2017 (up 22%), mainly due to soaring sales of its iShares exchange traded funds.Since BlackRock issued the iShares core funds five years ago, there have been more than $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows realized in 2017 alone and $55 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter (read: U.S. Listed ETFs Garner Record Inflows in 2017).Revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter came in at $3.47 billion, increasing 20% year over year.

BlackRock slashed expense fees for some of its iShares ETFs in recent times. It is being said that the company took the step to provide tough competition to other low-cost players like Vanguard and Schwab (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).For example, BlackRock lowered fees for its S&P 500 tracking ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV  -  Free Report), from 0.07% to 0.04%. The fee cut made IVV less expensive than another popular ETF – SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) – in its domain. The fund charges 9 bps in fees. However, yet another S&P 500-based ETF, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO  -  Free Report), also charges 4 bps in fees (read: Buy These ETFs as BlackRock Cuts Fees).ETFs in focusLet’s take a look at Q4 inflows (as per etf.com) for some iShares ETFs that have undergone fee cuts in recent times.iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) – $6.93 billioniShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA  -  Free Report) – $4.40 billioniShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG  -  Free Report) – $3.17 billioniShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG  -  Free Report) – $2.83 billioniShares Core S&P Total Stock Market ETF (ITOT  -  Free Report) – $701.1 millioniShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR  -  Free Report) –  $1.26 billion                iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS  -  Free Report) –$662.9 millionWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

The increase was primarily due to a higher compensation and related costs, and sub-advisory fees.Operating margin was 19%, down from 24.3% a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, AUM totaled $80.90 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.9% from the Sep 30, 2016 level.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents as well as investment securities totaled $923.1 million.

The company returned a total of $42.1 million to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.Further, as part of its regular assessment of the return of capital to stockholders, management intends to implement a revised capital return policy. This will give Waddell & Reed greater financial flexibility to invest in business, maintain a strong balance sheet and continue providing competitive return to stockholders.Therefore, the Board lowered the quarterly dividend on Class A common stock to 25 cents per share. This dividend will be paid on Feb 1, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Jan 11, 2018.Additionally, the company’s capital plan includes an authorization to repurchase $250 million worth shares over the next two years.Our ViewpointWaddell & Reed has been facing pressure on its revenues, which will continue to hamper its financials in the near term. A declining trend in AUM is another key concern. Although the company is taking initiatives through Project E to boost its top line, it will take a while to witness a rebound.Nevertheless, expenses remain manageable. Also, its continued investments in the Retail-Broker Dealer channel might help boost revenues and AUM, going forward.Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.

131,BLK,"Tuesday, October 10, 2017It’s being called the biggest proxy fight in history: activist investor an co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz, has been trying for months to attain a seat on Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) board of directors. The company has thus far disallowed the move, fearing disruption from high-profile Peltz. This morning — right now, in fact, P&G is putting it to a vote.No company remotely this large — P&G has a $235 billion market cap — has ever gone through this. Yet Trian routinely invests in big brand names, of which P&G has many — Charmin, Tide, Head & Shoulders and Downy, just to name a few. Trian itself owns interest in Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), among others, and just yesterday gained a seat on General Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) board. From Peltz’s perspective, this bid should be a slam-dunk. But the consumer discretionary giant has reportedly stated Peltz shouldn’t be granted a seat on the board “just because he can.”As an activist investor, Peltz has freely shared his opinion that P&G relies too heavily on its established products at the expense of innovation. P&G board members supporting CEO David Taylor, who took the reins not quite two years ago, are not taking kindly to Peltz’s forceful assertion that he should be given the seat. Thus we find ourselves in this current situation.Wall Streeters voting at P&G would tend to support Peltz’s entry to the board today. But 40% of P&G shareholders are retail, not insiders, and they would more likely be supporting the corporation’s status quo. At 1 P&G Plaza in Cincinnati, OH, the x-factor may be the index funds which swing the balance. Representatives from Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), and the like are considering whether to push P&G in a more aggressive direction under Peltz’s influence, or safeguard this staple corporation of Southern Ohio.P&G currently employs roughly 95K people worldwide. Should Peltz win himself a seat, many feel he would push to further consolidate its workforce, which has already been trimmed more than 25% since the company put its internal reforms into play five years ago. Pre-market trading for PG shares are up slightly, though the stock has traded down over the past month. That said, PG still trades up near all-time highs.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?
