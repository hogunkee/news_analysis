5,KLAC,"Chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) received a stock rating downgrade Friday over concerns about slower foundry investments in the second half of 2018.Needham analyst Edwin Mok lowered his rating on KLA-Tencor to hold from buy. He made the move after recent checks suggested an increased risk for slower 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer semiconductor equipment investments later this year.""While we like KLAC's longer-term prospects, we expect the foundry delays coupled with some memory push-outs to drive downside to consensus view in second-half calendar 2018 and limit near-term share price appreciation,"" Mok said in a report.KLA-Tencor is facing a situation similar to what happened in 2015 when foundries delayed investments in 16-nanometer and 10-nanometer technology. The stock came under pressure at that time, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseKLA-Tencor has outperformed peers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) recently because of its lower exposure to memory-chip manufacturing.

It slashed through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, both key support levels.The Milpitas, Calif.-based company would be impacted by spending cuts at customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Taiwan Semi is likely to reduce or even delay its 5-nanometer pilot factory line investment, based on channel checks. Also, Taiwan Semi is likely to slow the growth of its 7-nanometer capacity, Mok said.""Coupled with limited investments by the other leading foundries, we expect to see a smaller-than-expected foundry rebound in second-half 2018,"" Mok said.

6,KLAC,"This week's big planned Trump administration announcement of emergency investment and export rules targeting China is out, and it doesn't include any rules or even mention China. By now it should be clear that Trump is bending over backwards to soothe Beijing and avoid a China trade war.Instead of detailing tough new emergency measures, including a reported 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology, Trump will instead back legislation moving through Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.In a statement that never mentions China, Trump noted, ""certain countries direct and facilitate systematic investment in United States companies and assets in order to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property in industries those countries deem important.""Last week, Trump called members of Congress to the White House to stop them from interfering with his plan to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs at communications equipment firm ZTE put at risk by U.S. sanctions.Trump's moves appear designed to facilitate progress in trade negotiations ahead of a July 6 Trump tariff deadline that may dramatically intensify the emerging China trade war. On that date, the U.S. is to impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports, with tariffs on another $16 billion in goods due shortly thereafter. China has said it will match Trump tariffs dollar for dollar, whenever they are imposed.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all rallied early Wednesday on hopes that Trump's move to delay investment and export restrictions might keep the China trade war on the back burner. But they reversed sharply lower as the bond yield curve narrowed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Trump had been ""spooked"" by Monday's market sell-off, which helped spur the change in plans.Trump has already made clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would  ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy.Trump's latest decision could be a reprieve for the semiconductor sector. Chip equipment from key U.S. suppliers Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) was seen as one likely area for controlling exports. Chinese companies account for about 6% of the group's sales.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.On Tuesday, the House cleared the modernized CFIUS bill, which now will move to a conference merging it with a Senate-passed bill.Trump's statement said that ""such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE: Dow Jones Futures: 5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedStocks Strengthen In Afternoon; Netflix, Apple, Intuitive Surgical Lead Nasdaq 100Faster Than Concorde: Boeing Hypersonic Jet Concept Would Cross Atlantic In 2 HoursTesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

9,KLAC,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion.

Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

At 11,007, the sector index still holds a 3.7% gain since Jan. 1, but that now significantly trails a 7.3% year-to-date rise for the Nasdaq composite.At 2839, the S&P 500 boasts a 6.2% advance since Jan. 1 with four trading sessions left in January.The S&P SmallCap 600 led the day with a 0.4% lift. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq dropped from Wednesday's levels.Within the recreational vehicle industry group, Winnebago Industries (WGO) flashed a defense-type sell signal as shares dropped 4.35 points, or 8%, to 49.The leisure and transport stock play, a nice winner in 2017, slumped even further below the important 50-day moving average in volume that was 178% above the 50-day moving average.The 50-day moving average is an important tool for knowing when to sell and capture solid price gains in leading stocks. Drawn as a red line in IBD's daily charts, it traces the average closing price of a stock or an index over the past 50 trading sessions. Once a new trading day is completed, a new average close is computed and plotted on the chart; thus, the average is ""moving.""Healthy leading stocks hold above their 50-day moving averages. After a strong breakout, a mild pullback to or near the 50-day line (or the 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) for the first or second time offers a follow-on buy opportunity.Winnebago has rallied as much as 57% after breaking out of a long and deep cup with handle at 37.30 on Sept. 6 last year.Notice how Winnebago also gave an early sign of a potential change in character on Jan. 16 as the stock clipped its 50-day line in heavy volume. That was the first close below the mid-term support and resistance level since late August.Going back to Apple, watch to see how the largest company by market cap in the U.S. financial markets finishes for the week.For now, an 11.9% gain for the iPhone and digital services titan from an Oct. 27 breakout past a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 has been whittled down to 6.2%.One of the key sell rules in IBD investing: Don't allow a 10% or more gain in a stock to turn into a complete round trip.Plus, the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts, has been diving over the past five sessions. That's a bad sign, because a falling RS line means a stock is underperforming the S&P 500.The action by Apple, certain chip plays such as Broadcom (AVGO) and other Apple component suppliers, also hints at institutional money rotating a little bit more out of tech and into cyclical and commodity-focused sectors.Broadcom, a humongous winner since the 2009 major market bottom, dropped nearly 4% to 247.25 in steep volume and undercut its long-term 200-day moving average. In doing so, the diversified semiconductor giant also did a round trip of gains following an Oct. 30 breakout past a 259.46 buy point in a nine-week flat base.Broadcom reportedly is a major chip component supplier to Apple.Those with outsize gains in Apple, however, have the luxury to be patient and check whether institutional investors see the recent sell-off as a brand new opportunity to buy shares and shore up the stock. As seen in a weekly chart, Apple is trading only 1% below the 10-week moving average, which moves similarly with the 50-day line on a daily chart.Apple began its impressive run back on Jan. 6, 2017, when it rallied out of a bottoming base pattern. Back then, it formed an excellent cup with handle that presented a proper buy point at 118.12.Since then, Apple's fundamentals have greatly improved, and the company has even posted mild double-digit growth (EPS up 11%, 18% and 24% in the past three quarters, revenue up 12% in fiscal Q4).However, as reported by IBD tech writers, some analysts are concerned about the sales figures of Apple's latest flagship, the iPhone X.For now, the fiscal Q1 EPS estimate has not changed as Wall Street consensus is for earnings to rise 13% to $3.80 a share.Elsewhere, chip equipment leader KLA Tencor (KLAC) dropped nearly 2% to 113.16 after being up as much as 5.9% intraday. The stock's uptrend is still intact, but continued negative reversals in heavy turnover would indicate that some institutions are heavily taking profits.On Dec. 18, KLA bolted past a 110.11 buy point in a base on base, but the ride has been volatile.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, which are ranked by performance among 33 distinct industry sectors, the Chips sector has fallen in the rankings after being in one of the top 3 spots for a long time in 2017. As of Jan. 24, Chips are now ranked No. 10. (See the complete rankings by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, then click on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.)Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose nearly 1% to 1,686, gaining for a second straight session. But the fund still lies beneath its rising 50-day moving average. Shares are also still 52% below a 3,522 peak.Gold futures fell, sending the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF down 0.8% to 127.93 in double normal turnover. Watch to see if the popular exchange-traded fund can climb back above a recent breakout point at 128.42.In crude oil markets, near-term WTI futures dipped nearly 0.6% to $65.24 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on financial markets, high growth stocks, and breakouts.)RELATED:Finding Great New IPOs: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Cisco, Yahoo And Google?The Renewed Case For A Bull Run In GoldInside The Big Picture: This Commodity Broke OutHow To Discover The Next Major Stock Market Top: Here Is The Easy WayKnow This Key Sell Signal For Growth StocksFinding The Best Growth Stocks: Follow A Simple Routine

42,KLAC,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have been heavily buying shares in big-name industry leaders, including Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), investing well over $1 billion in each during that period.X BofA led the group, with top fund managers scooping up more than $2 billion of the financial giant's shares. Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

44,KLAC,"Semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers saw their shares jump on Wednesday after positive reports from ASML Holding (ASML) and Ichor Holdings (ICHR).X Dutch lithography gear specialist ASML on Wednesday delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and gave bullish commentary about the year ahead.Ichor, a provider of fluid delivery subsystems for chipmaking equipment, gave preliminary fourth-quarter results that topped views. Ichor shares soared nearly 20% to close at 30.66 Wednesday.Fremont, Calif.-based Ichor said it expects to post revenue of $183 million for the fourth quarter when it releases official results on Feb. 7. Analysts were modeling for $180 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.For the current quarter, Ichor guided to sales of $240 million to $250 million, with the midpoint of $245 million topping the consensus view of $207 million, Zacks said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently includes two chip-gear makers: Applied Materials and Lam Research.ASML shares jumped nearly 7% to finish at 199.18 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, ASML hit an all-time high of 201.20.Other chip-gear makers were on the move Wednesday as well. Applied Materials (AMAT) surged 5.2% to 57.34, and Lam Research (LRCX) leapt 7.7% to 205.08.Elsewhere, MKS Instruments (MKSI) jumped 5.8% to close at 103.30, and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) gained 5.4% to 113.49.And late Wednesday, Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) shares took off, soaring by more than 23% past the 27 mark in after-hours action.

Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected sales of $85 million.RELATED:3 Reasons To Be Wary Of Apple As Stock Retakes Buy Zone: S&P 500 FuturesApplied Materials, Lam Research Boosted By Upgrades; ASML Breaks OutChart Action For The Chip-Gear Stocks

45,KLAC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

46,KLAC,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point. Baker Hughes (BHGE) edged past earnings estimates and was upbeat on spending among its customers. But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc. Shares extended the sell-off from the prior week, when Ford's 2018 outlook disappointed investors. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) delivered strong results and generally affirmed ambitious 2018 financial targets, sending shares to a fresh 52-week high.New Oriental Education (EDU) logged 8% EPS growth, short of views, while a 37% sales gain to $467.2 million narrowly beat fiscal Q2 estimates. Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69. TD Ameritrade also said it will allow customers to buy and sell certain ETFs 24/7, five days a week. E-Trade reported Q4 EPS up 49% and revenue up 25% to $637 million. It'll also acquire one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial (COF) with about $18 billion in assets. Shares of both online brokers fell modestly for the week.Millennial-focused free investing app Robinhood will let people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with zero commission.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) reported adjusted income of $2.54 per share on $892 million in sales, rising a respective 25% and 18%. Both metrics topped expectations. But the robot-surgery gear maker gave cautious guidance.Homebuilder NVR (NVR) missed Q4 earnings and sales views. Shares tumbled 11%, crashing through its 10-week line for the first time in more than a year in huge volume. Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

47,KLAC,"Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose solidly Thursday morning after the Nasdaq composite slumped Wednesday on Apple (AAPL) and weakness in chips  fueled by Texas Instruments (TXN).Late Wednesday, chip-equipment giant Lam Research (LRCX) and chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) reported blowout earnings and bullish guidance, sending the stocks near or into buy zones overnight. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled on guidance that fell short of estimates.X S&P 500 index futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.45%.Apple shares fell 1.6% to 174.22 in Wednesday's stock market trading, dropping back below a 175.34 flat-base buy point. The stock did find support at its 50-day moving average, as it has since the last days of 2017. But volume was the highest since Nov. 3 and was the heaviest trade in a down session since September.Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, fell yet again. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Already at consolidation lows, Apple's RS line is now approaching longer-term levels. Apple's stock hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 for several months.Apple shares rose a fraction in early Thursday trading.A growing number of Apple analysts are warning of weak iPhone demand. Perhaps the bad news is being priced, or overpriced, into the stock ahead of earnings next week.Lam Research earned $4.34 a share in its fiscal second quarter excluding various items including a tax-related charge, up 94% vs. a year earlier and well above views for $3.69 according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 37% to $2.58 billion, just above analyst forecasts for $2.57 billion.For fiscal Q3 ending in April, Lam Research expects EPS of $4.20-$4.50 and revenue of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion. Wall Street was looking for EPS of $3.81 and revenue of $2.66 billion.Lam Research shares rose 4.7% to 219.50 in early Thursday trading after falling 2.5% to 209.73 on Wednesday. The stock had rallied in the prior six sessions.Lam's after-hours action suggests the stock could test its 219.80 cup-base buy point. Lam's RS line remains off its highs near the left side of the consolidation. But the RS line has made some progress, clearing some short-term highs.Lam's results follow strong earnings and a bullish outlook from ASML Holding (ASML) last week, as well as strong preliminary revenue figures and sales guidance from Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific (ESIO).KLA-Tencor (KLAC), which is at the edge of a buy zone, reports earnings Thursday.Xilinx earned 76 cents a share excluding various items and a tax-related charge, up 46% vs. a year earlier. That was the best gain in four years and easily beat fiscal third-quarter views for 63 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $631.2 million vs. views for $630 million. That's just OK, but is the best top-line growth in five quarters.For the current quarter, Xilinx sees revenue of $635 million to $665 million. That $650 million midpoint is above Wall Street forecasts and would be a 6.7% yearly gain.Xilinx rose 4.8% to 78 in premarket trading, suggesting a move back above a 75.24 buy point. Xilinx fell out of buy range on Wednesday, losing 2.7% to 73.48.The RS line is definitely a concern. It's well below the consolidation's high and hasn't made headway for the past year.

56,KLAC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Thursday morning after the major averages rebounded strongly Wednesday.X Apple (AAPL) moved into buy range for the third time in a month after announcing plans to repatriate nearly all of its ""overseas"" cash to the U.S. But volume was just so-so, Apple's relative strength line remains near recent lows, and iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) generally continue to struggle.Meanwhile, chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML) blasted past a buy point on strong earnings, while collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) moved firmly into a buy zone a day ahead of its quarterly report. Both ASML and Altassian moved in strong volume with encouraging gains in their RS lines, signaling the stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 indexS&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were a fraction above fair value.Apple announced plans to repatriate nearly all its overseas cash to take advantage of tax reform changes. The Dow industrials component will pay $38 billion in taxes, give a $2,500 bonus to employees, and boost its advanced manufacturing investment fund to $5 billion from $1 billion.Shares of Apple erased intraday losses to rally 1.65% to 179.10 in Wednesday's stock market trading, reclaiming a 176.34 flat-base buy point yet again, following one-day moves over that entry on Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. But the same three problems remain that should make investors wary.Volume: Apple's volume rose 12% above normal, which is actually a little better than the prior two moves into a buy zone. But the volume is well below the minimum 40%-50% above-average increase you'd like to see to reflect institutional buying.Relative strength: Apple's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is near the bottom of its recent consolidation, and Thursday's move didn't mark a big shift. Apple's 1.65% gain wasn't that much better than the S&P 500's 0.9%. Apple's RS line hasn't made much headway since May.IPhone ecosystem: If Apple's prospects are so strong, then why aren't iPhone chipmakers also breaking out, or at least making moves toward doing so? Broadcom is stuck below its 50-day moving average, while Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) are below their 50-day and 200-day lines. All three have lagging RS lines.Can Apple's low-volume, lagging-RS move into buy zone work? Sure, but the odds of big gains are lower, while the risks of failure are higher.The Dutch chip gear maker tried to clear a 186.47 cup-base entry on Tuesday, but with the market reversing lower ASML settled for a 3% rise to 186.38. On Wednesday, ASML gapped higher on a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue. Shares blasted past the entry point and traded part of the session in the 5% buy zone before closing up 6.9% to 199.18, slightly extended. Investors should look to see if ASML pulls back into the buy zone or, eventually, to its 50-day moving average for an entry point.ASML roared higher on triple normal volume. The stock's RS line moved above a recent consolidation, providing some confirmation of the bullish price action, while approaching the late-November peak.Another reason to be bullish about ASML: Unlike Apple chipmakers, several chip equipment makers made bullish moves and/or news. Ichor Holdings (ICHR) shot up 20% on strong preliminary revenue figures and bullish sales guidance, skyrocketing back above its 50-day line. After the close, Electro Scientific (ESIO) leapt more than 20% on its own bullish guidance, signaling a move toward a buy point.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) reclaimed a buy point in volume that was so-so: 22% above normal. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose strongly as they build the right side of bases.Even if none of these stocks looks as good as ASML, industry-group moves are important for even leading stocks.Atlassian, like ASML, also tried to break out on Tuesday, but closed below a 53.55 cup-base entry. On Wednesday, shares popped 3.9% to 54.87 in volume that was 69% above normal. The RS line is above a very short-term high and is making progress on reaching the highs of the left side of the consolidation.But Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday evening, with investors expecting a 33% EPS gain to 12 cents. Buying or holding a stock into earnings can be risky. Investors may want to consider adopting this earnings options strategy.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 5 Signs Why This Rally May Heat Up In 2018RS Line Flashes Different Signals For These Two BreakoutsChip-Gear Stocks Rock On Upbeat ASML, Ichor Reports

65,KLAC,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated modest gains at Monday's open following strong market gains last week. Investors will get a key reading on the U.S. economy Monday, with earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on tap following Friday's selloff in chip stocks.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 2.3%, its best showing since January, with the tech-heavy index hitting record highs. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET.

PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI) came in second with a 43.5% return.That was followed by a pair of First Trust funds: First Trust Emerging Markets Small Cap AlphaDEX (FEMS) and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index Fund (QTEC). Up next is Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), which has gathered $280.9 million in assets since its April 2015 launch.Most of these funds have pulled back recently.

72,KLAC,"Nasdaq 100 futures soared Friday morning after a wave of big earnings late Thursday. Megacap techs Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up sharply, with the two FANG stocks signaling likely buying opportunities. Chip plays Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also advanced. But Baidu (BIDU) was among several losers.XNasdaq 100 futures surged 1.35% above fair value. S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were up nearly 0.3%.During Thursday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 0.1%.Amazon earned 52 cents a share a share, obliterating views for just 1 cent. Revenue grew 34% to $43.7 billion, beating the consensus for $42 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue leapt 42% to $4.58 billion in Q3. AWS had operating profit of $1.171 billion vs. the companywide $347 million.Amazon shot up 7.4% to 1,044 in early trading. That suggests a high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average, which would offer a buying opportunity. However, the stock could find resistance below its old high of 1,083.31. Amazon is in a late-stage flat base with a potential entry of 1,083.41.  Keep in mind that overnight action doesn't always translate into how a stock will open or close the following session.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. If you owned Amazon, you're happy now, but Baidu holders seem headed for a big retreat. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Adjusted earnings climbed 32% from a year ago, with revenue jumping 24% to $27.77 billion. Both cleared earnings views.Google doesn't break out its cloud computing revenue, grouping it in ""other revenues,"" which rose 40% to $3.405 billion. Google executives touted cloud growth on its post-Q3 call. Google reached a deal with Cisco Systems (CSCO) this week to market its cloud-computing services to the enterprise market as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet shares rose 3.2% to 1,023.59 early Friday. That suggests the stock will retake a 1006.29 buy point briefly cleared earlier this month.Google gets most of its money from online advertising. So its gains there bode well for Facebook (FB), which will report earnings in early November. Facebook shares rose 1.7% to 173.49 in the premarket, trying to get back above a 175.59 entry.Microsoft earnings rose 17% to 84 cents a share, defying views for a dip to 72 cents. Revenue grew 12% to $24.54 billion. Microsoft said its Azure cloud-computing revenue shot up 90%, though it didn't give an actual dollar figure. The Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure and Windows Server, saw a 14% gain to $6.9 billion.""This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud (annualized revenue run rate), outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a  statement.Microsoft rose 4.6% to 82.38 early. The Dow tech titan's stock was already modestly extended from a breakout.Baidu appeared to deliver earnings that crushed third-quarter estimates. But the Chinese search giant, which is becoming a big leader in artificial intelligence, gave weak Q4 guidance. Baidu shares fell 8.8% to 237.65 in the premarket, signaling a move below its 50-day moving average. Baidu hasn't had a very long run and it's unclear how heavy the weekly volume will be, so this may not trigger a clear long-term sell signal.(During Thursday's session, Chinese for-profit education stocks Tal Education (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) did trip long-term sell signals, including high-volume sell-offs through their 10-week lines.)In addition to Baidu, Mattel (MAT) and Expedia (EXPE) were huge overnight losers while Cerner (CERN) and Fortinet (FTNT) also sold off following their quarterly reports.RELATED:Google Shoots To All-Time High After Beating Earnings ViewsAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarMicrosoft Tops September-Quarter Sales, Earnings TargetsBaidu Dives On Weak Revenue Forecast

The Google parent hailed its strong start to 2017, with earnings sprinting past views while revenue growth modestly topped.

But if the after-hours action holds true at the open, the stock is likely to be extended.Nasdaq futures would be even higher were it not for Dow components Microsoft and Intel. The one-time Wintel duo topped earnings views, but sales were a little light. Microsoft pared losses late to a fractional decline. But Intel sold off 4%.Semiconductor stocks have been hot, especially chip-equipment makers. But in addition to Intel, Skyworks (SWKS) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sold off late following their earnings reports.Meanwhile, Starbucks reported in-line earnings, but sales were light, with comparable sales in the Americas weak once again.

77,KLAC,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout.

Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings.

Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected.

The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

79,KLAC,"The highflying chip gear sector likely will face a near-term pullback, but the long-term outlook looks bright, an analyst reported Tuesday.Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in a report to clients that he expects sales of semiconductor wafer fab equipment, or WFE, to pull back 10% to 20% in the second half of 2017, but longer term the current growth cycle in the sector could extend to 2019. The current cycle started in early 2016.""We expect some near-term softness (in the semiconductor capital equipment industry) as we expect business to pull back after a series of sequential quarterly growth, but we are increasingly bullish for the long term,"" Mok said.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is ranked No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked. Several leading chip-gear stocks hit multiyear highs on Monday, including Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).""Historically, WFE stocks would decline 20%-plus on near-term softness, but we see a smaller pullback in the coming months as we expect investors who missed the recent run-up to become incremental buyers, picking up shares if they pull back,"" Mok said. ""Within our coverage, we highlight our Top Pick KLAC (strong buy).""Semiconductor capital equipment stocks are being helped by the shift to 3D chips from planar chips, he said.End markets for semiconductors are robust, Mok said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip industry stocks, including three chip gear makers: Advanced Energy Industries, Applied Materials and Lam Research.""With declining costs and ongoing performance improvements, semis are increasingly being deployed in new applications in markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, augmented/virtual reality, and artificial intelligence,"" Mok said. ""Moreover, the significant increase in digital content has led to data center investments to manage and store data, further bolstering demand for semis. We believe these trends will further expand overall semiconductor sales on top of demand from foundational markets such as PC, mobile and communication.""Needham rates Advanced Energy as buy with a price target of 70, Applied Materials as buy with a price target of 43, and KLA as strong buy with a price target of 105. Needham rates Lam and Teradyne as buy with price targets of 145 and 30, respectively.On the stock market today, Advanced Energy fell 1% to 66.46. Applied Materials sank 0.4% to 38.27, KLA-Tencor rose 1 cent to 92.87, Lam dipped 5 cents to 122.35 and Teradyne slipped 0.1% to 30.06.RELATED:Analog Devices, Marvell, ON Semi Get Price-Target HikesChip Gear Stocks Rocking As Investors Come Knocking

89,KLAC,"Electronics firms paced a sharp decline in the tech sector and the Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes on Tuesday, down 1.6%.Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to early data, signifying a new distribution day, or unusually heavy institutional selling.XThe Nasdaq composite gave back more than half of last week's stout 1.9% gain. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, at least five electronics-related groups sank 1.5% or more, including semiconductor equipment, fabless semiconductors, contract manufacturing and chipmaking.IBD'S TAKE: Which were the best 10 industry groups in the market today? And the 10 worst? See the price changes of all 197 industry groups by viewing the entire ""Industry Sub-Group Rankings,"" available at Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.The S&P 500 slipped nearly 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. A rebound in department store, home furnishings retailing, jewelry, discount and variety retail, consumer lending, superregional bank, oil field services and hospital stocks helped cushion the blow.Investor demand for banks rose as the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond jumped 6 basis points to 2.20%. The sharp sell-off in bond prices came on the back of comments by Fed chief Janet Yellen that appeared to favor additional interest-rate hikes this year.The Dow utility average, also sensitive to interest rates, caved almost 1.4%. At 720.66, the sector gauge is still up an impressive 9.2% since Jan. 1.Investors who are sitting on large gains in the semiconductor sector need to keep a hawklike eye on sell signals or other indications that these leaders are ready to take a significant break.Lam Research (LRCX), KLA Tencor (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML Holding (ASML) are all leaders in the Chips sector, which through Monday's close ranked second among 33 IBD broad sectors; Electronics took the top spot.Lam, a member of the IBD 50, dropped more than 2.9% to 144.62 in heavy volume. The supplier of systems for wafer etching and cleaning slid further below its rising 50-day moving average. The undercut of the key support line is Lam's first significant move below that line since late April of 2016.Given Lam's big run over the past year, it's sensible now to take at least partial gains.Lam initially broke out of a long first-stage saucer-with-handle base at 83.61 in June 2016. After a slow start, the large-cap tech began to accelerate its gains and show heavy turnover in July through October of the same year. At its recent peak of 167.05, Lam gained as much as 99%.KLA, meanwhile, is also issuing a sell signal as it fell even further below its 50-day line. Shares dropped more than 2% to 93.8 and are now 14% off the 52-week peak of 109.59.Applied Materials, the $45 billion large-cap leader in IBD's semiconductor equipment group, also took out its 50-day moving average with a nearly 3% loss to 41.89 in volume that grew 25% above normal levels. ASML, down 1% to 132.37, is also testing its 50-day line.In IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group, Coherent (COHR) slid nearly 5% to 225.68 in fast turnover and gouged its 50-day line for the first time since October 2016. In the fabless semiconductor industry group, Broadcom (AVGO) fell 3% to 235.33 and is testing support at the intermediate-term support line for the second time since April.Elsewhere in the chip sector, thinly traded Power Integrations (POWI) bucked the widespread decline, rising nearly 3% to 74.90 after winning a supply deal from Apple (AAPL). Volume shot more than five times Power's 50-day average of 163,000 shares.Fund sponsorship in Power Integration, a small cap at $2.2 billion, has risen over the long term. At the end of the first quarter, a total 370 mutual and hedge funds owned shares, up from 319 in the year-ago quarter.Apple sank more than 1% to 143.74 in quiet volume. A further drop below the 50- and 10-week moving averages would affirm a pair of sell signals triggered two weeks ago: a sharp drop through these key support lines, and a round-trip of gains after Apple rushed past a 141.12 three-weeks-tight follow-on entry point.RELATED:Fed Chief Yellen Bullish On Banks Ahead Of Stress Test No. 2How To Track The Market's Prime Direction: What Does The Big Picture Say?The Easy Method To Spot The Most Important Stock Market TopsHow Are The Top Stocks Performing?

90,KLAC,"XAfter a big surge in value Friday on implications from Amazon.com's (AMZN) purchase of upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market (WFM), tracking-chip maker Impinj (PI) received a stock-rating downgrade on Monday.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach lowered his rating on Impinj to equal-weight, or hold, from overweight, or buy, but raised his price target to 51 from 40.""We remain bullish on Impinj's leadership position in RFID (radio-frequency identification) and secular growth, but want to be disciplined on valuation,"" Hettenbach said in a note to clients.Impinj stock soared 19.1% to 55.71 on Friday after Amazon announced its planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods. It hit an intraday high of 55.96 on Friday.Impinj added 0.3% to close at 55.85 on the stock market today. Seattle-based Impinj went public last July at 14.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Impinj makes RFID tags, scanners and other systems for tracking inventory and other assets. Key markets for its RFID systems include retail stores, warehouses, hospitals and airports.Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods could lead to a big customer for Impinj, since Amazon is reportedly testing its RFID testing.The next potential catalyst for Impinj is the RAIN industry alliance meetings on July 18-20 in Seattle, Hettenbach said. The event is co-sponsored by Impinj and Amazon.Elsewhere in the chip sector, Deutsche Bank resumed coverage of wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) with a hold rating. It set a price target of 62 on Qualcomm.Qualcomm was up 1.4%, near 57.61, at the close.Meanwhile, Stifel reiterated its hold rating on chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but upped its price target to 102 from 92.KLA-Tencor stock was up 3.4% to close at 101.02 Monday.RELATED:Amazon-Whole Foods Deal Sends This Chip IPO SoaringTwo Chip Stocks On IBD 50 List Initiated With Buy Ratings

91,KLAC,"U.S. equities shaved off some of Monday morning's steep losses, yet the broad decline remained largely intact with one hour left in the trading session.Higher volume on both exchanges vs. the same time on Friday indicated some intense profit-taking by large money managers. Oil and gas, wood products, fiber optic tech, and internet content firms led the market's downside.Given the sell-off, IBD investors need to pay close attention to the degree of pullback by their stocks that have broken out of well-formed bases or rallied off a key support level, including the 10-week moving average. And a few in techland appear to be doing just fine.They include megacap consumer tech play Apple (AAPL), sinking just 0.6% to 121.23, still above a cup-with-handle breakout at 118.12; Applied Materials (AMAT), an emerging play for actuator chips, down 2.1%; and fellow chip-equipment firm KLA-Tencor (KLAC), off only 0.3% to 85.88 and holding above an 83.33 flat-base entry.Actuators convert digital signals into physical motion, light or sound and pose as the next step in the Internet of Things megatrend. Applied Materials, down nearly 2% to 34.31, is still more than 10% past a recent flat-base breakout at 31.17; and its RS line continues to rise.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is one several blue-chip stocks that have broken out in recent weeks. Apple is one of six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continues to hint that it's not ready to succumb to a big sell-off, even after rallying more than 260% from a March 2016 breakout past an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16 and flashing climax-run-like action at the end of December. Shares in the leading graphics processors firm edged 1.6% lower following a sharp rebound over the prior nine trading sessions.Watch to see if Nvidia has the strength to form a new cup-type base, which must be a minimum six weeks in length.The Nasdaq composite, falling as much as 1.4% early, was off nearly 1% as of 3 p.m. New York time. The Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.9%.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%; both key indexes also were rebounding from midmorning lows, while the Russell 2000 suffered the worst slide, down around 1.2%. The small-cap gauge, as well as the S&P SmallCap 600, are now both down for the year after leading the major indexes with stout rallies in 2016.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker is set to report December quarter-ending fiscal Q1 results after the close on Tuesday. One big question: Will the Silicon Valley titan finally snap its three-quarter string of shrinking earnings per share?Overall, though, the action in Apple has been steady since the stock climbed out of its long bottoming base pattern with a Sept. 14 breakout past 110.33. Back then, it formed a nice cup with handle that lasted roughly five months. The decline from head to toe in that cup was a little more than 20%. But in the latest cup-with-handle pattern, which began with a stalling day-like session on Oct. 11, Apple corrected merely 12% from high to low within the base.What does that mean? It may indicate that institutions have become more comfortable with holding their shares or even adding to positions.Both today and in the next few days, keep a close eye on those stocks that bounce hard off this week's intraday lows, as well as those highly rated companies that actually make the positive side of IBD's long-running ""Stocks On The Move"" table, part of IBD's proprietary list of screens to help you find the greatest stock market winners.Often, the biggest growth plays will show up repeatedly on Stocks On The Move as they bottom out after a sharp correction, shape the right side of symmetrical-looking base patterns, and break out amid a confirmed uptrend.No doubt, a few stock in energy, telecom and manufacturing sectors are performing poorly after attempting breakouts. They included international oil and gas explorer Hess (HES) (rising just 3% past a 63.86 pivot point); July 2016 IPO Impinj (PI) (breakout past 37.80 flawed cup with handle lasts just five days, now in new basing formation); and Verizon (VZ) (fails to complete a new base after the June 2016 breakout past 54.59 sees limited daylight).The point: Not all breakouts succeed. So one must always have the psychological strength to cut losses short, at a maximum of 7% to 8% but preferably less, at 4% to 5% from the purchase price.Meanwhile, fear is up sharply in the stock market today, at least among options traders; keep an eye on CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, which tracks the volatility premiums on S&P 100 index options. As noted multiple times in the IBD daily Big Picture premium feature, the VIX had reached levels where it would not be a surprise to see stocks taking at least a short break.RELATED:Dow Loses 20,000 As VIX Fear Gauge Spikes From Excessive LowsHow To Trade Stocks: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters TodayHow To Trade Stocks II: How Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009How To Trade Stocks III: Which IBD 50 Firms May Have The Rosiest Sales Growth In 2017?The Best Stock Brokers: Trading Wisdom From the Former Chairman Of E.F.

97,KLAC,"X Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) received a flood of price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts on Friday after it posted fiscal second-quarter results that were better than expected and guided higher for the current quarter. Meanwhile, industry peer Analog Devices (ADI) got a stock-rating downgrade.Broadcom got at least 12 price-target increases from investment banks following its fiscal second-quarter report late Thursday.Among the firms raising their targets on the stock were Barclays, Canaccord Genuity, Cowen, Craig Hallum, Jefferies, JPMorgan, Mizuho, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, RBC Capital Markets, Rosenblatt Securities and Susquehanna Financial Group.The most bullish of the bunch were JPMorgan and Susquehanna, which each upped their targets to 300. JPMorgan was previously at 260, while Susquehanna was at 275.Broadcom ended the trading day at an all-time closing high, up 8.5% to 254.53 on the stock market today, just off its intraday high of 255.82.

101,KLAC,"ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple (AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure to this sector.This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far this year suggests that ETF investors are ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by 27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names include Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven, Internet of Things era — as well as chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Microsemi (MSCC), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Outliers included Alphabet (GOOGL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6% expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism about improving industry fundamentals.While earnings season has put technology companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows and consumption increases, tech companies will be the beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches — 3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies, including more small- and microcap stocks than most other broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366 stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike but offer very different exposures, which affects their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy, given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on the stock market on Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel

It was a different story at JetBlue (JBLU), though, as shares reversed lower, falling 3%. JetBlue forecast an 8%-9% drop in January unit revenue but said the peak February period is looking positive and April appears ""encouraging.""ServiceNow (NOW) jumped nearly 4% to 89.49 in response to solid earnings late Wednesday.

118,KLAC,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley on Thursday selected nine ""high conviction"" stocks that have near-term catalysts that could move their shares higher.Of the nine, four are technology stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). And a fifth, Align Technology (ALGN), is a medical-products (teeth alignment) company.Two of the companies are currently featured on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks: Activision and Align. And one, Amazon, is on IBD's Leaderboard list.The others are wireless tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), commercial bank SVB Financial Group (SIVB), and energy services firms Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Parsley Energy (PE).IBD'S TAKE: Investors.com offers a host of proprietary stock lists to give investors actionable ideas about companies worth considering. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. Leaderboard provides a select group of stock picks showing the most potential for big gains.""Our analysts believe that one or more imminent events will drive the share price (of the nine stocks) materially over the next 15-60 days,"" a group of Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research report.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak expects video game publisher Activision to beat Wall Street's estimates when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company is benefiting from a shift to higher-margin game downloads, vs. packaged media sales, and online and mobile-game traction, he said.Potential catalysts include a faster-than-anticipated shift to full-game downloads and indications that Activision is monetizing its King Digital user base through advertising.""Currently 15% to 20% of games are downloaded digitally, and we expect this to increase to 40%-plus in the next five years,"" Nowak said.Align Technology, which makes teeth-straightening systems, is set to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 7.Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw is looking for San Jose, Calif.-based Align to report strong results. Catalysts for the stock include inflections in discretionary spending, the rollout of Align's G6 feature set, and collaboration with more digital scanner partners.E-commerce leader Amazon is likely to report its Q3 results in late October. Nowak is expecting Amazon to beat Wall Street's consensus expectations.""Our estimates are driven by higher gross profit per customer, which more than offsets our expectations for higher forward streaming-content (spending) and increased fulfillment deleverage from Amazon's large expected warehouse build this year,"" Nowak said. ""We also see potential for further upside due to ongoing strength in Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business.""Amazon is moving into a phase of improving profitability in its core e-commerce business, even as it takes market share, he said.Potential catalysts include Amazon's Q3 results, acceleration of e-commerce penetration in core markets, Prime membership growth, and enterprise cloud adoption hitting an inflection point, Nowak said.Tech services giant IBM could see a lift as it makes progress transitioning from mainframe and other legacy businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said. IBM is becoming more exposed to its emerging businesses in Watson, cloud, analytics, mobile and security, which have double-digit growth profiles, she said.IBM's potential catalysts include an accelerated transformation and recent acquisitions helping to achieve a faster path to revenue growth and improving profit margins, she said.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research is set to report its September quarter results on Oct. 19 and will hold an analyst meeting on Nov. 16.""We would expect both events to be positive for the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore said. Investors are likely to take a fresh look at Lam in the wake of its failed merger with inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor (KLAC).

124,KLAC,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) likely ""cranked up its resistance"" to Lam Research's (LRCX) pending $11 billion KLA-Tencor (KLAC) acquisition, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said Monday.Lam stock, though, continues to trade at record highs, touching an all-time best Monday.Rivals Applied Materials (AMAT) and Tokyo Electron have weaker voices with the U.S. Department of Justice given that they are the competition, Arcuri said. Clients like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are less likely to oppose the acquisition.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials stock rocketed earlier this month on fiscal Q3 sales and fiscal Q4 guidance that easily topped Wall Street's expectations.Samsung has pushed Lam and KLA to collaborate on 3D flash-memory yield challenges, and TSM seems fairly ambivalent, Arcuri wrote in a research report.""Thus, we are left with Intel, (a customer) whose management generally doesn't like when suppliers merge,"" he wrote. Intel ""may have cranked up its resistance and gained traction on the matter with regulators.""Lam's attempt to buy KLA has been stalled since May, when U.S. regulators sent a request for more information about the merger. Analysts have suggested the DOJ is concerned with antitrust matters. KLA's products rate tools created by Lam and its rivals.""A merger theoretically could help Samsung more than Intel given Samsung's 3D Nand (flash memory) leadership,"" he wrote in his research note. ""Also, Lam is ramping -- albeit very strongly -- with Intel, but has historically tended to have a very strong relationship with Samsung.""But the DOJ hasn't blocked a ""conglomerate"" transaction in more than 40 years. Doing so in this case would arguably set a precedent, Arcuri wrote. The idea of regulators blocking the deal on regulatory grounds is a 50/50 proposition at best, he said.Arcuri upgraded KLA stock to an outperform rating, with an 80 price target. He kept his 95 price target on Lam stock, but added that ""Lam is, without a question, a better stock with KLA.""Since the merger was announced on Oct. 21 of last year, Lam stock has lifted 33% and KLA stock 6%. KLA was near a sell zone Monday, down 6% from a 73.69 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20.Lam stock, on the other hand, is now far extended from an 83.93 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20.

125,KLAC,"No. 2 chip-gear-maker Applied Materials (AMAT) reported record earnings late Thursday and fiscal Q3 sales near Wall Street's expectations, as the company's guidance handily beat views, prompting shares to rocket in after-hours trading.Applied Materials stock was up 4.5% in after-hours trading, after the chip-gear maker released its earnings report and after closing up 1.4%, at 27.68, during the regular session in the stock market today, closing just below a 14-year high touched Monday. Shares are up 48% this year, amid IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group's 15.5% rise.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Applied Materials reported $2.82 billion in sales and 50 cents earnings per share minus items, up 13% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped analysts' model for 48 cents. Sales neared the $2.84 billion forecast.Three months ago, Applied Materials' implied guidance was for $2.79 billion to $2.89 billion in sales and 46-50 cents EPS ex items.New orders jumped 26% to $3.66 billion. Its backlog of $4.95 billion rose 60% vs. the year-earlier period.Current-quarter guidance for sales to rise 15%-19% sequentially implies $3.24 billion to $3.36 billion, which would be up 39% vs. last year at the midpoint. Applied Materials' guidance crushed the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.8 billion.Applied Materials also models 61-69 cents EPS ex items, up 124% and topping analysts' views for 48 cents.Applied Materials trails only ASML (ASML) in terms of market cap in IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group.At one time, Lam Research's (LRCX) pending merger with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) appeared poised to overtake Applied Materials. Now, Applied Materials' $29.7 million value would still swallow a combined Lam-KLA by more than $4 million. ASML leads the group with a whopping $44.9 billion value.IBD'S TAKE: Lam's attempt to buy KLA is currently stalled on regulatory concerns with analysts saying earlier this month that Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron could put up an antitrust fight, pummeling the $10.6 billion merger.

126,KLAC,"Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron will likely mount a regulatory attack on Lam Research's (LRCX) $10.6 billion bid to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but that's only if U.S. regulators don't kill the deal that would unite two of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, analysts said Thursday.KLA stock fell 2.8% to 67.51 in the the stock market today after toppling 10% on Wednesday when Lam said that regulatory hurdles in South Korea, China and/or Japan might extend the merger's close beyond the Oct. 20 deadline.Lam stock fell 4.5% Wednesday, and closed down 0.25% to 88.89. Shares are 6% extended from an 83.93 entry point achieved June 2. KLA stock, on the other hand, is down more than 8%, in a sell zone, from a 73.69 buy point hit June 20.The Lam-KLA merger has been riddled with antitrust concerns since its announcement last October. This is the third time the deal has been delayed, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research report Thursday.Shah downgraded Lam stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 85 from 95.IBD'S TAKE: Lam stock has a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs in the top 10% of all stocks. KLA stock trails with a CR of 84.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA, likely over antitrust issues.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $25 billion market cap, trailing leaders ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) with $46.9 billion and $29 billion, respectively. The duo would have 21% market share and be No. 1 or No. 2 in three out of four major manufacturing process steps.""This announcement reinforces a growing trend of skepticism from the DOJ that merger remedies will be sufficient to prevent higher prices,"" Shah wrote. ""Recent examples include Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), Sysco Foods (SYY)-US Foods (USFD) and Albertsons-Safeway.""Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire noted KLA could ask Lam for more money or terminate the deal. Unlike Applied Materials abandoning its bid on Tokyo Electron in the face of antitrust concerns, Lam can't easily walk away from KLA.And foreign regulators are just as apt as U.S. regulators to question the antitrust angle, Maire wrote in a research note.""We are sure that Samsung is pushing Korean regulators for two pounds of flesh,"" he wrote.

127,KLAC,"Japan's Renesas Electronics could encroach on No. 1 automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a $3 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Intersil (ISIL), the Nikkei Asian Review reported early Monday.Intersil stock rocketed 19.8% to 18.74, hitting an eight-year high in the stock market today. NXP stock dipped 0.3%. At Friday's close, Intersil stock already was 7% extended from a 14.65 entry point out of consolidation achieved July 26.Renesas is expected to spend 300 billion yen ($3 billion) to acquire Intersil in an all-cash bid that values the U.S. chipmaker at a 42% premium to Friday's closing stock price. Intersil makes power chips for automobiles, industrial machinery and smartphones.But Renesas could face regulatory hurdles. Semiconductor consolidation went rampant in 2015 on the shrinking industry, but chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) have struggled to merge, due to antitrust concerns. Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), meanwhile, turned down a Chinese bid earlier this year.Overall, the global semiconductor industry is expected to fall 2.3% to $324 billion in sales this year, industry tracker IDC said in May. One reason is that smartphone sales are slowing, slugging Apple (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics alike.IBD'S TAKE: Sales to Apple are key for chipmakers like Intel, which is sidling up to the Cupertino, Calif., smartphone giant via a partnership with ARM Holdings, announced last week during the Intel Developer Forum.As smartphones decline, chipmakers are making deeper grabs for the automotive market. Last year, NXP acquired Freescale Semiconductor, becoming the top automotive chipmaker. Some 40% of its total sales stem from that unit.But NXP is facing competition from rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), which are shoring up their offerings to pull business from tech giants like Tesla Motors (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Autonomous driving, while still nascent, will continue to drive the industry.Intersil, too, is making automotive strides. On the company's Q2 conference call July 28, CEO Necip Sayiner told analysts that automotive sales brought in 13% of total revenue. For 2016, he models north of 20% year-over-year growth in that segment.At 13% of total revenue, Intersil pulled in north of $17 million in automotive sales for Q2. Renesas reported 73.6 billion yen ($733 million) in fiscal Q1 automotive sales. Together, that $750 million between Renesas and Intersil still trails the $858 million NXP reported for its Q2 automotive segment.""We are expecting yet another record quarter in Q3 in our automotive business,"" Intersil's Sayiner said on the call. ""I think it's a little too early to call out Q4, but we don't see anything on the horizon that will shake the strength in that business.""An Intersil spokesperson declined to comment on ""rumors and speculation,"" and a Renesas spokesperson also said the company does not comment on speculation.RELATED:

128,KLAC,"Applied Materials' (AMAT) OLED opportunity is nearly three times that of traditional LCD, CEO Gary Dickerson said Thursday as the No. 2 chip-gear-maker prepares to milk Silicon Valley's push for autonomous cars and virtual reality.Meanwhile, the smartphone and TV opportunities are burgeoning, he said. Apple (AAPL) and Samsung are reportedly considering swapping their liquid crystal display (LCD) smartphone screens for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.OLED screens are lighter, thinner and more flexible. Applied Materials unveiled two systems last year for high-volume production of OLED displays. Chipmakers like Intel (INTC)and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) use Applied Materials' equipment.""We're still in the early innings (in) this smartphone transition to OLED,"" Dickerson told analysts on the company's earnings conference call. ""The display is a key differentiator for mobile devices.""Early Friday, Applied Materials stock bolted to a nearly 16-year high on Wall Street, at 29.74, following its late-Thursday fiscal Q3 earnings release. Shares closed up 7% at 29.64 on the stock market today. Applied Materials stock is up nearly 50% this year.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Applied Materials reported $3.66 billion in new orders, up 26% and topping Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad's outlook for $2.78 billion. The chip business, Applied Materials' bread and butter, accounted for 61% of revenue but grew only 10%.The chip business, though, will benefit from Silicon Valley's push toward autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Applied Materials CFO Bob Halliday said on the call. Tech giants like Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel are digging their heels in on those spaces.IBD'S TAKE: No. 1 chipmaker Intel is making a swift move into the virtual reality space with a ""merged reality"" headset that could rival Facebook's Oculus Rift, Google's Daydream and the HTC Vive by removing the cords and controllers.By far, display orders outperformed every segment. Display orders, which include OLED, jumped 153% vs. the year-earlier period to $803 million, though they only accounted for 22% of the total. Display sales rose 69%, to $313 million.On a sequential basis, Applied Materials guided to 19%-23% growth for its fiscal Q4 chip business, 3%-6% services growth and a whopping 30%-40% growth in displays. The company said total sales are expected to rise 15%-19%, implying $3.24 billion-$3.36 billion.At least six analysts boosted their price targets Friday on Applied Materials stock, and three of those analysts see Applied Materials gaining share vs. key rivals like ASML (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). Lam and KLA are in the process of merging.Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg expects Applied Materials to grow 18% in calendar year 2016 vs. a mere 5% growth for the broader semiconductor fab equipment industry. Twigg has an overweight rating on Applied Materials stock and has upped his price target to 33 from 28.""Applied continues to benefit from new TAM (total addressable market) growth and share gains related to process complexity in NAND (flash memory), foundry/logic and display,"" he wrote in a research report.RELATED:

129,KLAC,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""

130,KLAC,"A pair of semiconductor-equipment makers climbed above buy points Monday, pacing the list of stocks hitting new highs. Lam Research (LRCX) rose 1.39, or nearly 2%, to 84.28, climbing back above an 83.93 buy point of a shallow cup-shaped base. Volume was weak, however, indicating that deep-pocketed institutional investors weren't participating in the move much. Lam recently announced plans to…

131,KLAC,"Feverish chip-sector M&A spiked late Wednesday as ASML (ASML) announced its plan to acquire Taiwan's Hermes Microvision for $3.1 billion, and Cavium (CAVM) unveiled a $1.3 billion bid on networking firm QLogic (QLGC) -- upsetting investors on nearly all sides.Cavium stock toppled 17.5% to a 20-month low on the stock market today. ASML stock closed up 1.5%, and shares of ASML rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) -- which are struggling to complete their merger -- gained 0.3% and fell 0.2%, respectively.QLogic stock surged 9.3% on its acquisition, set to close in Q3.ASML's massive bid on Hermes Microvision is a technology play, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote Thursday in a research report. ASML is angling to combine process control with wafer processing steps at leading-edge process nodes, he says.Not long ago, KLA-Tencor dropped its EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) mask inspection program, which ASML needed to make its EUV tool viable, Robert Maire of Semiconductors Advisers wrote in a research note. Lam benefits from multi-patterning at EUV's expense, so ASML had no choice but to go on an M&A hunt.ASML could have outbid Lam for KLA, but instead it did ""the next best thing and bought the competitor that had beat KLA in the market,"" he wrote. Now, ASML is unlikely to work with Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA, and it will instead ""try to choke off"" competitive products from Applied Materials and KLA.Like the Lam-KLA merger, ASML's acquisition of Hermes Microvision could face U.S. Department of Justice antitrust concerns, Maire said. Mok, on the other hand, says ASML's bid could benefit Lam's deal.""It counters anti-competitive concerns as KLA's competitors come together,"" he wrote. ""Also, it highlights the increased need to combine process control with other types of equipment at the leading edge, supporting Lam's rationale in acquiring KLA.""The ASML deal could spark further consolidation in the chip-gear market, Mok said. He sees Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI) and Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) as potential takeover candidates.

132,KLAC,"Ride-hailing app Lyft tapped the Silicon Valley matchmaker that wheeled Microsoft's (MSFT) $26.2 billion LinkedIn (LNKD) acquisition to help it raise funds or find a buyer, anonymous sources told the Wall Street Journal.Qatalyst Partners founder and Executive Chairman Frank Quattrone, a well known Silicon Valley deal maker,  has contacted companies, including carmakers, about acquiring a large stake in Lyft, the sources said. That stake could be a total takeover.Qatalyst has nearly $190.5 billion in deals listed on its website since 2008, including $41.6 billion in pending deals. Notably, it helped broker the $10.6 billion acquisition of KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by Lam Research (LRCX) and Microsemi's (MSCC) $2.5 billion PMC-Sierra buy against rival bidder Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Lyft, which declined comment to IBD, is Uber Technologies' largest U.S. rival but pales in size, according to Fortune's list of unicorns. Lyft was last valued at $5.5 billion vs. Uber's $62 billion valuation (likely near $68 billion now) and Didi Chuxing's $16 billion value.Apple (AAPL)-backed Didi is giving Uber a greater run for its money in China, where Didi's ride-hailing app dominates in more than 400 cities to Uber's 60 cities. Didi's recent fundraising added $7 billion and includes infusions from Apple, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY).Lyft's Qatalyst hire could mean it's seeking a sale or doubling down on its fundraising efforts against Uber. Recently, No. 1 carmaker General Motors (GM) invested $500 million for a 10% stake in Lyft -- a sixth of Lyft's total estimated value.Toyota Motor (TM) bet an undisclosed amount on Uber, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) is said to be in talks with Uber to make autonomous vehicles. Fiat is also developing a self-driving minivan with Google (GOOGL) and has said it would partner with Apple.Tesla Motors (TSLA), too, is grinding away on the self-driving car route and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are champing at the bit with autonomous driving platforms.Other investments in this field include a $300 million investment by Volkswagen (VLKAY) in Israeli ride-hailing app Gett, and Google's expansion of its Waze app to test out a carpooling service in San Francisco.

134,KLAC,"Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) could be forced to trim competitive segments to push through the $10.6 billion merger that threatens to swallow rival Applied Materials (AMAT), Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire said Monday.And unlike Applied Materials' failed attempt to acquire Tokyo Electron, Lam only sees $250 million in initial savings and therefore has less wiggle room to negotiate potential antitrust remedies, Maire wrote in a research report.""Both Lam and KLA are already superbly run companies without a lot of cleaning up to be done,"" he wrote. ""This suggests that there is not a lot to be gained in efficiency by the combo as they are already quite profitable as separate entities.""The synergies, however, have likely prompted antitrust concerns. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request,"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA. Now, the duo could be forced to sign a ""plea bargain,"" Maire said.KLA products measure competitors' dep and etch tools, leading to a ""fox guarding the hen house"" paradigm where a Lam-owned subsidiary would be charged with rating rivals' tools. Under the DOJ consent decree, KLA could be forced to divest those businesses or license its technology.""The range (of potential remedies) is quite broad, from almost zero cost to deal-killing cost and everything in between,"" Maire said.Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron eventually called off their merger in the face of stringent regulatory concerns.After the DOJ rules, the Lam-KLA deal still faces potential fights from regulators in Japan, China, Korea and the Netherlands, where a number of rivals operate. And major chip manufacturers Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) also will likely have objections, Maire says.""We would imagine that they are concerned about their suppliers gaining too much leverage against them and holding too much consolidated power,"" he wrote. ""Both are probably happier with the status quo.""On the stock market today, Lam and KLA stocks each rose a fraction, trailing a 1% rise in Applied Materials stock. No. 1 chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) stock also rose a fraction Monday.

135,KLAC,"No. 2 chip-gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) toasted Wall Street's current-quarter guidance expectations late Thursday and reported in-line Q2 metrics, prompting shares to rise in after-hours trading.Late Thursday, Applied Materials stock was up more than 4% in after-hours trading Thursday, after the company posted its Q2 earnings results. Shares closed down a penny in the regular session in the stock market today, at 19.91. Top rival ASML (ASML) stock fell 1.3% Thursday.Soon-to-merger KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) stocks split the difference, down and up less than 1% each in the regular session. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group fell nearly 1%.For the quarter ended May 1, Applied Materials reported $2.45 billion in sales and 34 cents earnings per share ex items, flat and up 17%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales edged analyst views for $2.43 billion and EPS beat the consensus for 32 cents.Three months ago, Applied Materials guided to a 5%-10% sequential increase in sales, implying $2.37 billion to $2.48 billion, and 30-34 cents.Applied Materials guided to a 14%-18% quarter-over-quarter jump in current-quarter sales, implying $2.79 billion to $2.89 billion and topping the consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.51 billion. Sales would be up 14% vs. the year-ago quarter.EPS minus items guidance for 46-50 cents was a dime above Wall Street at the low point, and would be up 45.5%.

136,KLAC,"Applied Materials (AMAT) could surf the ""rising tide"" of 3D Nand, but rival Lam Research (LRCX) will likely outgrow the No. 2 chip-gear-maker, a Needham analyst said Wednesday ahead of Applied Materials' Q2 earnings report, due after the close Thursday.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Applied Materials stock was up 2%, near 20, leading soon-to-merge rivals Lam and KLA-Tencor (KLAC), whose shares were up 1.8% and 1%, respectively. The three trail ASML (ASML) in terms of market value. ASML stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon.For its fiscal Q2 ended in late April, Applied Materials is expected to report $2.43 billion in sales and 32 cents earnings per share minus items, flat and up 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. That would come off 4% declines for both metrics in Q1.Three months ago, Applied Materials guided to a 5%-10% sequential jump in sales ($2.37 billion to $2.48 billion) and 30-34 cents EPS ex items.Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok reiterated his buy rating and 22 price target on Applied Materials stock. Mok and Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad both expect Applied Materials to report an in-line Q2.But Mok sees potential upside to Applied Materials' Q3 guidance on strength in 3D Nand flash memory demand. Lam recently guided to 9% quarter-over-quarter shipment growth for Q2. Mok expects Applied Materials to ""grow similarly, although likely at a slower pace than Lam.""He sees Applied Materials guiding to 2%-7% sequential growth for Q3 vs. consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which models 3% quarter-over-quarter sales growth.Ahmad, on the other hand, expects in-line Q3 guidance. For the second half of the year, display revenue could be guided up 10%-20% vs. last year's flat quarter, but DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) guidance could disappoint.""DRAM second-half revenues could be ticked down to flat (vs. the prior period),"" he wrote in a research report. ""Expectations are relatively high. Most investors expect a beat than a miss,"" but DRAM has been macroeconomically slogged for several years on slowing PC sales.He kept his outperform rating and 23 price target.

137,KLAC,"Stout competition to take a chunk of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy business drove Applied Materials' (AMAT) Q2 display orders to grow nearly sixfold, and Applied Materials CFO Robert Halliday doesn't see that slowing this year.On a year-over-year basis, display orders soared a whopping 483% to $700 million, accounting for 20% of Applied Materials' record-busting $3.45 billion in Q2 orders. For the year, mobile will push more than 70% of those display orders, Halliday predicts.""The great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate,"" he said late Thursday on Applied Material's fiscal Q2 earnings conference call with analysts. ""It's not a one-quarter event, and we see the concentration in mobile.""In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Applied Materials stock rocketed more than 13%, near 22.50, touching a 14-month high. Chip-gear rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) stocks jumped 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. ASML (ASML), the No. 1 maker of chip manufacturing gear by market cap, was up 2%.Applied Materials' equipment enables chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Intel (INTC) to produce chips. Last year, Applied Materials unveiled two systems that enable high-volume production of OLED displays.OLEDs, organic light-emitting diodes, are used to create thin, flexible displays and lighting panels for TVs and mobile. Apple is reportedly switching to OLED iPhone displays and might have tapped Samsung to make them, according to AppleInsider.com.The OLED opportunity is huge, Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said on the call.""New display technology, such as OLED, are enabled by materials innovation,"" he said. ""This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied.""At least four investment banks boosted their price targets Friday on Applied Materials stock, with Needham and Credit Suisse analysts noting Applied Materials' huge opportunity in China, where the company has a 30-year-plus relationship.During Q2 ended May 1, Applied Materials reported $1.97 billion in silicon orders, up 15% year over year. Nand (flash memory) accounted for 49% of those orders, as companies like Micron (MU) and Intel ramp their 3D Nand technology.""The almost $1 billion in Nand bookings confirmed Applied Materials' strong positions around 3D Nand with multiple products,"" Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a research report, as he boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 26 from 22.

138,KLAC,"Chinese, Japanese and South Korean regulators could gum up Lam Research's (LRCX) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by following in the footsteps of the U.S. Department of Justice, which is asking for more information on the proposed merger, an analyst said Monday.Late Friday, the companies said the DOJ had sent a ""second request,"" digging deeper into Lam Research's $10.6 billion plan to acquire KLA-Tencor. Only 2%-4% of merger proposals get a second request, Semiconductor Advisors president Robert Maire says. Of those, he says about a third go through as planned but the other two-thirds either get challenged by the DOJ or get a consent decree, which is approval with conditions.In the Lam-KLA deal, the likely concerns revolve around antitrust. Together, the companies would be close to matching the market cap of Applied Materials (AMAT), which is No. 2 among makers of chip manufacturing equipment, behind ASML (ASML).Also, together they could pressure etch pricing for major players like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the latter an Apple (AAPL) supplier. Tokyo Electron and Hitachi (HTHIY), which compete against Lam in etch, might oppose having KLA continuing to inspect their tools and processes.""While not good news, a second request is certainly not a death sentence for the merger, but at the very least (it) means more time and money and scrutiny to get approval,"" Maire wrote in a research note. The 30-day clock for DOJ approval has now been reset.In midday trading on the stock market today, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor stocks were down nearly 2% and 1.4%, respectively, both near three-month lows. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Equipment industry group was down a small fraction midday Monday.Maire says the DOJ could ""ask for the kitchen sink of information.""""The (second request) is not just a simple test of overlapping product lines,"" he wrote. ""It looks at things like market concentration and anti-competitive issues. (Lam-KLA) would certainly have a large concentration of the overall market.""The chip industry is most concerned about KLA's standing as an ""impartial arbiter"" of others' tools, he says.""Will Lam dep and etch tools get an unfair advantage? An early look at results? A more complete look?"" Maire asked. ""(It's) kind of a lot like insider trading.""Lam and KLA already have the go-ahead from Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan, but they still needs a slew of other foreign approvals. This DOJ action can ""snowball into a problem"" if it becomes too costly, Maire says. Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron called off their merger in the face of strong regulator scrutiny.The request further delays the merger's close, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok noted in a research report, saying he expects the deal to close in Q4, as opposed to the companies' target for Q3. Western Digital (WDC) closed its $19 billion SanDisk acquisition last week, a merger that was announced within hours of the Lam-KLA match-up.Neither Mok nor Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri worry about the Lam-KLA deal getting approval, however. In his report, Arcuri called the second request ""more procedural in nature.""""There is no overlap here, and certain big customers have been pushing these companies together for several years, especially around the issue of yield ramp in 3D,"" he wrote. ""We continue to see the deal closing in (the) August time frame.""Arcuri cut his price target on Lam stock to 85 from 93. Lam and rival ASML recently indicated minor timing delays for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory)-related shipments, he wrote. Lam has guided shipments up for the second half of the year, but Arcuri isn't that confident.""Weakness for Lam seems focused on the memory side, with some signs of a less aggressive 3D Nand (flash) shipment cadence to Toshiba, seemingly due more to capital constraints at this customer rather than any fundamental change in the 3D Nand ramp itself,"" he wrote.But Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron (MU) and Intel Dalian haven't experienced any mirrored slowdown, he wrote.

140,KLAC,"Chipmakers, chip designers and chip equipment makers have been showing strength in the current stock market.As of Friday’s IBD, the semiconductor manufacturing group was No. 27 among 197 industry groups. Three weeks ago the group also was No. 27 and six weeks ago No. 28. So chipmaker stocks are keeping their grip.The fabless chip designer group is No. 29. Three and six weeks ago, the group’s rank was No. 26 and No. 44 respectively. These rankings also show stamina.The semiconductor equipment group is No. 16 and rated 14th and 23rd three and six weeks ago -- again solidly positioned.What’s the deal with chip stocks?Chips aren’t getting a great deal of attention right now because they have had a hard act to follow.In 2014, global sales jumped 9.9% vs. 2013, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. At $335.8 billion, it was the highest sales ever.However, 2015 sales eased 0.2%. And in Q4, sales were 5.2% below the year-earlier pace.In a press release Feb. 1, Semiconductor Industry Association President and CEO John Neuffer said, “Factors that limited more robust sales in 2015 include softening demand, the strength of the dollar, and normal market trends and cyclicality. In spite of these challenges, modest market growth is projected for 2016.”Data for January is expected to be released in early March.One factor that could help the chip sector long term is legislation that Congress passed recently. The legislation permanently extends the research and development tax credit.Neuffer called the legislation “a huge win” for the chip sector.The permanent aspect is regarded as important because it allows the industry to plan ahead.Which stocks in the three chip groups are worth attention now?Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) is the leader in chipmaker group. The small-cap stock has a Composite Rating of 98, the highest rating in the group. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 98 puts the stock in the top 2 percentile.Earnings in fiscal 2016, ending in September, are expected to leap 52%.Columbia Acorn A Fund (LACAX) opened a new position in Q4.Chartwise, the stock is working on a pattern that looks like a double-bottom on the daily chart.Small cap play MaxLinear (MXL) has the best ratings in the chip designer group. The Composite Rating is 99.Earnings are expected to grow 26% this year.MaxLinear’s chart also looks like a double-bottom base on the daily chart. It is just under a 16.29 entry.Big cap KLA Tencor (KLAC) has the best rating in the chip equipment maker group among the stocks with good liquidity. Its Composite Rating is 98.Earnings are expected to grow 28% in fiscal 2016 ending in June.KLA is working on a shallow double bottom within a larger consolidation.

141,KLAC,"Applied Materials (AMAT) filled a Lam Research (LRCX)-size hole in Q1 market share, but likely didn't snag a chunk of KLA-Tencor's (KLAC) customer base, Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire said Friday.The ""zero sum game"" pits Applied Materials against a Lam-KLA combination. Analysts theorize that once Lam and KLA merge -- expected later this year -- the duo could surpass Applied Materials as the No. 2 chip gear maker.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $21.5 billion market value to Applied Materials' $21.4 billion, as of Friday. ASML Holdings (ASML) leads with a $37.8 billion. Shares of all four rose Friday on Applied Materials' Q1 beat and Q2 guidance surprise late Thursday.Applied Materials stock gapped up as much as 10% In early trading on the stock market today, and was up 9%, near 19, in afternoon trading Friday. Shares of Lam and KLA were up 3.5% and 2%, respectively. ASML stock was up more than 2.5%.Collectively, IBD's 36-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment was up nearly 3% Friday afternoon.Maire sees the stock rebound as temporary. Applied Materials' Q1 was ""well short of others in the industry."" Its $2.28 billion in orders and $2.26 billion in sales for the quarter ended Jan. 31 were down 6% and 5%, respectively, from the prior quarter, the analyst notes.Silicon system orders of $1.27 billion and display orders of $183 million fell 12% and 6%, respectively, from the prior quarter. But service orders of $773 million rose 1.5% sequentially and set an all-time quarterly record.Current-quarter guidance for $2.37 billion to $2.49 billion in sales,  and 30-34 cents earnings per share ex items, easily topped analyst consensus. Maire expects chipmaking tool orders to rise 25% this quarter, but suggests that 30%-40% sequential growth would be stronger.Lam's March-quarter guidance was weak, however.""Applied Materials looks to have orders up substantially in the current quarter,"" he wrote. The guidance ""begs the question of whether there was some shift from Lam to Applied Materials in the current quarter.""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg says the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending fell 4% in 2015 vs. Applied Materials' 2% year-over-year growth in silicon systems.He models 3% silicon sales growth over 2016 vs. a 2% year-over-year increase in industry-wide WFE sales. Applied Materials, however, says equipment demand will be flat in 2016 vs. 2015.Twigg maintained his overweight rating and 20 price target on Applied Materials stock.Calendar 2016 will split between Nand (flash memory) and DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), Applied Materials said. Nand will dominate the first half of 2016, while DRAM, logic and foundry sales will pack the tail end.Service sales continue to ""rock and roll"" and will likely offset a trough in the tool business cycle, Maire wrote.But Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad sees Applied Materials' bounding on its OLED (organic light-emitting diode) investments. OLED displays don't have a backlight and thus are thinner than traditional LCDs (liquid crystal displays).Ahmad bumped his price target on Applied Materials stock to 23 from 22.50 and reiterated an outperform rating.OLED displays are being adopted into TVs, computer monitors, smartphones and hand-held game systems. Ahmad sees Applied Materials' investment in OLED technology as driving 10% year-over-year growth in 2016 display sales.Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson told analysts during the earnings conference call that the company is ""growing beyond the semiconductor.""""It is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED,"" he said. ""This plays to our strengths and significantly expands the market.""OLED expands Applied Materials' total addressable market by a factor of three vs. LCD, Dickerson said.Combined, OLED and LCD technologies put the display business on track to reach $1 billion in fiscal 2018 revenue, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a report. Mok upgraded Applied Materials stock to buy from hold and reiterated a 22 price target.

143,KLAC,"A key tenet of IBD’s investing strategy is to focus on leading stocks in leading industry groups.When stocks move, they tend to move in groups. If a high-quality Internet name reports strong earnings, it tends to lift other Internet stocks. IBD research has shown that close to half of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of its industry group.Top-rated stocks with solid fundamentals can be found throughout the pages of IBD. It’s also not hard to keep tabs on leading industry groups in the market.It’s been a defensive market for a while. Perhaps nowhere is that fact more reflected than in IBD’s industry group rankings. Every day, IBD ranks 197 industry groups based on six-month price performance. IBD's ""What’s The Market Trend?"" page (today on B4) shows the top 40 groups and worst 40 groups. The top 10 performing groups from the prior session appear in blue, and the 10 worst performers are in red.The page shows each group’s current ranking as well as its ranking three weeks ago and six weeks ago. Use this area to see which groups are working their way higher through the rankings.The market is in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through day for the Nasdaq on Feb. 17, but the overall tone remains defensive, as gold miners, tobacco, utility and food stocks continue to perform well.IBD’s Industry Themes column, found daily in the B section of eIBD and the newspaper, spotlights strong performing groups in the market with potential for further upside. Each day, IBD market writers scan the database, looking for groups acting well with broad leadership. A group has potential if its leadership is broad. Groups with just one bona fide leader should generally be avoided.While it’s still an overall defensive market, some non-defensive groups are holding their own. Earlier this week, IBD's Industry Themes column featured chip stocks. As of Friday’s close, all three chip-related groups ranked within the top 25.Among chip designers, fast-growing Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) recently cleared a base with a 48.24 early buy point. In the chipmaker group, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) has cleared a 23.76 cup-with-handle entry. In the chip-equipment group, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is approaching a 70.38 buy point from a long cup-with-handle base.The strength of an industry group can also be assessed with IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Enter a stock's ticker symbol, and the site will show its industry group's top five companies based on their Composite Rating.

144,KLAC,"Semiconductor equipment makers have jumped up IBD's industry rankings in recent weeks amid acquisitions.The 36-stock group has risen 43 places in the past six weeks to No. 10 out of 197 as of Monday. A quarter of the group's members have Composite Ratings above 90, indicating that they're outperforming 90% of all stocks in five IBD metrics, such as sales and earnings growth.Milpitas, Calif.-based KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Brookfield, Conn.-based Photronics (PLAB) lead the industry with Composite ratings of 97, just below the best-possible 99.Photronics, which makes photomasks used in semiconductor, microelectronics and flat-panel display manufacturing, has seen a revival in profit growth after a string of declines.  Earnings in the latest quarter jumped 257% to 25 cents a share, the third straight quarter of triple-digit increases. Revenue rose 14% to $142 million.The stock is getting support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with a buy point at 13.05. Its relative strength line is hitting new highs, which is bullish, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares. However, it has a daily average turnover of less than $20 million, making it somewhat thinly traded.The company has benefited from new products and the proliferation of mobile devices. However, Photronics is expected to lose some business after its  joint venture with Micron Technologies (MU) expires in May, according to a recent New America column.Nevertheless, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, in a Dec. 21 research note, said it expects Photronics to have more than $200 million in excess cash when the Micron tie-up ends, giving the company ""unprecedented flexibility to pursue strategic alternatives,"" such as a small acquisition or expansion into China.Meanwhile, KLA-Tencor has reported three straight quarters of accelerating profit growth after a series of declines. On Thursday,  the company said profit for the fiscal second quarter that ended in December jumped 53% to $1.04 a share, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. Revenue rose 5% to $710 million.In October, Lam Research (LRCX), another industry leader, said it would buy KLA-Tencor for more than $10 billion. The combined company will have a 42% share of the wafer fabrication equipment market. The acquisition is expected to close by midyear.
"
145,KLAC,"The high cost of developing new products is driving acquisitions in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  Also, research firm Gartner said Jan. 11 that worldwide semiconductor capital spending will likely drop 4.7% this year due to sluggish demand for electronics products amid weak global economic growth, putting added pressure on the industry.Mattson Technology (MTSN), another leader in the semiconductor equipment group, said in December that it had agreed to sell itself to Beijing E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center amid China's efforts to develop a semiconductor industry. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.

146,KLAC,"Stocks shifted into staggered losses as trade bucked higher on Friday, with earnings results and oil prices stirring a fair share of early action.The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% apiece. The Nasdaq narrowed its early decline to trade a fraction lower, aided by a rally among chip equipment stocks.Volume rose sharply as options expirations drove early trade up 53% on the NYSE and 16% higher on the Nasdaq.Today's weak start was the stock market's first dip out of the starting gates in this holiday-shortened week. For the week, indexes still hold solid gains, with the Dow trading up 2%, the Nasdaq ahead by 2.8%, and the S&P 500 showing a 2.1% gain. The options expiration trade clouded the view a bit into behavior among institutional investors, as bulls are generally on the lookout for quiet action while leading stocks build bases.Oil prices contributed to the market's early weakness with West Texas Intermediate slipping more than 3%, back below $30 per barrel to traded effectively flat for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) releases its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow index stocks traded lower, with Boeing (BA) and Chevron (CVX) at the bottom of the list, nearing 2% declines. Advancers held to gains of less than 0.2%.Chip equipment makers headed the S&P 500 as Applied Materials (AMAT) rose more than 9% after a narrow fiscal Q1 sales and earnings beat, followed by better-than-expected guidance. Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) were next in line with gains of 5% and 3%, respectively.Yahoo (YHOO) also figured into the mix, jumping 3% after announcing it had formed a committee of independent directors and enlisted services of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and PJT Partners to explore strategic options. The company has been vexed over whether and how to spin off its stake in China's Alibaba Holdings (BABA), valued at nearly $40 billion.Among IBD 50 stocks, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) popped more than 2% after its Q4 earnings met, and revenue easily topped consensus forecasts. The stock has been fighting to hold above its 10-week moving average as well as a 41.09 buy point since a mid-January breakout.Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) retreated 3%, slipping to the bottom of the list.

149,KLAC,"Nomura Securities stuck its neck out on Wednesday and revealed its top stock picks for 2016 in technology, media and telecom. Analysts for the investment bank picked five stocks as ""top picks for 2016"": Alphabet (GOOGL), Arista Networks (ANET), Lam Research (LRCX), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Microsoft (MSFT). It rates all five stocks as buy.Alphabet and LinkedIn are IBD Leaderboard stocks, while the others are also highly ranked by IBD with Composite Ratings of at least 89 out of a possible 99.Google parent Alphabet will see mobile search, YouTube and advertising technology as revenue drivers next year, Nomura said. Operating expense discipline and share buybacks should boost earnings per share, analysts said. Nomura raised its price target on Alphabet to 900 from 875. Alphabet stock fell 1.6% to 762.55 on the stock market today.Arista's 50% exposure to cloud computing providers leaves it best positioned to benefit from public cloud adoption, Nomura said. It has a price target on Arista of 95. On Wednesday, Arista dropped 1.9% to 71.84.Chip gear maker Lam Research will see its ""transformative merger"" with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) boost its valuation and earnings next year, Nomura predicted. Nomura has a price target on Lam of 100. Lam stock dropped 2.6% to 78.32 on Wednesday.LinkedIn's strong product roadmap, including a new mobile app, refreshed Recruiter product, mobile ads, and Lynda.com should drive greater than 25% revenue growth over the next three years, Nomura said. Nomura has a price target on LinkedIn of 290. LinkedIn stock fell 3% to 231.34 on Wednesday.Microsoft should benefit from its transition to cloud computing — such as Office 365, moderating the declines in its Windows operating system business — and from operating expense control, Nomura said. The investment bank raised its price target on Microsoft stock to 65 from 60. Microsoft shares dipped 1.5% to 54.98 on Wednesday.

150,KLAC,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone ""elephant in the room"" clouded Qorvo's (QRVO) otherwise upbeat analyst day, an MKM analyst wrote late Tuesday as he suggested that the chipmaker might be considering a hefty M&A play.Qorvo stock closed up 5.6% in the stock market today at 54.74.March-quarter expectations for a 10%-15% depression in iPhone sales remained unchanged, MKM analyst Ian Ing noted in a research report. Ing retired his 71 price target and buy rating on Qorvo stock.""With the iPhone 'elephant in the room,' we felt investor concerns regarding a smartphone unit slowdown remained only partially addressed and not in Qorvo's control,"" Ing wrote.Slower growth rates are still likely out of China, he added.But Qorvo's overall outlook was positive, Ing wrote. The company revised its long-term target model to 32%-35% vs. an earlier 30% target and outlined plans to recapture Samsung and MediaTek smartphone share in China.A recent $1 billion debt issuance could signal that Qorvo's Industrial and Defense Products segment is becoming acquisitive, Ing wrote. Strategic M&A could help Qorvo's IDP business grow at twice the industry's 7% growth rate.Qorvo would merely be the latest in a series of recently acquisitive chip companies. Last month, Lam Research (LRCX) agreed to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), a combination that might overtake Applied Materials' (AMAT) market share, and Western Digital (WDC) made a bid for SanDisk (SNDK).Earlier this year, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR), and Avago Technologies (AVGO) announced its plan to acquire Broadcom (BRCM).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

310,KLAC,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) could grapple for Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), which is rumored to be on the sales block amid heavy chip industry M&A action.Maxim stock was up 7% Wednesday afternoon on a report that Texas Instruments was looking to acquire the company. Reports last week had Analog Devices doing the same. Texas Instruments stock was down nearly 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Texas Instruments is in talks to acquire Maxim. Maxim, which has an $11 billion market value, might not sell unless the company's receives a high premium, sources told Bloomberg.An $11 billion offer would actually be on the low end in terms of big chip industry deals this year. Broadcom (BRCM) is being acquired by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago (AVGO) for a whopping $37 billion.That deal, announced in May, was the biggest pure-tech merger — until this month's announced $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC).In June, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for $16.7 billion.This month, Lam Research (LRCX) announced it plans to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) for $10.6 billion. That same day Western Digital (WDC) said it agreed to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.Also this month, Microsemi (MSCC) leaped over the bid by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in a battle to acquire PMC-Sierra (PMCS), making a $2.4 billion offer.Chip M&A action has ramped amid an industry downturn with slowing growth, increasing costs and competition, and macroeconomic concerns, particularly in China, analysts say.Maxim makes sense for Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, analysts say, and both figure in on the M&A speculation.Texas Instruments CEO Kevin March, however, seemed doubtful of joining the M&A move, in comments during the company's recent Q2 earnings conference call with analysts.""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing suggested in a research report that Texas Instruments might want to change its M&A tune.""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter and on Facebook.

311,KLAC,"Inphi (IPHI) stock gapped up Wednesday on Wall Street after the chipmaker reported Q3 earnings that, for the eighth consecutive quarter, more than doubled year over year.And at least one analyst now sees Inphi as a potential M&A target.For its fiscal Q3 ended Sept. 30, Inphi reported 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 108% year over year, and above the consensus which modeled 24 cents. Three months ago, Inphi guided to between 22 cents and 26 cents.Although Inphi has more than doubled its EPS in each of the last eight quarters, Q3 was the fourth in a row showing deceleration.Revenue of $62.4 million, up 72%, also beat the consensus of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which saw $61.3 million. Inphi previously guided to $59 million to $63.6 million.In the current quarter, Inphi expects 25 cents to 27 cents EPS on $63.3 million to $65.3 million in sales. Sales would be up 17% at the midpoint while earnings would fall 13% at the midpoint vs. the year-earlier quarter.At least five analysts boosted their price targets on Inphi stock on Wednesday.Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan rates Inphi stock a buy and issued a price target of 31. He was ""cautiously optimistic"" on Inphi's return to business in China.Inphi CEO Ford Tamer said Tuesday that the chipmaker saw depressed Q2 mobile sales out of China reverse in Q3.""We have seen a resumption of the China demand,"" Tamer told analysts during the Q3 earnings conference call. ""We feel confident that Phase II of the China mobile infrastructure has resumed. So, based on the data we have today, we're seeing obviously orders flowing back in.""Sundararajan sees ""significant chances that Inphi could become a target of acquisition."" M&A action within the chip industry hit a fever pitch this year with the multibillion-dollar acquisition deals selling SanDisk (SNDK) to Western Digital (WDC), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) to Lam Research (LRCX), Altera (ALTR) to Intel (INTC) and Broadcom (BCRM) to Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO).Inphi stock carries a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 in its Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group, putting it alongside other top-performing stocks like Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), ARM Holdings (ARMH), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Cavium (CAVM).Cavium stock, set to report its fiscal Q3 after the close Wednesday, was up nearly 1.5% in early trading. Integrated Device Technology stock, which beat forecasts in its Q2 report and announced an acquisition Tuesday, was up more than 3%.In morning trading on the stock market today, Inphi stock was up nearly 8%, trading near 30.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

""It is not about quarter-over-quarter changes in inventory and reported gross margins.""Q1 revenue at Intel's data center group, which reflects sales of server chips, rose 19% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $3.7 billion. Internet of Things Group revenue rose 11% to $533 million.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, Nomura, Pacific Crest Securities and Topeka Capital Markets boosted their price targets on Intel stock Wednesday, but Cowen & Co. lowered its price target.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, the No. 1 chipmaker and long the dominant supplier of processor chips for PCs, reported Q1 earnings per share excluding items of 41 cents, up 8%. Revenue was flat at $12.8 billion, in line with Intel's lowered revenue forecast. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of 41 cents on $12.9 billion in revenue.The chipmaker's Q2 revenue forecast also fell below views.

""While mobile losses remain heavy, we believe Intel's modem/system-on-chip technology is gradually closing the gap in a quickly thinning herd of competitors.""Krzanich also said ""challenging macroeconomic conditions and an appreciating U.S. dollar weighed on our business"" in Q1 and that its newly formed Client Computing Group results ""reflected weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC supply-chain inventories.""Krzanich declined to speculate on ""rumors"" when asked by analysts about acquisition plans, referring to recent news reports that Intel has been in talks to buy programmable chipmaker Altera (ALTR). Altera stock was up 2.5% in afternoon trading Wednesday, near 43.Improving Profit MarginsPacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell in a research report Wednesday boosted Intel's price target to 37 from 35 and maintained an overweight rating, saying Intel's strong data center group results ""buoys its gross margin.""Intel's closely watched gross profit margin was 60.5% in Q1, down from 65.4% in Q4 but up from 59.6% in the year-earlier quarter.

Yet, shares of chip equipment makers Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC)and Lam Research (LRCX) were all up at least 1% in afternoon trading Wednesday.Summit Research Partners analyst Srini Sundararajan said in a research note Wednesday that while it may seem ""counterintuitive,"" Intel's lower capital expenditures could actually work in the semiconductor equipment company's favor because ""most spending is likely on higher margin, higher revenue-per-unit"" products.Intel for the first time in Q1 combined results from its money-losing Mobile and Communications Group with its profitable PC Client Group by forming the new Client Computer Group, which now includes sales from PC microprocessors and chips for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Client Computer Group sales fell 8% to $7.4 billion.Intel forecast full-year revenue as flat with last year's $55.87 billion, which is a touch higher than the current consensus for $55.65 billion. Gross profit is expected to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of percentage points.Cowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri on Wednesday lowered his price target on Intel to 33 from 37 but reiterated a market perform rating.""Intel's full-year guidance was not unexpected, but also requires 2015 to be the most second-half loaded year since the 2009 recovery — a factor which raises some eyebrows given ongoing questions around PC demand and mix shift to low-end given the U.S. dollar's strength,"" Arcuri said.RELATED:SanDisk Q1 Likely To Be In Line With Preannouncement.

467,KLAC,"No. 1 chip gear maker Applied Materials, saying it's negotiating the biggest changes in the history of its industry, late Thursday posted a 56% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations.Revenue rose 14.7% and slightly missed Wall Street expectations, but Applied (AMAT) stock was up nearly 2% in after-hours trading, after it released results for its fiscal Q3 ended July 27.The company's Q4 earnings outlook slightly beat views, while its revenue outlook was just light, as the company continues the process of acquiring one of its top rivals, Tokyo Electron, pending regulator approval.Despite the industry ""being in the middle of the biggest changes in its history enabled by materials innovation,"" Applied's operating profit margin has improved for seven quarters in a row, company CEO Gary Dickerson said in a conference call with analysts.""More than any other supplier, Applied Materials is a 'transistor performance' company, and thus in a sweet spot to capture more of the spending mix as customers adopt new transistor architectures in an effort to ward off a slowdown in Moore's Law,"" said Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research report Thursday.Moore's Law refers to Intel (INTC) Gordon Moore's famous observation that the number of ""components per integrated function"" on a silicon chip — that is, computing power — will double roughly every 18 months.For Q3, Applied reported earnings per share minus items of 28 cents, up from 18 cents in the year-earlier quarter and a penny above the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue of $2.27 billion fell just shy of the $2.3 billion analyst consensus.Applied said Q3 orders rose 24% to $2.48 billion.Projects Double-Digit EPS RiseThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company expects EPS ex items in the current quarter of 25 cents to 29 cents, up 32% to 53%, on revenue of $2.19 billion to $2.33 billion, up 10% to 17%. Analysts has been modeling 26 cents and $2.28 billion.Applied Materials' growth continues as it awaits its merger with Tokyo Electron, which still needs the blessing of U.S. regulators and China's Ministry of Commerce.The merged company will take the name Eteris, which company executives say is derived from the concept of ""eternal innovation for society.""The merger would create a company with a market value estimated at $29 billion in September 2013, when Applied and Tokyo Electron announced their marriage. Applied executives said Thursday that they still expect the deal to close this year.Like other chip equipment makers, Applied Materials experiences cyclical earnings results as its customers — makers of chips, displays and solar panels — react to demand by building up or cutting back their production capacity.But Applied Materials and its peers could benefit from a positive outlook, as worldwide semiconductor capital equipment spending is projected to total $37.5 billion in 2014, up 12.2% from 2013, market tracker Gartner says.Global semiconductor capital equipment spending fell 11.6% to $33.4 billion in 2013. Gartner also forecasts a 12.8% increase in 2015, to $42.3 billion, before seeing a 5.9% decline in 2016, to $39.8 billion.The capital spending forecast estimates total capital spending from all forms of semiconductor manufacturers, including foundries, back-end assembly and test services companies.Applied Materials said orders for its Silicon Systems Group — or sales of equipment to chipmakers — fell 6% last quarter to $1.57 billion, led by declines in purchases of tools for foundry chipmakers and DRAM memory chip manufacturing.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mahesh Sanganeria wrote in a research report that Applied Materials' rivals such as KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also are likely feeling the impact from a delay in foundry spending.Milpitas, Calif.-based KLA-Tencor in late July reported EPS minus items for it fiscal Q4 ended June 30 of 80 cents, down 2% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected 86 cents. Revenue rose 2% to $734 million, just above the consensus of $733.7 million.

479,KLAC,"If you are looking to invest in potential stocks from the semiconductor space, you can’t ignore NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).For the past two years, NVIDIA has been impressing investors with its stellar performance, wherein the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.Moreover, in the year so far, the stock has rallied 26.9% as against growth of 1.4%, 8.1% and 8.3% recorded by the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), respectively.The share price rally highlights that the slew of bad news related to the company, such as sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners and Uber’s driverless-vehicle test incident, which prompted NVIDIA to suspend test drives for all its driverless vehicles, did not have any negative impact on investors.We also believe Uber’s driverless-test mishap will lead to increased investment by vehicle makers to make driverless cars safer. Hence, demand for NVIDIA’s chips will remain unaffected, in our opinion. Moreover, this March, the company unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.Furthermore, although NVIDIA predicts a slowdown in crypto-specific GPUs revenues in the near term, we believe this will be immaterial to its financials. The company foresees demand for its GPUs to shift from miners to gamers, going forward, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset loss of revenues from miners.NVIDIA, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the preceding four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.1%. The company witnessed sharp upward estimate revision over the past 7 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 5.4% (9 cents) to $1.77 per share, during the same time frame, and reflects year-over-year growth of more than 75%.Of course, NVIDIA is our first choice in the semiconductor industry, however that does not mean the list ends here as several companies in the space are likely to benefit from the rising demand for chips.Solid Industry Growth ProjectionThe semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017. It is believed the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, marking 7.7% growth.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers’ earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from President Trump’s business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns.4 Semi Stocks for Rest of 2018Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) takes the second position in our list after NVIDIA. Micron has turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry, in the year so far. The company’s shares have appreciated nearly 31.3% during the period, a much better performance than the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.This outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron’s robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the past four quarters.We believe the company will continue its splendid growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which has been escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products, the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a massive 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 3% (8 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.Our next pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, coming up with an average positive surprise of 9.1%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 8.9% (41 cents) to $5.00 per share, in the last 30 days. The stock has ascended 9.8% in the year-to-date period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The next stock in our list is KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report). KLA-Tencor is likely to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. Furthermore, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth for the company’s process control and yield-management solutions.KLA-Tencor’s shares have gained 6%, in the year so far. The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7.5%. Moreover, the EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 9.2% (18 cents) to $2.14 per share, over the past 30 days.The next stock on our radar is Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report). The company’s continued focus on adding new products in the industrial and auto space is estimated to effectively address the increasing demand for semiconductor content in these markets. Additionally, Texas Instruments’ solid presence in other end markets, stable revenue stream and rising demand for its products will broaden the company’s clientele and addressed market.Results of this Zacks Ranked #1 company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and came in line in the other, over the preceding four quarters. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 7.5%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 5.7% (7 cents) to $1.30 per share, over the past 30 days. The stock has ascended 4.6% in the year-to-date period.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

482,KLAC,"The following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank’s full May Market Strategy report. To access the full PDF, click here.One highlight in the May 2018 Zacks Market strategy report is the sudden dominance of Industrial spending.The Industrial Products sector is currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors. It is one of the sectors expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by U.S. tax reform. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth rate of +25.8% in the first-quarter of 2018, on the back of a +12.8% rise in revenues.Earlier this year, an Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation report focused on the $1T equipment leasing and finance industry. It highlighted the breaking trends.Investment in equipment and software is projected to expand +9.1% in 2018.That 2018 investment growth projection is well above the +5.2% growth rate experienced in 2017.It continued a strong improvement trajectory seen over the last 12 months.While a few headwinds persist, they should be outweighed by an encouraging business investment climate.In addition, an upbeat outlook for industrial companies — such as defense contractors, building products and machine makers — is a bet on continuing global economic revival.Stronger growth around the globe means companies spend more on new machinery, see increased cargo demand on railroads, and profit from an increased pace of automation.Internally, U.S. corporations must spend more to replace aging equipment and tech systems. The age of equipment in the U.S. remains at all-time highs and desperately needs to be replaced. This so-called “upgrade” cycle is creating a boom for industrial companies.What about the money to finance the spending? It comes from the new lower 21% corporate profit tax – that stronger U.S. and global economy – and an internal change in U.S. tax rules. This change will allow companies to take a deduction for the full value of new plant and equipment upon purchase, rather than stringing it out over a number of years.Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card on the condition of the nation's infrastructure. In 2013, the country received a sad D+. The 2017 report card was no better – another D+.Clearly, the need for a U.S. infrastructure overhaul had been there. But what exactly did that mean, who pays for it, and how much should be spent?That Society of Civil Engineers Report Card had put up many questions and few answers.It appears, until now.Zacks May Sector/Industry/Company TelescopeMay Zacks Industry Ranks showed a very important change.

486,KLAC,"Shares of Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) slumped nearly 5.5% in morning trading Thursday after UBS initiated coverage of the trendy stock with a sell rating. The analyst team, led by Timothy Arcuri, are apparently bearish on Micron due to “cyclical memory concerns and big estimate cuts.”Arcuri argued that Micron’s supply chain has struggled to keep inventory growth on pace with revenue expansion over the four quarters, a phenomenon which has helped create a “very favorable cyclical backdrop” for the semiconductor business. However, the analyst feels this factor is rapidly waning and will soon become a headwind.UBS also assigned a sell rating to chip behemoth Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, the firm initiated coverage of three semiconductor plays—Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Marvel Technology (MRVL  -  Free Report), and KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report)—with buy ratings.Arcuri’s concern that cyclical trends could eventually become headwinds is one that frequently looms above the semiconductor industry. Decades of progress in personal, business, and mobile computing have allowed analysts and investors to pick up on recurring factors that both drive growth and cause pullbacks.However, those that are bullish on Micron believe that new secular trends are enough to outweigh these cyclical factors, and company management is working to shift the rhetoric by painting a new picture of its business.“The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,” said Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in the company’s latest earnings report. “More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.”Memory remains a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical trends like those mentioned by Arcuri. But for those that believe in the power of these new secular trends, this means that Micron is trading at extremely attractive valuation levels.For instance, MU is currently sporting a Forward P/E of just 5.2, which comes in at a significant discount to the average of 18.8 displayed by our broader “Computer and Technology” sector. Micron is also sporting an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.It is also worth noting that, despite Arcuri’s bearish sentiment, analysts have been largely optimistic about Micron over the past month. In fact, the company has witnessed nine positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates within the last 30 days, lifting its Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.48. This positive revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want more market analysis from this author?

When saw an historic rally on Monday, a gut-wrenching sell-off on Tuesday, and then a slow, low volume, grinding rally today to close out the week.You could definitely be forgiven if you didn’t feel like thinking about it and just enjoyed the long weekend. But just in case you need something to consider during the long weekend, here are some week-ending picks.Fasion ValueMichael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) stock is on a roll but is still valued very attractively to its peers thanks to accelerating earnings and a penchant for beating estimates time and time again.With product lines for a wide range of customers (aptly named “luxury” and “accessible luxury”) and the recent acquisition of Jimmy Choo shoes, KORS is one of a handful of retailers who are actually adding new brick and mortar store rather than closing them.With a forward P/E of 13.7, as compared the to the Apparel industry average of 19.6, KORS is a growth stock that priced like a value stock. Recent analyst revisions upward for earnings earn KORS a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Food ValueTyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) is easily the best managed food company in the U.S. It’s environmentally responsible, fair and generous to employees and (let’s not forget) extremely profitable. Tyson is growing earnings considerably faster than the competition yet trades at a forward P/E of just 11.

KLA Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) provides technical solutions and proprietary software to hardware manufacturers. KLAC recently agreed to acquire Israeli-based circuit board producer Orbotech and over the next 12-18 months, will return $2 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of a share buyback. Consensus estimates for continued strong earnings are the reason KLAC is a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy.)

488,KLAC,"With the oldest members being 37 years old and the youngest just 18, millennials believe that they have a long way to go before they reach retirement. But time flies faster than one thinks and when their retirement age arrives, these millennials may not have sufficient savings.Some experts believe that given their current lack of savings, the majority of this generation won’t be able to retire even in their 70s. This has also been supported by a recent study from National Institute on Retirement Security, which states that two-thirds of the working millennials have saved nothing for their retirement.Some experts believe that the generation’s interest on holidaying rather than saving is the main reason for their failure to save. Others believe that millennials are overburdened with their monthly payments like education loan and credit card bills. Apart from these, one-fifth of the generation supports aging parents by paying for their medical bills and other expenses.All these circumstances have made it tougher for the generation to set aside money for their sunset years.Likely Challenges for MillennialsThe generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the continuous advancements in medical science and healthier lifestyles — which means they will need more funds. Escalating healthcare costs also pose a challenge.Although U.S. citizens will have social security but it is difficult to say whether it will be adequate to maintain their lifestyle. Their woes will mount if the U.S. government closes this facility after 25-30 years. It already costs the federal government more than $1 trillion, which will increase exponentially as the majority of the citizens will fall under the senior category by that time.It’s Never Too Late to Start SavingWhatever small amount you save today, if invested wisely, it can give you a healthy return in the long run. There are plenty of investment options available but given the young age of millennials and their risk taking capabilities, we suggest investing in equities as these offer maximum returns. The improving domestic as well as global economic scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the market. Additionally, with Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies, the manufacturing sector is poised to witness huge investment in the next few years, thereby generating employment and increasing wage rate opportunities. All this is likely to further strengthen the U.S. economy, which will tend to reflect in the stock market.Considering an annual return of 8%, a monthly investment of just $100 in equities by a 25-year old till his 65th birthday will save him or her approximately $341,120.However, investing in equities has its own share of risks. Not every stock will have a remarkable run. Also, the risk of a market crash remains.Therefore, investing in stocks that generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks is prudent. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Blue Chip Dividend Stocks are the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are less affected by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Choosing the StocksIt is difficult to pick the right stocks from a wide range of available investment opportunities.This is where the Zacks Stock Screener comes in handy. With the help of this screener, we have filtered in Buy-rated stocks that have a market value of $10 billion or more, a decent dividend paying history along with an annualized yield of over 2%.6 PicksThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the world’s largest aerospace company.

493,KLAC,"As we head into the heart of Q3 earnings season, investors will want to maximize their profit potential by targeting companies that are likely to beat earnings estimates. While share price movements are no guarantee, stocks that surpass estimates are more likely to move higher in the days following their reports, and that post-earnings momentum can continue for several weeks.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With that said, here are a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now:1.       Potlach Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report)Potlach is an integrated forest products company with substantial timber resources. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing three quarters, and the stock is now up nearly 26% year-to-date. Currently, PCH has an Earnings ESP of 1.43%. Potlach will report its third-quarter results after the market closes on October 24, and investors will be interested in seeing if this stock—which just hit a new 52-week high—can surge even higher. 2.       Viper Energy Partners (VNOM  -  Free Report)Viper Energy is engaged in owning, acquiring, and exploiting oil and natural gas properties primarily in North America. Viper has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 11 straight quarters, and shares have surged more than 20% so far in 2014. As of right now, VNOM has an Earnings ESP of 3.37%. The company is scheduled to release its third-quarter results after the closing bell on October 24. Shares are near their 52-week high, but the stock might be able to break higher if it can impress investors again. 3.       Greenbrier Companies (GBX  -  Free Report)Greenbrier is a leading supplier of transportation equipment and services to the railroad and related industries. In the past two quarters, the company has smashed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 25%. It’s also worth noting that Greenbrier belongs to our “Transportation - Equipment and Leasing” group, which currently sits in the top 9% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Heading into its report on October 27, Greenbrier is sporting an Earnings ESP of 2.35%. This is another stock near its 52-week high, but shares could find a new range on the back of another solid report. 4.       Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique solutions that are tailored to the Internet of Things. On the back of strong global demand for such solutions, VSH has moved nearly 29% higher this year.

494,KLAC,"On a day when all the major averages all closed more than 2.5% higher – the biggest one day percentage gains in two and a half years – one industry stands out as an even bigger winner, the semiconductor equipment manufacturers.  Already posting strong gains for the year even after last week’s steep sell off, two industry leaders outpaced the broader markets - Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) with each gaining approximately 6%.  Strong MomentumThe semiconductor equipment manufacturers enjoyed a record year in 2017, with $55.9B in sales, up sharply over the previous year’s $41.2B.  Sales are expected to increase even further in 2018 to $60.1B, a 7.5% increase and the second consecutive record high, according to SEMI, the global trade association for the Semiconductor supply chain industry. The stocks in the sector have been rewarded handsomely, with the top players more than doubling in price since 2016.  These impressive price increases were well justified however by similar increases in revenue and net earnings at these well-run companies, so they remain attractively valued as compared to market indices. LRCX also recently announced a $2B stock buyback.Attractive ValuationsAMAT trades at a forward P/E ratio of 12.57 with LRCX at 12.09, versus approximately 25 for the NASDAQ 100 index.  Both also sport lower P/E’s than industry competitors KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries (AES  -  Free Report) and ASML Holdings (ASML  -  Free Report).  Semiconductor stocks do have a history of trading at  lower prices relative to earnings than the major indices owing largely to their higher price volatility, but both of these names are currently trading below their own historical P/E’s and well below the overall P/E of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX  -  Free Report)  of which they are both components.AMAT and LRCX both have a Zack’s #1 Ranked (Strong Buy), based on a recent history of positive earnings estimate revisions (with AMAT joining the list today.)

495,KLAC,"KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to acquire Israel-based circuit board company Orbotech Ltd. (ORBK  -  Free Report).The deal is valued at approximately $3.4 billion or $69.02 per share through a combination of cash and stock. The acquisition is expected to close before the end of this year. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, Orbotech’s shareholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.In addition, KLA-Tencor announced a share repurchase authorization worth $2 billion. The program is expected to be completed within 12-18 months following the close of this transaction.KLA will fund the acquisition and stock buyback with cash on hand and proceeds from $1 billion sale in new long-term debt. Post acquisition, Orbotech will continue to operate as a standalone business of KLA-Tencor, based in Israel.Coming to the share price, KLA’s shares have returned 24.4% in a year’s time, substantially underperforming the 59% rally of the industry it belongs to. Deal Rationale Orbotech Ltd. is an Israeli firm that develops yield management and process-enabling solutions for electronic products. The company’s systems are used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards, chip devices, flat panel displays, packaging and other semiconductor manufacturing areas.The deal is in sync with the company’s strategy to strengthen its business by expanding into adjacent markets. The merger of these two companies will create an equipment powerhouse with a huge range of products, services and solutions, customer breadth and scale. The deal will allow KLA to diversify its revenue base. The chip maker will now get an access to the fast-growing market for printed circuit boards and flat panel displays, worth $2.5 billion annually.Talking about financial benefits, the deal will be immediately accretive to KLA’s revenues, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. In addition, the companies expect to realize $50 million in cost synergies within two years following the closing of the deal.ConclusionKLA-Tencor offers complete yield-management solutions including hardware, software and services that help improve the output, and reduce overall production costs.Cost reduction is of primary importance today, as increasing competition across all growing end markets leads to demand for lower-cost components. Since yield-management solutions improve manufacturing costs, demand for these products remains strong at any point in the business cycle.We believe, Orbotech’s new products, services and solutions will diversify KLA’s revenue base and drive its long-term growth.KLA’s President and CEO, Rick Wallace, said ""This combination will open new market opportunities for KLA-Tencor, and expands our portfolio serving the semiconductor industry. Our companies fit together exceptionally well in terms of people, processes, and technology.”KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and Consensus  KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and Consensus | KLA-Tencor Corporation Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKLA-Tencor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

497,KLAC,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group: AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

512,KLAC,"The Q4 earnings cycle is in full swing with a number of semiconductor companies slated to report the quarterly numbers over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.It is believed that the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from the rising demand from the aforementioned new trends in technologies, deployment push of 5G-broadband technology across the globe and President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s see what’s in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures tomorrow.The world’s largest semiconductor company Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to post earnings of 86 cents per share and revenues of $16.3 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, represent 8.9% increase for earnings and almost flat growth for revenues. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with this chipmaker’s competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia’s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.However, we anticipate the company’s impressive growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment’s growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel’s data-center business will expand. (Read: Factors That Are Likely to Impact Intel's Q4 Earnings)Let’s take a sneak peek at KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report), which is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. We expect KLA’s top-line growth to benefit from its expanding product portfolio. The company is well poised to gain from sturdy demand for more efficient manufacturing processes. Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to steer growth from the company’s process control and yield management solutions. (Read: KLA-Tencor Q2 Earnings to Gain From Product Strength)KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues and earnings are pegged at $960.2 million and $1.72, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s figures, indicate growth of 9.5% for revenues and 13.2% for earnings. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lastly, Microsemi Corporation  is another company scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues and earnings are pegged at $460.1 million and $1.01, respectively, for the quarter under review. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, indicate growth of 5.6% for revenues and 17.4% for earnings. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.Microsemi Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsemi Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsemi Corporation QuoteThe company’s data-center segment is likely to continue its outperformance in the to-be-reported quarterly results, chiefly driven by the sound adoption of the latest technologies, including AI and HPC. Increasing usage of its smart-controller solutions on Intel’s Parley platform is also anticipated to prove conducive to growth. Also, an improving economy and energy markets, continuing semi-cap strength, as well as demand for emerging industrial automation and motor control applications is likely to drive its Industrial market segment revenues. Nonetheless, pockets of weakness related to product transition at medical customers and push-out of some communications spending in China are likely to dent revenues.Another semiconductor company, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues and earnings are pegged at $619.9 million and 64 cents, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s figures, indicate growth of 12.5% for revenues and 39.1% for earnings. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. QuoteThe company’s fiscal second-quarter revenues will likely gain from sturdy demand for its Automotive and Industrial end-products. However, the concentration of Maxim’s mobility revenues at Samsung is a big concern. Samsung’s projections and announcements, especially those related to its high-end models, where Maxim has greater exposure, might have a significant impact on the company’s performance.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.43%.Notably, on a 12-month basis, KLA’s shares have returned 39.5%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 68.2%.Let’s find out what KLA has to offer investors in this quarter.Expanding Product Portfolio to Drive Top LineWe expect KLA’s top-line growth to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. The company is well poised to gain from strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes.Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth from the company’s process control and yield management solutions.We believe solid customer demand for products across the four end-markets — Wafer Inspection (46% of shipments), Service (21%), Non-semi (3%) and Patterning (30%) — is anticipated to drive order growth in the upcoming quarter.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, KLA expects shipments of $945-$1.025 billion. Foundry orders are expected to be approximately 20% of shipments. Memory shipments are anticipated to be 60%, with NAND representing 55% of the mix. Logic is currently projected to be 14% of the shipment.KLA forecasts revenues between $930 million and $990 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $960.2 million.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Product segment is currently pegged at $759 million.Services Growth & China: Key FactorsServices have become a key-growth driver in recent times. Last quarter, services revenues increased 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to $208.8 million, which was also better than the consensus estimate of $202 million. The growth was driven by expanded installed base and increasing demand for the upgrade and maintenance of legacy nodes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Service is currently pegged at $208 million.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Moreover, our proven model shows that KLA is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and +0.35% Earnings ESP.

514,KLAC,"Recently, KLA-Tencor Corporation’s (KLAC  -  Free Report) rating has been downgraded by Needham’s analyst Y. Edwin Mok to “hold” from “buy”.This downgrade comes on the heels of lower customer spending on foundry products and memory pushouts. Moreover, KLA’s customer concentration poses a serious threat to its shipment growth.Following this announcement, the company’s share price declined 3.4% at market close on Jun 22.Coming to the price performance over the past 12 months, shares of KLA have returned 10.9%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 30.9%.Factors in DetailPer the analyst, the ongoing sluggish trend in customers’ investments on 7 nanometer (NM) and 5 NM foundry products is likely to persist throughout the second half of 2018. This poses a serious threat to the KLA’s shipments.Further, Samsung, one of the most important customers of KLA, has decided to postpone some of its 10 NM DRAM production and related equipment purchases. Notably, Samsung has accounted for more than 10% of KLA’s total revenues for three consecutive years since fiscal 2015.This is likely to impact the demand for KLA’s wafer equipments adversely. Its shipments in the third-quarter of calendar year 2018 will be hurt, which will further hinder the company from meeting its shipment expectations.Further, fall in wafer demand from major customers will hurt the fundamentals and profitability of the company. Consequently, restricted number of customers remains a major issue.Moreover, this decision of Samsung has resulted in share price declines of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).Further, the recent trend of transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND remains negative for wafer demand since the latter requires less wafer and provides higher density.KLA’s Performance & Positive OutlookDespite of the cyclicality in consumer investment pattern and major transitions in the semiconductor industry, KLA managed to perform well in the third-quarter fiscal 2018.KLA reported revenues of $1.02 billion which improved 5% year over year. Product revenues came in $797.8 million, accounting for 78% of revenues. This can primarily be attributed to increased investments from memory and logic customers for next generation technology as well as capacity-related investments.Additionally, shipments were $1.041 billion, which went beyond the guidance of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Memory, foundry and logic contributed 78%, 13% and 9%, respectively.Moreover, we remain optimistic about the company’s positive outlook for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 in which the company expects revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and shipments in the range of $1.01-1.09 billion.Memory shipments are anticipated in the range of 60-70% of the total shipments, foundry is likely to account for 24% while logic is expected to account for 8% o the shipments. Further, in foundry segment, KLA expects orders for the first wave of investment in 5 NM in the second half of 2018.Consequently, the positive business outlook, strong fundamentals and continued momentum in China are likely to aid the stock rebound in the upcoming quarters.KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, KLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

515,KLAC,"KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27 after the bell.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that complicates surprise prediction. This is because per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, KLA-Tencor’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.55%.KLA-Tencor’s shares have returned only 26.96% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 41.92% rally.What Happened in the Second Quarter?The company’s earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues and earnings grew 28.4% and 43.8% year over year, respectively, driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company’s new products.Expectations for the Fiscal Fourth QuarterWe expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and preference for mobile to work in favor of the company. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Given that each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the fourth quarter, KLA expects shipments of $890–$970 million. Quarterly revenues are expected between $885 million and $945 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.46–$1.66.Bottom LineKLA’s comprehensive product line, cost-reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits. Although competition and a concentrated customer base increase execution risk, accelerated process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results. This therefore holds true for the soon-to-be reported quarter.KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks which you may consider instead, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1.

Top-line improvement came on the back of impressive HealthTech portfolio sales.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – jumped 14.6% year over year to €439 million ($482.7 million), benefiting from cost-productivity programs and higher volumes.On the other hand, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at €73 million ($80.3 million) compared with net cash flow of €177 million witnessed in the prior-year quarter.The company’s comparable order intake rose 8% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Personal Health sales rose 6% year over year to €1,761 million ($1,936.4 million). This segment recorded a 6% hike in comparable sales. Double-digit growth in Health & Wellness, high-single-digit growth in Personal Care and mid-single-digit growth in Sleep & Respiratory Care drove this segment’s top line.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter to €1,671 million ($1,837.5 million). Comparable sales grew 3% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy proved conducive to growth.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues were almost flat year over year at €768 million ($844.5 million). On a comparable basis, sales inched up 1%. Sales improvement came mainly on the back of low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.However, sales decline in Healthcare Informatics, Solutions & Services proved to be a drag for the segment.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to be weak and fell 8.6% year over year to €92 million ($101.2 million). Lower royalty income due to foreseen expiration of licenses marred the sales of this segment.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €2,220 million ($2,535.8 million) from €1,926 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €2,599 million ($2,968.8 million) compared with €5,269 million a year ago.During fourth-quarter 2016, the company completed its three-year EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program. Philips will launch a share buyback program for €15 billion in third-quarter 2017, to be executed over a span of two years.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs – namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence – implemented earlier. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, and accelerate growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in 2016, the company achieved €269 million of gross savings in overhead costs, €418 million of gross savings in procurement and €204 million of productivity savings from the End2End program. In second-quarter 2017, cost savings on overhead and procurement led to a remarkable increase in margins, saving about €109 million.The company now aims to enhance its performance further and targets to deliver 4–6% comparable sales growth, and adjusted EBITA margin expansion of around 100 basis points per year.AcquisitionsThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips signed an agreement to acquire Spectranetics to strengthen its Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. Spectranetics is a provider of vascular intervention and lead management solutions. Philips also acquired CardioProlific, a US-based company that develops catheter-based thrombectomy technology for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Both these acquisitions will complement Philips’ portfolio of image-guided therapy devices.Philips also inked an agreement to buy U.S.-based medical device company, Electrical Geodesics, Inc. This acquisition will likely enhance the former’s imaging technologies and advanced informatics portfolio, used in neurological applications.The company penned an agreement to buy Respiratory Technologies, which provides an innovative airway clearance solution for patients with chronic respiratory conditions.Furthermore, subsequent to the quarter, Philips acquired image-analysis software provider TomTec Imaging Systems. TomTec specializes in diagnostic ultrasound that helps healthcare personnel to increase efficiency and diagnostic quality. Along with CardioProlific and Spectranetics, TomTec will likely be conducive to Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio as well.Earlier this month, Philips also acquired the UK-based Health & Parenting, a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents, in order to strengthen its Personal Health businesses.Update on Lighting DealPhilips had successfully offloaded a major stake in its lighting business – Lumileds – as it inked an agreement to sell an 80.1% stake in Lumileds to NY-based private-equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC in early February this year. This fresh deal, which values the whole unit at $2 billion, closed in second-quarter 2017. Also, Philips sold 22.25 million shares of Philips Lighting.As a result of these transactions, its shareholding in Philips Lighting has decreased to 41.2%. Hence, the company is reporting Philips Lighting as part of Discontinued Operations.OutlookPhilips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4–6% and anticipates gaining momentum in the second half of the year, boosted by a strong order book.While the company expects an uncertain climate in the U.S. and continued volatility in its markets, Philips is enjoying robust orders in China and India, as well as Europe.Our TakePhilips’ second-quarter results were quite consistent, with growth in both top- and bottom-line performance. The company’s cost-saving programs have been producing tangible results, thus supplementing its strength. It further believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, even in the face of continued volatility in the markets in which the company operates.Philips is presently focusing on key opportunities in population health management, while improving its enterprise-wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations, to fortify the company’s foothold in the healthcare industry. Its numerous acquisitions should also prove accretive to its top line in the quarters ahead, and help strengthen its foothold in the end markets.Moreover, offloading of the lighting business is a major positive and will likely help this company allocate its resources in core business areas to stoke growth, moving ahead.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPhilips presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

517,KLAC,"On Jul 19, Zacks Investment Research downgraded Seagate Technology plc. (STX  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Earnings estimates for Seagate have been revised downward over the last 30 days for 2017 and 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 remained unchanged at $4.46, while that for 2018 declined to $4.70 from $4.75 over the same time period. The downgrade can primarily be attributed to declining product demand, competitive market structure, sluggish macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends.We believe Seagate’s significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Notably, Seagate’s shares have underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.1%, the stock returned 1.7%.Intensifying Competition & Declining Demand Remain HeadwindsSeagate is experiencing a downturn primarily due to declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data.Shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting the growth of hard disk drives (HDD) manufacturers like Seagate. Moreover, the merger of Western Digital and SanDisk has intensified competition in the storage industry, particularly in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This remains an overhang on the company.The company is diversifying its product portfolio to outweigh the negative impact of diminishing HDD market, thereby lessening the risk of customer concentration. However, the products are at a very nascent stage to contribute positively to its top-line growth.Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate faces pricing pressure because of high volatility in the DRAM and NAND space, which led to the company maintaining low inventories in the current quarter.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), Veeva System (VEEV  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

"
518,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.
"
519,KLAC,"As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.
"
520,KLAC,"The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.2011 Dampened by Natural Disasters
"
521,KLAC,"While 2010 benefited from pent-up demand, 2011 was expected to gain from the growing popularity of mobile devices. However, growth in the first half was tempered by the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, while that in the second was affected by the flooding in Thailand.
"
522,KLAC,"As a result, expectations continued to trend down right through the year. The SIA was originally looking for a growth of around 6% in 2011, which dropped a notch to 5.4% by mid-year. However, in December, growth expectations slipped to 1.3%.
"
523,KLAC,"The SIA stated that the industry grew modestly in the first half (up 3.7%), naming the corporate refresh cycle, smartphone growth, and increased spending on IT infrastructure as the main drivers that were partially offset by cautious consumer spending and the disaster in Japan. Increased use of semiconductors in all end-markets and particularly in the automotive market will drive semiconductor sales, according to the SIA.
"
524,KLAC,"However, the typical second-half pickup was not strong enough, mainly because this generally comes from back-to-school and holiday-driven spending for consumer and mobile computing devices. However, consumers bought less enthusiastically this year than in past years, due to fears of the recession continuing. Second, Europe continued to disappoint. Third, the flooding in Thailand impacted HDD manufacturers, and the ripple effect impacted PC manufacturers and thereby, semiconductor manufacturers.
"
525,KLAC,"iSuppli also cut expectations significantly from 4.6% to 2.9%. Gartner expects 2011 sales growth of just 0.9% compared to its previous expectation of 5.1%. Other research firms, such as VLSI, IDC and IC Insights took down their estimates to 2.3%, 3.4% and 5%, respectively.Computing and Consumer Markets Remain Biggest Drivers
"
526,KLAC,"These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.Computing
"
527,KLAC,"A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Although developed markets continue to show signs of maturing, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures, there are some points of encouragement as well.Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.
"
528,KLAC,"Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and now, ultrabooks), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia is emerging as one of the strongest drivers of growth in this market.
"
529,KLAC,"Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. The cost advantages of moving to the cloud are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.
"
530,KLAC,"The main negative for the computing market is the cannibalization by tablets, which are in the nature of consumer devices with computing functions. This is pulling down spending on core computing (PCs, notebooks and netbooks).Consumer Electronics
"
531,KLAC,"With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.
"
532,KLAC,"The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
533,KLAC,"The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is not very optimistic about consumer electronics sales this year. While it expects the overall growth rate to be around 5%, most categories are expected to slow down. Smartphones, with an expected growth rate of 22%, are expected to save the day. Tablets and e-readers are expected to help again this year with double-digit growth rates.
"
534,KLAC,"While the CEA did not provide details for all products, it did mention that TVs would be relatively flat this year with growth if any expected to come from emerging markets. Approximately 50% of TVs sold in the U.S. will be connected compared to 12% in 2011.
"
535,KLAC,"Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy touched bottom in the second half of 2010, although trends indicate that the recovery is slow and very gradual. Despite the much lower unemployment rate, consumers remained decidedly cautious in both the 2010 and 2011 holiday seasons. An offsetting factor has been the individual buying habits that continue to favor electronic gadgets as holiday gifts. The trend may be expected to continue, which is a positive for semiconductors serving the market.Other Markets
"
536,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending is not likely to exceed 3-4% this year, as carriers cut investments despite growing traffic. While technology upgrades should continue, carrier spending in Europe will be impacted by fears of a recession, while in the U.S., growth could taper off following several years of strong spending. Chinese players are likely to keep the pressure on the pricing side.
"
537,KLAC,"Automotive chipmakers should see good growth over the next few years. While the recession and natural disaster in Japan have severely impacted these players in the last few years, there are signs of growth in both the U.S. and Europe. However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.
"
538,KLAC,"Perhaps the biggest driver of growth for automotive chip manufacturers is the increasing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation. With electronic stability control becoming mandatory in the U.S., there should be sustained demand for enabling devices.
"
539,KLAC,"Additionally, microcontrollers for engine functions and transmission controls are becoming more popular, since they increase the efficiency of automobiles and make them more eco-friendly. Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics, Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments are the major beneficiaries here. Linear Technologies has also increased its exposure to the automotive segment, so it should gain from the growth in the market.
"
540,KLAC,"Medical Devices is an upcoming area and adoption of semiconductors in this market may be expected to accelerate over time.
"
541,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) continues to strengthen, as passenger and cargo traffic continue to increase.
"
542,KLAC,"The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. The focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Near-Term Outlook
"
543,KLAC,"We see continued inventory rebalancing over the next few months, which will negatively impact suppliers to the computing market. Additionally, cannibalization of traditional computing devices should continue through the year. Therefore, this end-market will have a significant negative impact on the industry. Consumer devices, such as TVs will be another area of softness.
"
544,KLAC,"However, other consumer devices, such as tablets and smartphones, will consume a large number of ICs. The automotive market will be a positive force this year.
"
545,KLAC,"Memory manufacturers should do well again this year, although it will continue to be a difficult year for DRAM (currently in oversupply). Logic should do well.Ever Smaller & More Powerful
"
546,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Major Players
"
547,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be broadly categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.Chip-makers
"
548,KLAC,"According to preliminary estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).
"
549,KLAC,"Renesas remained at number 5, followed by Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) remained at number 7, with Hynix, Micron Technologies (MU  -  Free Report) and Broadcom (BRCM) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions. Applied Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Equipment Makers
"
550,KLAC,"Gartner estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers increased 2% in 2010, following a 38% decline in 2009, accounting for 63.4% of total equipment sales. The overall equipment market is estimated to have increased 143% to around $41 billion in 2010. Automated test equipment (ATE) was the strongest segment (up 149%), wafer fab equipment (WFE) was close behind with a growth rate of 145%, while packaging assembly equipment (PAE) was third, having grown 127%.
"
551,KLAC,"The very strong growth may be traced to a particularly weak 2009, when the recession impacted demand for semiconductors and capital spending was minimized. In this environment also, Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) easily maintained its number one position, followed by ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report) and Tokyo Electron Ltd in that order. Lam Research Corp (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) Dainippon, Teradyne, Inc (TER  -  Free Report), ASM International (ASMI) Nikon and Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) were the others in the top 10.
"
552,KLAC,"The 2011 estimates are not available yet. Exposure to the solar market and acquisitions will account for most of the changes in the top 10.Foundries
"
553,KLAC,"The Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years and the top five positions have changed again, according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), GlobalFoundries has now taken the third position in the pureplay segment, pushing the Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI) to the fourth position.
"
554,KLAC,"Also, specialty foundry Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) has jumped to the fifth position. A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment – Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments’ foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.OPPORTUNITIES
"
555,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.
"
556,KLAC,"One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (probably not a 2012 phenomenon).
"
557,KLAC,"Others would be Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that also use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about these companies in 2012.
"
558,KLAC,"We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s growth initiatives in mobile and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans. The company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.
"
559,KLAC,"AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.
"
560,KLAC,"The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.
"
561,KLAC,"Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Analog Devices (ADI) and ON Semiconductor (ONNN). Also, while some companies, such as Linear Technologies (LLTC), Semtech Corp  (SMTC), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) will have mixed performances given their varied dependence on the auto market, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses.
"
562,KLAC,"Linear and Maxim have also reduced their dependence on the computing market, which we see as a positive in the near term. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2012.WEAKNESSES
"
563,KLAC,"We believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although NAND and NOR are slightly better off.
"
564,KLAC,"In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.
"
565,KLAC,"The foundry segment will also have a moderate year (at best). The Thailand flooding and resultant weakness in the PC market and soft consumer spending increases risks in our opinion. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.
"
566,KLAC,"We also remain cautious about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite the relatively strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.
"
567,KLAC,"The stock market’s tech benchmark set a new record for all-time highs in a calendar year. While Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) helped Nasdaq reach a record close, other Silicon Valley tech stocks continue to hover near the mark. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported blowout earnings results, while such an encouraging trend is noticeable for the entire tech sector.Some market pundits believe that tech stocks are riding the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute a part of this uptick to Trump administration’s pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position them for faster growth in the market. Given such bullish trends, investing in some rock-solid Silicon Valley stocks for better gains seems judicious.Nasdaq Scales Record High on Apple’s SuccessThe tech-laden Nasdaq Composite trumped all records on Nov 3. The index registered its 63rd record-closing high of this year that beat the previous record of 62 highs in a calendar year. The index has also outpaced the other major indices so far this year.While the Nasdaq has rallied almost 26% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gained nearly 16% and 19%, respectively, over the same period. In fact, the tech-stacked indexes’ year-to-date gains are the best since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.Stellar quarterly results from tech-bigwig Apple helped the Nasdaq scale a record high. The iPhone maker gained 2.6% and flirted with a valuation at $900 billion. The world’s most valuable company has soared 48.9% so far this year.Apple’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $52 billion topped analysts’ expectations. Almost half of the sales came from iPhone. Chief Executive Tim Cook declared that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales were the best ever in the company’s history. Its service units that comprise iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care, to name a few, also raked in record-high revenues.Profits also rose to $10.71 billion, while the executives showed more optimism over the current quarter. They raised the fiscal first-quarter sales guidance from $84 billion to $87 billion. This has ward off fears related to the company’s flagship iPhone X production, priced at $1000. This is, incidentally, the most exorbitant iPhone model in the company’s history (read more: Apple Stock Pops on Q4 Earnings Beat, Strong Guidance).Blowout Tech EarningsApple isn’t the only Silicon Valley tech stock moving north this season. Better-than-expected quarterly results from other tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) also helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high.Alphabet’s third-quarter earnings of $9.57 increased 91% sequentially and 32% year over year. Net revenues of $22.27 billion increased 6.5% sequentially and 21.9% year over year. While Google Cloud generated substantial revenue growth, it continues to enjoy strength in the mobile platform (read more: Alphabet Beats Earnings, Revenue Estimates in Q3).Microsoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 84 cents per share, up 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $24.54 billion increased almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. The company was also successful in achieving its goal of attaining $20 billion in annualized revenues from its commercial cloud business (read more: Microsoft Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong Azure Growth).Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed more than 30% so far this year. To top it, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), eBay Inc (EBAY  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) continue to hover near record highs as the tech sector displays strength in the third-quarter earnings season.Total earnings for the tech companies’ third-quarter earnings so far are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% surpassing revenue estimates (read more: The Tech Sector’s Impressive Earnings Power on Display).Tax Cuts – A Major Boost to Software & Semiconductor StocksHopes of pro-business legislation promised by Trump have, mostly, supported the gains among both the manufacturers of the internal technologies — the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States is among the worlds’ highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. The proposed tax plan will lower taxes from 35% to 20%. As a result, tech companies’ after-tax earnings will improve and will lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for R&D and M&As.Tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have billions of dollars in cash reserves parked abroad. In fact, a Nikkei Asian Review showed that combined overseas cash reserves for such companies exceeded the Japanese government’s overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.5 Top Silicon Valley Stocks to Buy NowInvestors, thus, should double down on the hottest Silicon Valley tech stocks after they cross one record after another on earnings strength, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

569,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.2011 Dampened by Natural DisastersWhile 2010 benefited from pent-up demand, 2011 was expected to gain from the growing popularity of mobile devices. However, growth in the first half was tempered by the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, while that in the second was affected by the flooding in Thailand.As a result, expectations continued to trend down right through the year. The SIA was originally looking for a growth of around 6% in 2011, which dropped a notch to 5.4% by mid-year. However, in December, growth expectations slipped to 1.3%.The SIA stated that the industry grew modestly in the first half (up 3.7%), naming the corporate refresh cycle, smartphone growth, and increased spending on IT infrastructure as the main drivers that were partially offset by cautious consumer spending and the disaster in Japan. Increased use of semiconductors in all end-markets and particularly in the automotive market will drive semiconductor sales, according to the SIA.However, the typical second-half pickup was not strong enough, mainly because this generally comes from back-to-school and holiday-driven spending for consumer and mobile computing devices. However, consumers bought less enthusiastically this year than in past years, due to fears of the recession continuing. Second, Europe continued to disappoint. Third, the flooding in Thailand impacted HDD manufacturers, and the ripple effect impacted PC manufacturers and thereby, semiconductor manufacturers.iSuppli also cut expectations significantly from 4.6% to 2.9%. Gartner expects 2011 sales growth of just 0.9% compared to its previous expectation of 5.1%. Other research firms, such as VLSI, IDC and IC Insights took down their estimates to 2.3%, 3.4% and 5%, respectively.Computing and Consumer Markets Remain Biggest DriversThese two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.ComputingA number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Although developed markets continue to show signs of maturing, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures, there are some points of encouragement as well.Microsoft Corp’s ([(MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and now, ultrabooks), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia is emerging as one of the strongest drivers of growth in this market.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. The cost advantages of moving to the cloud are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.The main negative for the computing market is the cannibalization by tablets, which are in the nature of consumer devices with computing functions. This is pulling down spending on core computing (PCs, notebooks and netbooks).Consumer ElectronicsWith ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is not very optimistic about consumer electronics sales this year. While it expects the overall growth rate to be around 5%, most categories are expected to slow down. Smartphones, with an expected growth rate of 22%, are expected to save the day. Tablets and e-readers are expected to help again this year with double-digit growth rates.While the CEA did not provide details for all products, it did mention that TVs would be relatively flat this year with growth if any expected to come from emerging markets. Approximately 50% of TVs sold in the U.S. will be connected compared to 12% in 2011.Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy touched bottom in the second half of 2010, although trends indicate that the recovery is slow and very gradual. Despite the much lower unemployment rate, consumers remained decidedly cautious in both the 2010 and 2011 holiday seasons. An offsetting factor has been the individual buying habits that continue to favor electronic gadgets as holiday gifts. The trend may be expected to continue, which is a positive for semiconductors serving the market.Other MarketsCommunications infrastructure spending is not likely to exceed 3-4% this year, as carriers cut investments despite growing traffic. While technology upgrades should continue, carrier spending in Europe will be impacted by fears of a recession, while in the U.S., growth could taper off following several years of strong spending. Chinese players are likely to keep the pressure on the pricing side.Automotive chipmakers should see good growth over the next few years. While the recession and natural disaster in Japan have severely impacted these players in the last few years, there are signs of growth in both the U.S. and Europe. However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.Perhaps the biggest driver of growth for automotive chip manufacturers is the increasing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation. With electronic stability control becoming mandatory in the U.S., there should be sustained demand for enabling devices.Additionally, microcontrollers for engine functions and transmission controls are becoming more popular, since they increase the efficiency of automobiles and make them more eco-friendly. Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics, Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments are the major beneficiaries here. Linear Technologies has also increased its exposure to the automotive segment, so it should gain from the growth in the market.Medical Devices is an upcoming area and adoption of semiconductors in this market may be expected to accelerate over time.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) continues to strengthen, as passenger and cargo traffic continue to increase.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. The focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Near-Term OutlookWe see continued inventory rebalancing over the next few months, which will negatively impact suppliers to the computing market. Additionally, cannibalization of traditional computing devices should continue through the year. Therefore, this end-market will have a significant negative impact on the industry. Consumer devices, such as TVs will be another area of softness.However, other consumer devices, such as tablets and smartphones, will consume a large number of ICs. The automotive market will be a positive force this year.Memory manufacturers should do well again this year, although it will continue to be a difficult year for DRAM (currently in oversupply). Logic should do well.Ever Smaller & More PowerfulThe demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Major PlayersThe major players in the industry may be broadly categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.Chip-makersAccording to preliminary estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel Corp (INTC) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) remained at number 7, with Hynix, Micron Technologies (MU) and Broadcom (BRCM) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions. Applied Micro Devices (AMD) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Equipment MakersGartner estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers increased 2% in 2010, following a 38% decline in 2009, accounting for 63.4% of total equipment sales. The overall equipment market is estimated to have increased 143% to around $41 billion in 2010. Automated test equipment (ATE) was the strongest segment (up 149%), wafer fab equipment (WFE) was close behind with a growth rate of 145%, while packaging assembly equipment (PAE) was third, having grown 127%.The very strong growth may be traced to a particularly weak 2009, when the recession impacted demand for semiconductors and capital spending was minimized. In this environment also, Applied Materials (AMAT) easily maintained its number one position, followed by ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML) and Tokyo Electron Ltd in that order. Lam Research Corp (LRCX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) Dainippon, Teradyne, Inc (TER  -  Free Report), ASM International (ASMI) Nikon and Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) were the others in the top 10.The 2011 estimates are not available yet. Exposure to the solar market and acquisitions will account for most of the changes in the top 10.FoundriesThe Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years and the top five positions have changed again, according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp , GlobalFoundries has now taken the third position in the pureplay segment, pushing the Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  to the fourth position.Also, specialty foundry Tower Semiconductor  has jumped to the fifth position. A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment – Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments’ foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.OPPORTUNITIESManufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (probably not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that also use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about these companies in 2012.We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s growth initiatives in mobile and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans. The company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Analog Devices (ADI) and ON Semiconductor (ONNN). Also, while some companies, such as Linear Technologies (LLTC), Semtech Corp  (SMTC  -  Free Report), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM  -  Free Report) will have mixed performances given their varied dependence on the auto market, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses.Linear and Maxim have also reduced their dependence on the computing market, which we see as a positive in the near term. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2012.WEAKNESSESWe believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although NAND and NOR are slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year (at best). The Thailand flooding and resultant weakness in the PC market and soft consumer spending increases risks in our opinion. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.We also remain cautious about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite the relatively strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.

"
573,KLAC,"The year 2010 started with a bang, as most companies reported results that were significantly better than the prior year, exceeding the companies’ own expectations and blowing past consensus estimates.
"
574,KLAC,"However, most of the excitement started wearing thin by the middle of the year, as order patterns and customer inventories indicated slowing demand. Industry watchers contended that the strength in the first half was more on account of pent-up demand than the beginning of another growth phase.
"
575,KLAC,"With the third quarter results, it was apparent that fears of a jobless recovery persisted. As a result, consumer spending failed to pick up in line with normal seasonality and holiday buildups dropped below expectations.
"
576,KLAC,"Net-net, global sales of semiconductor devices came in at $298.3 billion for the year, or a 31.8% increase from 2009, just slightly short of the Semiconductor Industry Association’s (SIA) expectations of a 32.8% increase.
"
577,KLAC,"The SIA stated that growth was broad-based across all major categories of semiconductors, which were each up double-digits from 2009. New products and innovations, as well as the broader application of semiconductors helped this growth. Of course, the fact that 2009 was weakened by the recession made comparisons easier in 2010.
"
578,KLAC,"Growth was also broad-based across geographies. The SIA estimates that around 54% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by the Americas with an 18% share, Japan with 15% and Europe the remaining 13%. The Americas grew the strongest in 2010, followed by Asia/Pacific, Europe and Japan in that order.
"
579,KLAC,"Expectations for 2011 are varied. While the SIA’s projection of around 6% growth this year was similar to estimates put forward by iSuppli (5.1%), Gartner (4.6%) and VLSI (4.4%), others, such as IDC and IC Insights differed widely, with expectations of 9% and 10% growth for the year, respectively.Computing and Consumer Markets Biggest Drivers
"
580,KLAC,"These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.Computing
"
581,KLAC,"A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Gone are the days when component suppliers were limited by a maturing market, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures.
"
582,KLAC,"Today, the computing business is being driven by Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT) Windows 7 for one. Even with operating systems, such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have been high.
"
583,KLAC,"Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks and tablets), the market continues to expand.

We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.Consumer Electronics
"
585,KLAC,"With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.
"
586,KLAC,"The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
587,KLAC,"The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is very upbeat about solid consumer electronics sales this year. Accordingly, these products are expected to grow 10% this year on the back of a 13% increase in 2010 to $964 billion. The CEA believes that strong demand from the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), as well as moderate spending in developed countries will drive this growth. Smartphones, TVs and mobile computing products will be the hottest products this year.
"
588,KLAC,"The CEA’s expectations are reflected in the domestic market. Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy touched bottom early in the third quarter of 2010, improving steadily thereafter. However, the recovery is slow and very gradual, resulting in a muted 2010 holiday season. An offsetting factor noticed by the CEA is individual buying habits during the holiday season that were increasingly favoring electronic gadgets, with 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most-wished-for items being electronic goods.Other Markets
"
589,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India. The SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes.
"
590,KLAC,"Medical Devices is an upcoming area and semiconductors targeted at this market are beginning to do well.
"
591,KLAC,"Earlier this year, Gartner estimated that the automotive semiconductor market would grow 4% in 2011 to $22.707 billion (the market was up 40% in 2010), as automotive inventory appeared stable. The research firm also estimated that production of light vehicles (the primary consumer of semiconductors in the auto market) would slow down to around 5% this year, after the 19.9% increase in 2010, marking the first year of sales above pre-recession levels. Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics and Freescale Semiconductor are the major beneficiaries here.
"
592,KLAC,"However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow. Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation.
"
593,KLAC,"As a result, in normal circumstances, semiconductors serving this market could have been expected to grow stronger than the industry over the next few years -- particularly since an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model. Therefore, once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years. However, the Japan crisis will hurt results this year and possibly in the next, as discussed below (“Recent Developments).
"
594,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) has started looking up, given the increasing passenger and cargo traffic.
"
595,KLAC,"The outlook for defense spending on the other hand is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.
"
596,KLAC,"Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of flash memory (particularly NAND and also NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth in this segment. However, the crisis in Japan could be a restricting factor on the supply side, limiting growth.Ever Smaller & More Powerful
"
597,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.
"
598,KLAC,"Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well (ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers).Major Players 
"
599,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.Chip-makers
"
600,KLAC,"According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Toshiba Corp were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2009. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) remained in the fourth position, as the company continued to phase off its wireless baseband business.
"
601,KLAC,"While the two research firms were slightly divided regarding the order of the next three, both estimated that that they were STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), Renesas (helped by its acquisition of NEC) and Hynix. Micron Technologies (MU) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) occupied the eighth and ninth positions. iSuppli allotted the tenth position to Elpida, while Gartner estimated that it went to Broadcom (BRCM). The most disappointing was Applied Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), which slipped from the eighth position to number twelve.Equipment Makers
"
602,KLAC,"Gartner estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers increased 2% in 2010, following a 38% decline in 2009, accounting for 63.4% of total equipment sales. The overall equipment market is estimated to have increased 143% to around $41 billion in 2010. Automated test equipment (ATE) was the strongest segment (up 149%), wafer fab equipment (WFE) was close behind with a growth rate of 145%, while packaging assembly equipment (PAE) was third, having grown 127%.
"
603,KLAC,"The very strong growth may be traced to a particularly weak 2009, when the recession impacted demand for semiconductors and capital spending was minimized. In this environment also, Applied Materials (AMAT) easily maintained its number one position, followed by ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report) and Tokyo Electron Ltd in that order. Lam Research Corp (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) Dainippon, Teradyne, Inc (TER  -  Free Report), ASM International (ASMI) Nikon and Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) were the others in the top 10.Foundries
"
604,KLAC,"The Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years and the top five positions have changed again, according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), GlobalFoundries has now taken the third position in the pureplay segment, pushing the Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI) to the fourth position.
"
605,KLAC,"Also, specialty foundry Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) has jumped to the fifth position. A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment -- Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments’ foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.Recent Developments -- The Japan Crisis
"
606,KLAC,"Japan is one of the largest producers and consumers of semiconductor devices. Therefore, the crisis in Japan has had a significant impact on the semiconductor industry.
"
607,KLAC,"On the production side, there are issues with respect to facility repair, reliable power supply (which is essential for chip production) and availability of contingent supplies, which may be hindered (given the difficulties in transportation following the disaster and the fact that Japan is accustomed to operating under the just-in-time model).
"
608,KLAC,"Again, facility repair, if it includes fab equipment would not an easy task, since the equipment is built according to specifications that could not be replaced easily. This would normally impact semiconductor supplies. However, what makes it extremely difficult to gauge the near-term impact is the fact that many large companies with Japanese operations, such as Texas Instruments, Freescale Semiconductor and NEC, among others, also have operations in other regions, to which they could probably move production temporarily.
"
609,KLAC,"The saving grace is that production in Japan was centered on the automotive industry. A March 24 report from IHS iSuppli stated that in 2010, Japan produced $11 billion of automotive infotainment electronics and $7.3 billion of automotive semiconductors, for a 35% and 32% share of the two markets, respectively. Therefore, other markets, such as communications, industrial, computing and consumer will see relative smaller impact.
"
610,KLAC,"The crisis also has an effect on equipment manufacturers as well. Given the uncertainties in the supply chain, inventory imbalances are very likely, which would prompt semiconductor manufacturers to get conservative about further capex builds. As a result, equipment manufacturers could see an increased rate of delays, push-outs and cancellations of bookings over the next few quarters. If there are no further calamities, they are likely to see improvement some time in 2012.OPPORTUNITIES
"
611,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.
"
612,KLAC,"One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. Others would be Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments. As such, we remain relatively positive about these companies in 2011.
"
613,KLAC,"We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s other growth initiatives and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans with the two big acquisitions, the company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.
"
614,KLAC,"AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.
"
615,KLAC,"The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.
"
616,KLAC,"Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Analog Devices (ADI) and ON Semiconductor (ONNN). Also, while some companies, such as Linear Technologies (LLTC), Semtech Corp (SMTC), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) will have mixed performances given their varied dependence on the auto market, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2011, representing good defensive plays as the cycle peaks.WEAKNESSES
"
617,KLAC,"We believe that the good fortune enjoyed by equipment suppliers in 2010 will not continue in 2011. All the companies here had been severely impacted by the recession in 2009, as foundries, memory and logic makers decided to cut capex. This made for easier comparisons in 2010, so most equipment makers saw triple-digit growth.
"
618,KLAC,"Growth in 2011 was expected to be driven by the memory segment, which will be impacted by the crisis in Japan. Therefore, results are likely to come in weaker than earlier projections by SEMI and Gartner.
"
619,KLAC,"We have therefore turned a bit cautious about companies like Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor and Novellus Systems, as well as test equipment providers, such as Teradyne and Agilent.
"
620,KLAC,"We started the year with a positive feeling about foundries, but have turned more cautious following the Japan crisis, since they are likely to feel the impact pretty quickly. In fact Taiwan Semiconductor was quick to lower its expectations for the year. We also believe that investors should treat other foundries, such as United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.
"
621,KLAC,"We do not anticipate significant growth in the semiconductor sector in 2011 given cyclical considerations, although we do not really see any great weaknesses either. However, we would caution investors about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite stronger demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.
"
622,KLAC,"Industry Rank Analysis 1-19-11 
"
623,KLAC,"The semiconductor is the basic building block of the modern economy. As the economy revives, demand for the chips that go into not just PCs and iPods but virtually every other product these days is going to rise. After having retrenched from building new fabrication facilities during the Great Recession, the semiconductor firms are finding that they have to step up their capital investment programs.
"
624,KLAC,"This week 8 of the top 26 “industries on the Zacks rank are either semiconductor firms or firms that make the equipment to make semiconductors. In that group I include then Scientific Instruments and Electronic Manufacturing Machinery industries.
"
625,KLAC,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 255 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well, a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts.
"
626,KLAC,"It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. This is particularly true of the semiconductor and semi-equipment area, where two of those industries have just a single firm, and two more have just two members. If there were not a big cluster of such “industries at the top of the list, I would probably not be highlighting them.
"
627,KLAC,"The Semi-equipment - Materials Systems “industry is currently at the very top of the list, with a perfect score of 1.00, and up 3 spots from last week. Last week the “average score was 2.00. However, there is only a single firm in that industry, so the perfect score is a bit less impressive than at first glance. Similarly, the number three-ranked industry, Semi-equipment - Wafer Completion has just two firms, with an average score of 1.50, unchanged from last week.
"
628,KLAC,"The biggest of these “industries by number of firms is also the one with the worst overall rank of the 8 related semi-conductor industries. It is the Electronic Manufacturing Machinery industry, with 18 members. Still, 26th spot for an industry with that many members is a very strong showing, and the industry did improve by 31 spots over the last week as the average Zacks rank fell to 2.44 from 2.72.
"
629,KLAC,"The first table below shows the Semiconductor and related stocks that hold the vaunted Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). The second table shows the Zacks #2 Ranked (Buy) firms. Most of the firms are on the small side, particularly on the Zacks #1 Rank list, but should be big enough that most of the readers of this can invest in them.
"
630,KLAC,"There are a few larger firms on the Zacks #2 Rank list, ones that even the biggest institutional investor could buy. Valuations on many of these stocks are compelling, particularly if you are willing to look out to next fiscal year’s (mostly 2012) expected earnings. Six of the eleven firms  on the Zacks #1 Rank list are sporting single digit P/Es based on those expected earnings.Number 1 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceAsml Holding Nv ASML $17,781  12.17 14.58 1.47% 0.00% $40.83 Novellus Sys NVLS $3,323  11.52 12.05 0.10% 0.00% $36.85 Cymer Inc CYMI $1,510  16.06 14.33 3.25% 0.00% $51.02 Mks Instruments MKSI $1,375  9.76 8.67 7.18% 3.28% $27.32 Entegris Inc ENTG $1,043  10.1 9.56 0.00% -0.30% $7.91 Kulicke & Soffa KLIC $695  10.36 6.5 24.75% 13.85% $9.79 Adv Energy Inds AEIS $658  9.97 8.12 3.01% -6.56% $15.20 Atmi Inc ATMI $612  17.01 14.66 0.00% 0.00% $19.50 Mts Systems MTSC $576  19.15 17.02 0.00% 0.00% $37.67 Caliper Life Sc CALP $333  N/A 88.13 100.00% 0.00% $6.61 Rudolph Tech RTEC $307  9.95 7.82 0.00% 0.00% $9.78 Ultra Clean Hld UCTT $273  10.61 7.1 0.00% 0.00% $12.42 Number 2 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceAppld Matls Inc AMAT $20,333  12.42 11.25 0.90% 1.69% $15.31 Kla-Tencor Corp KLAC $7,035  10.06 10.61 0.74% 1.49% $42.11 Lam Research LRCX $6,480  8.93 9.96 0.73% 1.30% $52.69 Skyworks Solutn SWKS $5,959  21.85 17.84 1.64% -0.23% $32.51 Mettler-Toledo MTD $4,975  20.11 17.94 0.00% 0.00% $151.57 Vishay Intertec VSH $3,033  9.88 9.21 0.00% 0.00% $16.25 Perkinelmer Inc PKI $3,015  15.77 13.99 0.34% 0.39% $25.54 Coherent Inc COHR $1,230  20.11 18.08 1.14% 2.52% $49.11 Fei Company FEIC $1,035  18.77 16.66 0.57% 0.00% $27.07 Brooks Automatn BRKS $774  10.95 11.6 2.85% 1.16% $11.85 Newport Corp NEWP $667  14.61 15.12 0.00% 0.00% $18.14 Ultratech Step UTEK $568  19.49 15.01 0.00% 14.81% $23.26 Greatbatch Inc GB $562  14.77 13.41 0.99% N/A $24.14 Photronics Inc PLAB $340  11.56 9.79 0.00% 0.00% $6.33 Iris Intl Inc IRIS $186  29.94 27.05 0.00% N/A $10.28 Towerstream Cp TWER $180  N/A 20 0.00% -2.22% $4.40 
"
631,KLAC,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
632,KLAC,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
633,KLAC,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
634,KLAC,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

635,KLAC,"Click here for the Zacks Industry Rank List: https://www.zacks.com/zrank/zrank_inds.php
"
636,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.
"
637,KLAC,"As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.
"
638,KLAC,"The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.2009 Was Better Than Expected
"
639,KLAC,"The industry performed much better in 2009 than was originally anticipated. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), worldwide sales of semiconductors were $226.3 billion in 2009, significantly better than the $219.7 billion forecasted for the year. This was a 9% decline from 2008.
"
640,KLAC,"The SIA estimates that around 52% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by Japan and the Americas with a 17% share each and the balance from Europe. The sales by geography were similar to 2008, indicating that the recession, which started in late 2008, did not result in any major change in market dynamics.
"
641,KLAC,"The SIA attributed the better-than-expected performance to much superior inventory management than in the prior downturn, as manufacturers cut production drastically instead of running the fabs at full capacity to maintain margins. New product launches and strength in the consumer and computing markets toward the end of the year also contributed.Looking Back at 2010
"
642,KLAC,"This year started with a bang, as most companies reported results that were significantly better than the prior year, exceeding the companies’ own expectations and blowing past consensus estimates.
"
643,KLAC,"However, most of the excitement started wearing thin by the middle of the year, as order patterns and customer inventories indicated slowing demand. Industry watchers contended that the strength in the first half was more on account of pent-up demand than the beginning of another growth phase.
"
644,KLAC,"With the third quarter results, it was apparent that fears of a jobless recovery persisted. As a result, consumer spending failed to pick up in line with normal seasonality and holiday buildups dropped below expectations.
"
645,KLAC,"Semiconductor companies are now even more conservative, both in terms of internal inventories and revenue projections. Therefore, while we do not expect significant positive surprises over the next few months, we believe that negative surprises will be limited, if at all.
"
646,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry Association expects semiconductor sales to increase 32.8% in 2010, 6.0% in 2011 and 3.4% in 2012, or a compounded annual growth rate of 13.4% for the period 2009 to 2012. The significant increase in 2010 is on account of weak sales in 2009, which made comparisons easier.Computing and Consumer Markets Biggest Drivers
"
647,KLAC,"These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.Computing
"
648,KLAC,"A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Gone are the days when component suppliers were limited by a maturing market, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures.
"
649,KLAC,"Today, the computing business is being driven by Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT) Windows 7 for one. Even with operating systems, such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have been very high.
"
650,KLAC,"Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks and tablets), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are also helping growth.
"
651,KLAC,"Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. The cost advantages of moving to the cloud are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry.Consumer Electronics
"
652,KLAC,"With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.
"
653,KLAC,"The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
654,KLAC,"According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 7.8% revenue decline of consumer electronic goods in 2009 was entirely on account of weaker pricing, as unit volumes of consumer goods increased around 10%.
"
655,KLAC,"Consumer confidence in the economy touched bottom early in the third quarter of 2010, improving steadily thereafter. However, the recovery is slow and very gradual, resulting in a muted 2010 holiday season. An offsetting factor noticed by the CEA is  individual buying habits this holiday season that are increasingly favoring electronic gadgets, with 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most-wished-for items being electronic goods.
"
656,KLAC,"The CEA has not refreshed full-year expectations and remains optimistic about slight growth in 2010 to $165 billion. The primary driver will be smartphones, which are expected to generate $17 billion in shipment revenue and 52 million in units. Notebooks will be the second largest driver, with shipment revenue of $14 billion and units of 30 million.
"
657,KLAC,"Blu-ray player units, which increased 155% in 2009, are expected to grow to more than 7 million units and generate $1.4 billion in shipment revenue. And finally TVs, which grew significantly in 2009, are expected to grow again in 2010 to 37 million units, driven by high definition, FPD and other advanced technologies. However, shipment revenue is expected to decline to $22 billion due to weaker pricing.Other Markets
"
658,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India. The SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes. Medical Devices is an upcoming area and some chipmakers have started developing products targeted at this market as well.
"
659,KLAC,"Gartner estimates that the automotive semiconductor market will grow 23.5% in 2010 to $19.334 billion, as automotive inventory corrections are no longer troubling sales and growth rates appear to be steady. Infineon technologies, NEC Electronics and Freescale Semiconductor are the major beneficiaries here.
"
660,KLAC,"However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow. Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation.
"
661,KLAC,"As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years. The fact that an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model is an added bonus, as once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years.
"
662,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) may be expected to start looking up, given the increasing passenger and cargo traffic. The outlook for defense spending on the other hand is not as bright.
"
663,KLAC,"Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets are seeing mixed results, depending on the customers served.
"
664,KLAC,"Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of DRAM and flash (particularly NAND and also NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth in this segment.
"
665,KLAC,"Ever Smaller & More Powerful
"
666,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.
"
667,KLAC,"Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well. ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers.Major Players
"
668,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.
"
669,KLAC,"According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Toshiba Corp were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2009. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) remained in the fourth position, as the company continued to phase off its wireless baseband business.STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) was in fifth position, followed by Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which rose from the eighth position in 2008. Hynix also gained, moving from the ninth position in 2008 to the seventh position in 2009. Japan’s Renesas slipped a couple of places to number eight. Applied Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) re-entered the top ten at number nine, followed by Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), which slipped a few places to end at number ten.
"
670,KLAC,"VLSI Research estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers declined 38.2% in 2009, following a 26% decline in 2008. Therefore, the segment has shrunk by over 50% over the past two years. North American suppliers declined 36.9%, Japanese suppliers declined 35.6%, while European suppliers declined 44.5%.
"
671,KLAC,"However, despite the difficulties related to the recession and the new trend of equipping fabs with used materials, Applied Materials (AMAT) easily maintained its number one position in 2009. Tokyo Electron Ltd moved from the third to the second position, exchanging places with ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report). Nikon Corporation was at number four, followed by KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corp (LRCX  -  Free Report). The other players in the top ten included Dainippon, ASM International N.V. (ASMI), Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) and Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) in that order.
"
672,KLAC,"The Foundry segment has undergone a major change in 2009 according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) and Singapore-based Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CHRT), the fourth position has gone to U.S.-based GlobalFoundries, which commenced business in March last year. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI) of China was pushed to the fifth position.OPPORTUNITIES
"
673,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.
"
674,KLAC,"One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. Others would be Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Samsung and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). As such, we remain upbeat about these companies in 2011.
"
675,KLAC,"The ongoing strength in these markets has also spurred growth at foundries which actually performed much better than expected in 2010 and can look forward to a good 2011 as well. As a result, we have turned bullish on the sector, encouraging investors to accumulate shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report), United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMI).
"
676,KLAC,"We are also increasingly optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s other growth initiatives and are unsure about where it wants to go with the two big acquisitions announced this year, the company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.
"
677,KLAC,"AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company has been rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operating a lower-cost model, in short, doing all the right things.
"
678,KLAC,"The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.
"
679,KLAC,"Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Linear Technology (LLTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Semtech Corp (SMTC), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM). Although some of these companies would no doubt perform better than others, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2011, representing good defensive plays.WEAKNESSES
"
680,KLAC,"We believe that the good fortune enjoyed by equipment suppliers in 2010 will not continue in 2011. All the companies here had been severely impacted by the recession, as foundries, memory and logic makers decided to cut capex.
"
681,KLAC,"Both Gartner and SEMI projected triple-digit growth in semiconductor capex spending this year and most companies are tracking in line with that forecast. However, order patterns across the segment are indicative of a slowdown in 2011, as forecasted by Gartner and SEMI. Consequently, we have now turned a bit cautious about companies like Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor Corp (KLAC  -  Free Report) and Novellus Systems (NVLS) that were very hot six months ago.
"
682,KLAC,"We do not anticipate significant growth in the semiconductor sector in 2011, although we do not really see any great weaknesses either. However, we would caution investors about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.
"
683,KLAC,"Overview 
"
684,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. For example, the PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.  
"
685,KLAC,"As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth. The Backdrop 
"
686,KLAC,"The industry has come a long way since the last downturn, when most of the players streamlined operations and transferred more routine production to low-cost locations. This in turn led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and back-end operations have shifted.  
"
687,KLAC,"When the recession hit in late 2008, semiconductor manufacturers cut production drastically instead of running the fabs at full capacity to maintain margins in the hope that the recession would blow over soon. As a result, there was no excess inventory that had to be burnt off when demand started returning. There was instead a shortage in some cases, which led to stronger pricing.  
"
688,KLAC,"Therefore, the industry performed much better in 2009 than was originally anticipated. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), worldwide sales of semiconductors were 226.3 billion in 2009, significantly better than the $219.7 billion forecasted for the year. This was a 9% decline from 2008.   
"
689,KLAC,"The SIA estimates that around 52% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by Japan and the Americas with a 17% share each and the balance from Europe. The sales by geography were similar to 2008, indicating that the recession had a similar impact on all geographies.  
"
690,KLAC,"The SIA attributed the better-than-expected performance to much superior inventory management than in the prior downturn, new product launches and strength in the consumer and PC markets toward the end of the year. These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Key End Markets 
"
691,KLAC,"The computing market is characterized by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures that have made it a lower-margin business. As a result, a number of chip companies have shifted focus to other areas. However, while it is true that the market is relatively mature and recession-impacted, there are some encouraging signs for 2010.  
"
692,KLAC,"The first is a revival in corporate spending driven by new products, such as the Windows 7 OS from Microsoft and Nehalem architecture from Intel. The power efficiencies and cost reduction afforded by these products are driving hardware upgrades among small and large enterprises alike. Since there is some pent-up demand here, the impact is all the more significant.  
"
693,KLAC,"The second is the server refresh cycle, increased virtualization, growth of cloud computing and expansion of the data center segment.  
"
694,KLAC,"The third leg of growth in the computing market is coming from mobile computing platforms (although netbooks, tablets and MIDs are treated as consumer items by some). The longer term outlook for this market-expansive segment is extremely bright, although the remainder of 2010 looks cloudy at present, mainly due to inventory builds and uncertain consumer spending.  
"
695,KLAC,"The consumer electronics market is growing in importance, especially gadgets such as LCD TVs, blu-ray players, smartphones and netbooks. The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins. According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 7.8% revenue decline in 2009 was entirely on account of weaker pricing, as unit volumes of consumer goods increased around 10%. The CEA has revised upwards its initial expectations for 2010 and now expects the market to grow 3% in 2010 to $174.9 billion, compared to previous expectations of $165 billion. Total revenues are expected to reach $182 billion by 2011.  
"
696,KLAC,"Mobile computing platforms, such as notebooks and tablets are expected to grow into the main drivers of market growth by next year, reaching $26 billion in shipment revenue. According to previous estimates, notebooks alone were expected to generate $14 billion in 2010. The other major driver is expected to be wireless handsets (contributing $26 billion in profits by 2011). Smartphones remain the major driver here, with shipment units reaching 54 million by year-end (previous estimate 52 million). By 2011, the CEA expects shipments to reach 66 million and generate $19.6 billion in revenue. The pricing pressure on digital displays is expected to continue, although volume expectations were doubled to 2.1 million. More than 6 million units ($7 billion in revenue) are expected by 2011. Other growth areas will be 3DTVs, Blu-ray players and eReaders. Communications infrastructure spending is currently focused on 3G and 4G rollouts. In the U.S., 4G spending is at its peak, with Sprint (S) in the process of rolling out its network and Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) ramping up spending. In China, the three major carriers, China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile, are rolling out their 3G networks. Spending on 4G has yet to gain momentum. In India, carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are also rolling out 3G infrastructure. Increasing data volumes and higher data speeds are primarily responsible for the rapid adoption of new technology in this market. Consequently, semiconductor companies with a communications infrastructure focus should see good growth opportunities for the rest of the year and in 2011. Medical Devices is an upcoming area and some IC makers have started developing products targeted at this market as well. Some of the target products here include sensors for ICDs and other procedure-specific equipment, as well as equipment of a fixed nature, such as for MRI purposes. Notable here is the improved spending environment for MRI and other capital equipment, which had been hit by the recession.  
"
697,KLAC,"""Light vehicles"" is the section of the automotive market that primarily consumes semiconductors. Gartner expects this segment to grow 13.5% in 2010 to 67 million units (production had slipped 11.8% in 2009). The overall market for semiconductors serving the automotive market is expected to grow 23.5% in 2010, following a 21.7% decline in 2009. Further evidence of a recovery is in the stabilization of inventories, which started declining towards the end of 2008. China is one of the fastest growing markets for automobile production, having contributed 20% of global production in 2009. Semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages.   
"
698,KLAC,"The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation. The fact that an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model is an added bonus, as once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years. This leads to a stable business model. Infineon Technologies, NEC Electronics, Freescale Semiconductor have significant presence in the automotive market and should see strong growth going forward.  
"
699,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets depend on government spending and policy making and current trends indicate that the strength in defense spending will continue. However, current spending continues to be targeted at terrorist activity, so spending on intelligence systems, surveillance systems and reconnaissance systems remain in focus. Companies offering sophisticated weapons are not doing as good. Commercial aerospace remains affected by tight lending conditions, although the situation has started improving. Demand has increased rapidly, due to growing traffic across the world. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets are seeing gradually improving results. Ever Smaller and More Powerful
"
700,KLAC,"Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of DRAM and flash (both NAND and NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth.  
"
701,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic. Within SoCs, both application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs) are expected to do well. ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers. Major Players 
"
702,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries. 
"
703,KLAC,"According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp. (INTC), Samsung and Toshiba Corp were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2009. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) remained in the fourth position, as the company continued to phase off its wireless baseband business. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) was in fifth position, followed by Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which rose from the eighth position in 2008. Hynix also gained, moving from the ninth position in 2008 to the seventh position in 2009. Japan's Renesas slipped a couple of places to number eight. Applied Micro Devices (AMD) re-entered the top ten at number nine, followed by Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), which slipped a few places to end at number ten.
"
704,KLAC,"VLSI Research estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers declined 38.2% in 2009, following a 26% decline in 2008. Therefore, the segment has shrunk by over 50% over the past two years. North American suppliers declined 36.9%, Japanese suppliers declined 35.6%, while European suppliers declined 44.5%. However, despite the difficulties related to the recession and the new trend of equipping fabs with used materials, Applied Materials (AMAT) easily maintained its number one position in 2009. Tokyo Electron Ltd moved from the third to the second position, exchanging places with ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML). Nikon Corporation was at number four, followed by KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). The other players in the top ten included Dainippon, ASM International N.V. (ASMI), Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) and Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) in that order.  
"
705,KLAC,"Gartner estimates that the semiconductor capital equipment sales will grow 113.2% in 2010, with wafer fab equipment growing 113.3%, packaging and assembly equipment growing 104.7% and ATE growing 133.1%. However, the research organization cautions against a much softer 2011, with growth in the above markets dropping to 6.6%, 7.2%, 0.7% and 12.6%, respectively. Growth is currently expected to stabilize in 2012 and decline thereafter.  
"
706,KLAC,"The Foundry segment went through a major change in 2009 according to recently-announced research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp.  and Singapore-based Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CHRT), the fourth position has gone to GlobalFoundries, which commenced business in March last year. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.  of China was pushed to the fifth position. OPPORTUNITIES
"
707,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a large portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.
"
708,KLAC,"We believe equipment suppliers will be big beneficiaries of the ongoing recovery and we are bullish on the sector. All the companies here had been severely impacted by the recession, as foundries, memory and logic makers decided to cut capex. However, growth estimates for the sector have gone up from strong double-digits to triple digits. This is largely because of capex cuts in 2009 that resulted in pent up demand.  
"
709,KLAC,"We are, however likely to see increased use of old and refurbished equipment. Among the equipment suppliers, we particularly like Applied Materials, not just because it is one of the largest equipment makers, but also because of its position in the solar device equipment market, as well as its existing refurbished tools business. Granted that there are some issues in the solar business right now, but we remain positive about longer-term prospects. We are also optimistic about KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Novellus Systems (NVLS) and believe they will do well both in terms of revenue and profit growth in 2010.  
"
710,KLAC,"Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Linear Technology (LLTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Semtech Corp. (SMTC  -  Free Report), Intersil Corp. (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM  -  Free Report), which are seeing very strong demand. Although some of these companies could see a faster recovery than others, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses. Hence, the sector should do very well in 2010.  
"
711,KLAC,"Microprocessors are a big market dominated by a few players. We are positive about Intel Corp because of its market position, superior innovation, effective strategies and strong cash generating ability. We remain a little concerned about the legal tussles with NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), which could come to a head in September.
"
712,KLAC,"Advanced Micro Devices on the other hand, is low on cash and market position, although the companys new product roadmap, aggressive pricing, the foundry spin-off and promise of positive cash flow in 2010 indicate upside for the stock. 
"
713,KLAC,"It is hard to ignore ARM Holdings (ARMH) in this space, whose power-efficient low-performance chips dominate the growing cell phone market and are also gaining popularity in the nascent MID market. WEAKNESSES 
"
714,KLAC,"The Asian foundries will operate at full capacity this year, but order fulfillment could still be a challenge due to low investment in capex during the recessionary environment. Consequently, we believe that foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report), United Microelectronics Corp.  and Semiconductor Manufacturing Int'l  will see limited upside this year, despite very strong demand. Similar will be the position at memory manufacturers, such as Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Hynix.  
"
715,KLAC,"We have recently turned negative on NVIDIA Corp due to market dynamics impacting the company. NVIDIA remains dominant in the discrete graphics chip market, where its chips are unparalleled. However, research shows that the demand for cheaper integrated solutions is on the rise. We also note that the company wrote down its inventory by a significant amount in the last quarter, seeming to indicate the need to adopt aggressive pricing to sell it off. SIA Forecast 2010
"
716,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry Association expects semiconductor sales to increase 28.4% in 2010 to $290.5 billion (previous expectation was for a 10.2% increase). Revenue is currently expected to touch $308.7 billion, or a 6.3% increase in 2011 (previous expectation was for an 8.4% increase in 2011). The SIA also expects the industry to grow another 2.9% in 2012 to $317.8 billion. 
"
717,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.
"
718,KLAC,"As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.
"
719,KLAC,"The industry has come a long way since the last downturn, when most of the players streamlined operations and transferred more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.Lesson Learned in the Industry
"
720,KLAC,"Past experience has been put to good use this time around. When the recession hit in late 2008, semiconductor manufacturers cut production drastically instead of running the fabs at full capacity to maintain margins and hoping that the recession would blow over. As a result, there was no excess inventory that had to be burned off when demand started returning. There was instead a shortage in some cases, which led to stronger pricing.
"
721,KLAC,"As a result, the industry performed much better in 2009 than was originally anticipated. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), worldwide sales of semiconductors were $226.3 billion in 2009, significantly better than the $219.7 billion forecasted for the year. This was a 9% decline from 2008.
"
722,KLAC,"The SIA estimates that around 52% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by Japan and the Americas with a 17% share each, and the balance from Europe. The sales by geography were similar to 2008, indicating that the recession did not result in any major change in market dynamics.
"
723,KLAC,"The SIA attributed the better-than-expected performance to much superior inventory management than in the prior downturn, new product launches and strength in the consumer and PC markets toward the end of the year. These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold.Expanding Reach in Computing and Consumer Markets
"
724,KLAC,"The computing market is characterized by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures that have made it a lower-margin business. As a result, a number of chip companies have shifted focus to other areas.
"
725,KLAC,"However, while it is true that the market is relatively mature and recession-impacted, there are some encouraging signs for 2010. The first is a revival in enterprise spending, which is being driven by new product cycles and some pent-up demand. The second is the server refresh cycle, growth of cloud computing and virtualization, and changes in data center operations. The third is the strength in mobile computing platforms (although some of the latest models of netbooks, tablets and MIDs are treated as consumer items).
"
726,KLAC,"The consumer electronics market is growing in importance, especially gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones and netbooks. The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
727,KLAC,"According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 7.8% revenue decline in consumer electronic goods for 2009 was entirely on account of weaker pricing, as unit volumes of consumer goods increased around 10%.
"
728,KLAC,"However, the CEA is optimistic about slight growth in 2010 to $165 billion. The primary driver will be smartphones, which are expected to generate $17 billion in shipment revenue and 52 million in units. Notebooks will be the second largest driver, with shipment revenue of $14 billion and units of 30 million.
"
729,KLAC,"Blu-ray player units, which increased 155% in 2009, are expected to grow to more than 7 million units and generate $1.4 billion in shipment revenue. And finally TVs, which grew significantly in 2009, are expected to grow again in 2010 to 37 million units, driven by high definition, FPD and other advanced technologies. However, shipment revenue is expected to decline to $22 billion due to weaker pricing.Other Markets
"
730,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India and the SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales into the market. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes. Medical Devices is an upcoming area and some chipmakers have started developing products targeted at this market as well. 
"
731,KLAC,"The recovery in the automobile market is slow, with several of the large companies facing temporary issues and growing inventories. The longer-term prospects remain bright, since design activity is strengthening. Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation.
"
732,KLAC,"As a result, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years. The fact that an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model is an added bonus, as once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years.
"
733,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are dependent on government spending and policy making and current trends indicate that the strength in defense spending will continue. However, current spending continues to be targeted at terrorist activity, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger.
"
734,KLAC,"Companies offering sophisticated weapons are not doing as well. Commercial aerospace remains affected by tight lending conditions, although the situation has started improving. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets are seeing mixed results, depending on the customers served.
"
735,KLAC,"Given the end-markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of DRAM and flash (both NAND and NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth in this segment.

"
756,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.
"
757,KLAC,"As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions, and so forth.
"
758,KLAC,"The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.
"
759,KLAC," 2010 Grew Off a Recession-Dampened 2009
"
760,KLAC,"The year 2010 started with a bang, as most companies reported results that were significantly better than the prior year, exceeding the companies’ own guidance and blowing past consensus estimates.
"
761,KLAC,"However, most of the excitement started wearing thin by the middle of the year, as order patterns and customer inventories indicated slowing demand. Industry watchers contended that the strength in the first half was more on account of pent-up demand than the beginning of another growth phase.
"
762,KLAC,"With the third quarter results, it was apparent that fears of a jobless recovery were not off the mark. As a result, consumer spending failed to pick up in line with normal seasonality and holiday buildups dropped below expectations.
"
763,KLAC,"Net-net, global sales of semiconductor devices came in at $298.3 billion for the year, or a 31.8% increase from 2009, just slightly short of the Semiconductor Industry Association’s (SIA) expectations of a 32.8% increase.
"
764,KLAC,"The SIA stated that growth was broad-based across all major categories of semiconductors, which were each up double-digits from 2009. New products and innovations, as well as the broader application of semiconductors helped this growth. Of course, the fact that 2009 was weakened by the recession made comparisons easier in 2010.
"
765,KLAC,"Growth was also broad-based across geographies. The SIA estimates that around 54% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by the Americas with an 18% share, Japan with 15% and Europe the remaining 13%. The Americas grew the strongest in 2010, followed by the Asia/Pacific, Europe and Japan in that order.
"
766,KLAC," So Far in 2011
"
767,KLAC,"Expectations for 2011 are close to the SIA’s projection of around 5.4% growth this year. Specifically, estimates put forward by iSuppli (7.2%), Gartner (5.1%) and VLSI (4.4%) have not changed much, while others, such as IDC and IC Insights. significantly lowered expectations from 9% and 10%, respectively, to 1% and 5%, respectively.
"
768,KLAC,"The SIA stated that the industry grew modestly in the first half (up 3.7%), naming the corporate refresh cycle, smartphone growth, increased spending on It infrastructure as the main drivers that were partially offset by cautious consumer spending and the disaster in Japan. Increased use of semiconductors in all end markets and particularly in the automotive market will drive semiconductor sales, according to the SIA.
"
769,KLAC," Computing and Consumer Markets Biggest Drivers
"
770,KLAC,"These two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.
"
771,KLAC," Computing
"
772,KLAC,"A number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Although developed markets continue to show signs of maturing, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures, there are some points of encouragement as well.
"
773,KLAC," Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to launch with important changes that could speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as Apple, Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.
"
774,KLAC,"Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks and tablets), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia is emerging as one of the strongest drivers of growth in this market.
"
775,KLAC,"Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. The cost advantages of moving to the cloud are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.
"
776,KLAC,"The main negative for the computing market is the cannibalization by tablets, which are in the nature of consumer devices with computing functions. This is pulling down spending on core computing (PCs, notebooks and netbooks).Consumer Electronics
"
777,KLAC,"With ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.
"
778,KLAC,"The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
779,KLAC,"The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is very upbeat about solid consumer electronics sales this year. Accordingly, it sees shipment revenue increasing 5.6% from 2010 to $190 billion (assuming a GDP growth rate of 2.4%), an improvement over its prior expectations of a 3.5% increase in shipment revenue. Shipments are expected to grow to an all-time high of $197 billion in 2012. The CEA believes that smartphone sales will grow 45% this year, representing the most significant driver of consumer electronics sales in 2011.
"
780,KLAC,"E-reader sales are expected to double, reaching 16.5 million in shipment volumes and $1.8 billion in revenue. Tablets are expected to grow far more than initial expectations, with a number of new vendors entering the market. The expectation for the TV market is mixed. Since penetration of digital TVs is quite high (88%) in the U.S., the CEA expects a modest decline this year. However, network-enabled and 3D TVs are expected to grow (expectations for 3D TV are up from 1.9 million units to 3.6 million units). Digital cameras are expected to grow 3%.
"
781,KLAC,"The CEA’ expectations are reflected in the domestic market. Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy touched bottom early in the third quarter of 2010, improving steadily thereafter. However, the recovery is slow and very gradual, resulting in a muted 2010 holiday season. 
"
782,KLAC,"An offsetting factor noticed by the CEA is individual buying habits during the holiday season that were increasingly favoring electronic gadgets, with 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most-wished-for items being electronic goods. The trend may be expected to continue, which is a positive for semiconductors serving the market.
"
783,KLAC," Other Markets
"
784,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending continues to be driven by buildouts in China and India. The SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes.
"
785,KLAC,"Medical Devices is an upcoming area, and adoption of semiconductors in this market may be expected to accelerate over time.
"
786,KLAC,"Earlier this year, Gartner estimated that the automotive semiconductor market would grow 4% in 2011 to $22.707 billion (the market was up 40% in 2010), as automotive inventory appeared stable. The research firm also estimated that production of light vehicles (the primary consumer of semiconductors in the auto market) would slow down to around 5% this year, after the 19.9% increase in 2010, marking the first year of sales above pre-recession levels. Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics and Freescale Semiconductor are the major beneficiaries here.
"
787,KLAC,"However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow. Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation.
"
788,KLAC,"As a result, in normal circumstances, semiconductors serving this market should grow stronger than the industry over the next few years. Particularly so, since an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model. Therefore, once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years. While the Japan crisis will hurt results this year, it appears that the impact will be much less than expected earlier.
"
789,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) continues to strengthen, as passenger and cargo traffic continue to increase.
"
790,KLAC,"The outlook for defense spending on the other hand is not as bright. Moreover, the focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.
"
791,KLAC,"Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of flash memory (particularly NAND and also NOR) will be stronger than other segments in 2011. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth. However, the crisis in Japan is likely to serve as an offsetting factor.
"
792,KLAC," Ever Smaller & More Powerful
"
793,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.
"
794,KLAC,"Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well (ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers).
"
795,KLAC," Major Players
"
796,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.
"
797,KLAC," Chip-Makers
"
798,KLAC,"According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Toshiba Corp were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2010. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) remained in the fourth position, as the company continued to phase off its wireless baseband business.
"
799,KLAC,"While the two research firms were slightly divided regarding the order of the next three, both estimated that that they were STMicroelectronics (STM), Renesas (helped by its acquisition of NEC) and Hynix. Micron Technologies (MU) and Qualcomm (QCOM) occupied the eighth and ninth positions. iSuppli allotted the tenth position to Elpida, while Gartner estimated that it went to Broadcom (BRCM). The most disappointing was Applied Micro Devices (AMD), which slipped from the eighth position to number twelve.
"
800,KLAC," Equipment Makers
"
801,KLAC,"Gartner estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers increased 2% in 2010, following a 38% decline in 2009, accounting for 63.4% of total equipment sales. The overall equipment market is estimated to have increased 143% to around $41 billion in 2010. Automated test equipment (ATE) was the strongest segment (up 149%), wafer fab equipment (WFE) was close behind with a growth rate of 145%, while packaging assembly equipment (PAE) was third, having grown 127%.
"
802,KLAC,"The very strong growth may be traced to a particularly weak 2009, when the recession impacted demand for semiconductors and capital spending was minimized. In this environment also, Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) easily maintained its number one position, followed by ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report) and Tokyo Electron Ltd in that order. Lam Research Corp (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) Dainippon, Teradyne, Inc (TER  -  Free Report), ASM International (ASMI) Nikon and Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) were the others in the top 10.
"
803,KLAC,"Foundries
"
804,KLAC,"The Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years and the top five positions have changed again, according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), GlobalFoundries has now taken the third position in the pureplay segment, pushing the Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI) to the fourth position. 
"
805,KLAC,"Also, specialty foundry Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) has jumped to the fifth position. A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment – Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments’ foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.
"
806,KLAC," Impact of Japan Crisis on 2011
"
807,KLAC,"Japan is one of the largest producers and consumers of semiconductor devices. Therefore, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan has had a significant impact on the semiconductor industry.
"
808,KLAC,"On the production side, there were issues with respect to facility repair, reliable power supply (which is essential for chip production) and availability of contingent supplies, which may be hindered (given the difficulties in transportation following the disaster and the fact that Japan is accustomed to operating under the just-in-time model). Again, facility repair, if it includes fab equipment would not be an easy task, since the equipment is built according to specifications that could not be replaced easily. This would normally impact semiconductor supplies. However, many large companies with Japanese operations, such as Texas Instruments, Freescale Semiconductor and NEC, among others, also have operations in other regions, to which they moved production temporarily.
"
809,KLAC,"Additionally, production in Japan was centered on the automotive industry. A March 24 report from IHS iSuppli stated that in 2010, Japan produced $11 billion of automotive infotainment electronics and $7.3 billion of automotive semiconductors, for a 35% and 32% share of the two markets, respectively. Therefore, other markets, such as communications, industrial, computing and consumer would see a relatively smaller impact.
"
810,KLAC,"Although the crisis was very well managed to minimize disruptions, there were inventory imbalances that made semiconductor manufacturers more conservative about further capex builds. As a result, equipment manufacturers continue to see an increased rate of delays, push-outs and cancellations of bookings.
"
811,KLAC," OPPORTUNITIES
"
812,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.
"
813,KLAC,"One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. Others would be Qualcomm Samsung and Texas Instruments. As such, we remain relatively positive about these companies in 2011.
"
814,KLAC,"We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s other growth initiatives and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans, the company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.
"
815,KLAC,"AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.
"
816,KLAC,"The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.
"
817,KLAC,"Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Analog Devices (ADI) and ON Semiconductor (ONNN). Also, while some companies, such as Linear Technologies (LLTC), Semtech Corp (SMTC), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) will have mixed performances given their varied dependence on the auto market, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2011, representing good defensive plays as the computing market performance falls below expectations. 
"
818,KLAC,"WEAKNESSES
"
819,KLAC,"We believe that the good fortune enjoyed by equipment suppliers in 2010 will not be sustained in 2011. All the companies here had been severely impacted by the recession in 2009, as foundries, memory and logic makers decided to cut capex. This made for easier comparisons in 2010, so most equipment makers saw triple-digit growth.
"
820,KLAC,"Growth in 2011 was expected to be driven by the memory segment, which was first impacted by the crisis in Japan and then by slowing demand for computing devices and sagging consumer confidence. Therefore, results are likely to come in weaker than earlier projections by SEMI and Gartner.  
"
821,KLAC,"We have therefore turned a bit cautious about companies like Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor and Novellus Systems, as well as test equipment providers, such as Teradyne and Agilent.
"
822,KLAC,"We started the year with a positive feeling about foundries, but have turned more cautious following the Japan crisis and ebbing consumer confidence. The weakness in the PC market has made matters worse. In fact Taiwan Semiconductor was quick to lower its expectations immediately after the Japan quake. We also continue to believe that investors should treat other foundries, such as United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.
"
823,KLAC,"We do not anticipate significant growth in the semiconductor sector in 2011, given the mid-cycle correction, although we do not really see any great weaknesses either. However, we would caution investors about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite the strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.
"
824,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The industry has come a long way since the last downturn, when most of the players streamlined operations and transferred more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.Lesson Learned in the IndustryPast experience has been put to good use this time around. When the recession hit in late 2008, semiconductor manufacturers cut production drastically instead of running the fabs at full capacity to maintain margins and hoping that the recession would blow over. As a result, there was no excess inventory that had to be burnt off when demand started returning. There was instead a shortage in some cases, which led to stronger pricing.As a result, the industry performed much better in 2009 than was originally anticipated. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), worldwide sales of semiconductors were $226.3 billion in 2009, significantly better than the $219.7 billion forecasted for the year. This was a 9% decline from 2008.The SIA estimates that around 52% of revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan), followed by Japan and the Americas with a 17% share each and the balance from Europe. The sales by geography were similar to 2008, indicating that the recession did not result in any major change in market dynamics.The SIA attributed the better-than-expected performance to much superior inventory management than in the prior downturn, new product launches and strength in the consumer and PC markets toward the end of the year. These two end markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold.Expanding ReachThe computing market is characterized by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures that have made it a lower-margin business. As a result, a number of chip companies have shifted focus to other areas.However, while it is true that the market is relatively mature and recession-impacted, there are some encouraging signs for 2010. The first is a revival in enterprise spending, which is being driven by new product cycles and some pent-up demand. The second is the server refresh cycles, growth of cloud computing and changes in data center operations. The third is the strength in mobile computing platforms (although some of the latest models of netbooks, tablets and MIDs are treated as consumer items).The consumer electronics market is growing in importance, especially gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones and netbooks. The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day.Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins. According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 7.8% revenue decline in 2009 was entirely on account of weaker pricing, as unit volumes of consumer goods increased around 10%. However, the CEA is optimistic about slight growth in 2010 to $165 billion.The primary driver will be smartphones, which are expected to generate $17 billion in shipment revenue and 52 million in units. Notebooks will be the second largest driver, with shipment revenue of $14 billion and units of 30 million. Blu-ray player units, which increased 155% in 2009, are expected to grow to more than 7 million units and generate $1.4 billion in shipment revenue. And finally TVs, which grew significantly in 2009, are expected to grow again in 2010 to 37 million units, driven by high definition, FPD and other advanced technologies. However, shipment revenue is expected to decline to $22 billion due to weaker pricing.Other MarketsCommunications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China and India and the SIA expects infrastructure spending in these geographies to remain the major driver of semiconductor sales into the market. The domestic market will be driven by increasing data volumes. Medical Devices is an upcoming area and some IC (integrated chip) makers have started developing products targeted at this market as well.The recovery in the automobile market is slow, with several of the large companies facing temporary issues and growing inventories. The longer-term prospects remain bright, since design activity is strengthening. Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers serving this market have a few advantages. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation.The fact that an automobile model has a significantly longer life than a consumer device model is an added bonus, as once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years. This leads to a stable business model.The aerospace and defense markets are dependent on government spending and policy making and current trends indicate that the strength in defense spending will continue. However, current spending continues to be targeted at terrorist activity, so spending on intelligence systems and less sophisticated weaponry is stronger.Companies offering sophisticated weapons are not doing as well. Commercial aerospace remains affected by tight lending conditions, although the situation has started improving. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets are seeing mixed results, depending on the customers served.Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we believe that manufacturers of DRAM and flash (both NAND and NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth in this segment.Ever Smaller & More PowerfulThe demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Within SoCs, both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well. ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers.The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers, equipment and material suppliers, and foundries. Since numbers for 2009 have yet to be released, we present a summary of market positions in 2008. We do not expect significant changes among the top ten, although exact positions may vary depending on how well each company has dealt with the recession and increased competition in 2009.According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Toshiba Corp were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2008. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) dropped to the fourth position, as the company decided to phase off its wireless baseband business. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) was in fifth position, followed by Japan’s Renesas. Sony (SNE), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Hynix stepped into the top ten for the first time, filling the next three positions. Infineon (INFY  -  Free Report) stayed at number 10.The top three equipment suppliers in 2008 according to VLSI Research were Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report) and Tokyo Electron Ltd. KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corp (LRCX  -  Free Report), Nikon, Canon (CAJ), Hitachi (HIT), Dainippon and Novellus Systems (NVLS) are the others in the top ten. The research firm estimates that the top fifteen equipment suppliers generated around 70% of 2008 sales. Around 46% of equipment sales were from the U.S., Japan accounted for 36%, while the rest came from Europe.All of the top five foundries are located in Asia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) and United Microelectronics Corp , the two largest players in 2008, are located in Taiwan. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CHRT) is located in Singapore, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI) in China and Vanguard again in Taiwan.OPPORTUNITIESManufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers.Equipment suppliers will be big beneficiaries of the recovery and we are bullish on the sector. All the companies here had been severely impacted by the recession, as foundries, memory and logic makers decided to cut capex. However, both Gartner and IC Insights have projected a 45-55% increase in semiconductor capex spending in 2010.We are, however likely to see increased use of old and refurbished equipment. Among the equipment suppliers, we particularly like Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), not just because it is one of the largest equipment makers, but also because of its position in the solar device equipment market, as well as its existing refurbished tools business. We are also optimistic about KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) and Novellus Systems (NVLS) and believe they will do well both in terms of revenue and profits in 2010.The analog market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI), Semtech Corp (SMTC), Intersil Corp (ISIL), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Linear Technology (LLTC), which are seeing very strong demand. Although some of these companies could see a faster recovery than others, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses. Hence, the sector should do very well in 2010.Microprocessors are a big market dominated by a few players. We are positive about Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) because of its market position, superior innovation, effective strategies and strong cash position.However, the company’s dependence on the PC market and legal tussles with competitors are expected to have a continued negative impact on stock prices. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), on the other hand, is low on cash and market position, although the company’s competitive products, the foundry spin-off and recent agreement with Intel indicate upside for the stock.It is hard to ignore ARM Holdings (ARMH) in this space, whose power-efficient low-performance chips dominate the growing cell phone market, or NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), which continues to make waves in graphic processing chips.WEAKNESSESThe Asian foundries will operate at full capacity this year, but order fulfillment could still be a challenge due to low investment in capex during the recessionary environment. Consequently, we believe that foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report), United Microelectronics Corp  and Semiconductor Manufacturing Int'l (SMI) will see limited upside this year, despite very strong demand. Similar will be the position at memory manufacturers, such as Micron Technology (MU) and Hynix.We remain extremely positive on the semiconductor sector in 2010 and do not really see any great weaknesses. However, we remain concerned about the ones with very weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.SIA Forecast 2010The Semiconductor Industry Association has not updated its growth forecast for 2010 and 2011. The previous forecast was for sales increases of 10.2% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011.

825,KLAC,"U.S. tech companies can finally breathe easy, at least for the time being. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold. This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.Sigh of Relief for Tech Companies  President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs. However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, “We are putting the trade war on hold.”This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) alone generating $105.5 billion from China. Other companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Qualcomm, Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Biggest Gainers if Trade War is AvertedTech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Our ChoicesIt goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let’sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is the worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices.

826,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves and respond to our environment. The PCs we work on, the cars we drive, the phones we communicate with, the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies, listen to music and play games on, and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices.As environmental issues have become more of a concern today, semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption, reduce heat dissipation, capture solar energy, create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.The past decade has seen big changes in the industry, with most players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted.2011 Dampened by Natural DisastersWhile 2010 benefited from pent-up demand, 2011 was expected to gain from the growing popularity of mobile devices. However, growth in the first half was tempered by the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, while that in the second was affected by the flooding in Thailand.As a result, expectations continued to trend down right through the year. The SIA was originally looking for a growth of around 6% in 2011, which dropped a notch to 5.4% by mid-year. However, in December, growth expectations slipped to 1.3%.The SIA stated that the industry grew modestly in the first half (up 3.7%), naming the corporate refresh cycle, smartphone growth, and increased spending on IT infrastructure as the main drivers that were partially offset by cautious consumer spending and the disaster in Japan. Increased use of semiconductors in all end-markets and particularly in the automotive market will drive semiconductor sales, according to the SIA.However, the typical second-half pickup was not strong enough, mainly because this generally comes from back-to-school and holiday-driven spending for consumer and mobile computing devices. However, consumers bought less enthusiastically this year than in past years, due to fears of the recession continuing. Second, Europe continued to disappoint. Third, the flooding in Thailand impacted HDD manufacturers, and the ripple effect impacted PC manufacturers and thereby, semiconductor manufacturers.iSuppli also cut expectations significantly from 4.6% to 2.9%. Gartner expects 2011 sales growth of just 0.9% compared to its previous expectation of 5.1%. Other research firms, such as VLSI, IDC and IC Insights took down their estimates to 2.3%, 3.4% and 5%, respectively.Computing and Consumer Markets Remain Biggest DriversThese two end-markets together consume around 60% of total semiconductors sold. Therefore, they have the ability to significantly influence total sector performance.ComputingA number of factors, in combination, are bringing about a complete turnaround in the computing market. Although developed markets continue to show signs of maturing, worsened by commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures, there are some points of encouragement as well.Microsoft Corp’s ([(MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows 7 continues to drive sales at enterprise customers, while Windows 8 is expected to speed up adoption of mobile devices. Even with operating systems, such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL) Macintosh platform gaining popularity, and cloud alternatives such as Google Inc.’s (GOOG) Chrome coming to market, Windows 7 adoption rates have held up relatively well.Second, Apple’s run of success is a big driver, since the Macintosh OS runs on Apple devices alone, which means more hardware and consequently, more semiconductor devices being sold. Third, with the advent of less sophisticated and ultra mobile devices (netbooks, tablets and now, ultrabooks), the market continues to expand. Fourth, increased computerization in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia is emerging as one of the strongest drivers of growth in this market.Perhaps the biggest driver of business is the growth in the data center segment, which has increased focus on servers, storage and networking equipment that consume semiconductors of the high-end variety. The cost advantages of moving to the cloud are encouraging many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some large organizations to transfer either a part or the whole of their operations to the cloud. We expect this change to be a major driver of growth for the industry in the foreseeable future.The main negative for the computing market is the cannibalization by tablets, which are in the nature of consumer devices with computing functions. This is pulling down spending on core computing (PCs, notebooks and netbooks).Consumer ElectronicsWith ultra-portable computing devices gaining popularity, the distinction between consumer and computing is blurring in some cases. Of course, the consumer electronics market also includes other gadgets such as LCD TVs, Blu-ray players and smartphones.The problem with this segment being a major driver of revenue is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is not very optimistic about consumer electronics sales this year. While it expects the overall growth rate to be around 5%, most categories are expected to slow down. Smartphones, with an expected growth rate of 22%, are expected to save the day. Tablets and e-readers are expected to help again this year with double-digit growth rates.While the CEA did not provide details for all products, it did mention that TVs would be relatively flat this year with growth if any expected to come from emerging markets. Approximately 50% of TVs sold in the U.S. will be connected compared to 12% in 2011.Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy touched bottom in the second half of 2010, although trends indicate that the recovery is slow and very gradual. Despite the much lower unemployment rate, consumers remained decidedly cautious in both the 2010 and 2011 holiday seasons. An offsetting factor has been the individual buying habits that continue to favor electronic gadgets as holiday gifts. The trend may be expected to continue, which is a positive for semiconductors serving the market.Other MarketsCommunications infrastructure spending is not likely to exceed 3-4% this year, as carriers cut investments despite growing traffic. While technology upgrades should continue, carrier spending in Europe will be impacted by fears of a recession, while in the U.S., growth could taper off following several years of strong spending. Chinese players are likely to keep the pressure on the pricing side.Automotive chipmakers should see good growth over the next few years. While the recession and natural disaster in Japan have severely impacted these players in the last few years, there are signs of growth in both the U.S. and Europe. However, we may see some changes in days to come, since nearly a fifth of vehicle production has moved to China and we may expect more to follow.Perhaps the biggest driver of growth for automotive chip manufacturers is the increasing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation. With electronic stability control becoming mandatory in the U.S., there should be sustained demand for enabling devices.Additionally, microcontrollers for engine functions and transmission controls are becoming more popular, since they increase the efficiency of automobiles and make them more eco-friendly. Infineon Technologies, Renesas Electronics, Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments are the major beneficiaries here. Linear Technologies has also increased its exposure to the automotive segment, so it should gain from the growth in the market.Medical Devices is an upcoming area and adoption of semiconductors in this market may be expected to accelerate over time.The aerospace and defense markets are considerably dependent on government spending and policy making. The commercial aerospace market (which lags an economic downturn or recovery) continues to strengthen, as passenger and cargo traffic continue to increase.The outlook for defense spending, on the other hand, is not as bright. The focus on terrorist activity remains, so spending on intelligence systems and basic weaponry is stronger. A longer-term driver for semiconductor manufacturers is the growing importance of electronic weaponry. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets continue to see mixed results, depending on the customers served.Near-Term OutlookWe see continued inventory rebalancing over the next few months, which will negatively impact suppliers to the computing market. Additionally, cannibalization of traditional computing devices should continue through the year. Therefore, this end-market will have a significant negative impact on the industry. Consumer devices, such as TVs will be another area of softness.However, other consumer devices, such as tablets and smartphones, will consume a large number of ICs. The automotive market will be a positive force this year.Memory manufacturers should do well again this year, although it will continue to be a difficult year for DRAM (currently in oversupply). Logic should do well.Ever Smaller & More PowerfulThe demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic.Major PlayersThe major players in the industry may be broadly categorized into chipmakers (OEMs-whether fabless or otherwise), equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.Chip-makersAccording to preliminary estimates from IHS iSuppli, Intel Corp (INTC) and Samsung remained the top two semiconductor suppliers in 2011, while Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) overtook Toshiba Corp. to attain the number three position (helped by the National Semiconductor acquisition).Renesas remained at number 5, followed by Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which moved up from the ninth position in 2010. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) remained at number 7, with Hynix, Micron Technologies (MU) and Broadcom (BRCM) in the eighth, ninth and tenth positions. Applied Micro Devices (AMD) crept up from number 12 to number 11.Equipment MakersGartner estimates that semiconductor equipment sales by the top ten suppliers increased 2% in 2010, following a 38% decline in 2009, accounting for 63.4% of total equipment sales. The overall equipment market is estimated to have increased 143% to around $41 billion in 2010. Automated test equipment (ATE) was the strongest segment (up 149%), wafer fab equipment (WFE) was close behind with a growth rate of 145%, while packaging assembly equipment (PAE) was third, having grown 127%.The very strong growth may be traced to a particularly weak 2009, when the recession impacted demand for semiconductors and capital spending was minimized. In this environment also, Applied Materials (AMAT) easily maintained its number one position, followed by ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML) and Tokyo Electron Ltd in that order. Lam Research Corp (LRCX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) Dainippon, Teradyne, Inc (TER  -  Free Report), ASM International (ASMI) Nikon and Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) were the others in the top 10.The 2011 estimates are not available yet. Exposure to the solar market and acquisitions will account for most of the changes in the top 10.FoundriesThe Foundry segment has undergone significant changes over the past few years and the top five positions have changed again, according to research from IC Insights. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) remains the leader by far, followed by Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corp , GlobalFoundries has now taken the third position in the pureplay segment, pushing the Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  to the fourth position.Also, specialty foundry Tower Semiconductor  has jumped to the fifth position. A few clear leaders are emerging in the foundry segment – Taiwan Semiconductor at the trailing edge, GlobalFoundries at the leading edge and Tower Semiconductor in the specialty category (analog). Additionally, Intel and Texas Instruments’ foundries make them two strong contenders with leading edge capabilities.OPPORTUNITIESManufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian manufacturers. However, a significant portion of the intellectual property remains with the domestic companies.One of the primary beneficiaries of the growth in mobile phones, tablets and the like is ARM Holdings (ARMH), with its power-efficient low-performance chip architecture that dominates the growing mobile phone and tablet markets. With new versions of ARM chips coming to market, it is likely that the chips will gradually spread to the server segment as well (probably not a 2012 phenomenon).Others would be Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments, all of which are big semiconductor manufacturers that also use ARM architecture. As such, we remain relatively positive about these companies in 2012.We are also optimistic about Intel and AMD, given their focus on the data center segment. Although we are a wee bit cautious on Intel’s growth initiatives in mobile and believe that execution will be key to delivering on its plans. The company’s market position, cash balance, technology lead, and management strategy and execution are positives in our opinion.AMD is also worth watching, as management has been delivering on its promises. Moreover, the company is seeing some real success in its graphics business, which should complement initiatives targeted at rationalizing its debt, increasing focus on R&D and operation of a lower-cost model.The analog and mixed-signal market is dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins than digital products. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles. These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise.Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments, Analog Devices (ADI) and ON Semiconductor (ONNN). Also, while some companies, such as Linear Technologies (LLTC), Semtech Corp  (SMTC  -  Free Report), Intersil Corp (ISIL) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM  -  Free Report) will have mixed performances given their varied dependence on the auto market, they are, for the most part, highly diversified, high-margin businesses.Linear and Maxim have also reduced their dependence on the computing market, which we see as a positive in the near term. We believe these companies will generate moderate growth in 2012.WEAKNESSESWe believe that 2012 will be a transitional year, with inventory rebalancing and adjustment. Given the uncertainties in demand, we think that semiconductor manufacturers will curtail investment in capacity although technology purchases could continue. DRAM inventory remains in excess although NAND and NOR are slightly better off.In this environment, we would avoid investment in equipment companies, such as Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, etc. We particularly discourage investment in Applied Materials at this time because of its exposure to solar, where there is significant oversupply and resultant pricing pressure.The foundry segment will also have a moderate year (at best). The Thailand flooding and resultant weakness in the PC market and soft consumer spending increases risks in our opinion. We therefore continue to believe that investors should treat foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, United Microelectronics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International with caution.We also remain cautious about companies with relatively weak financials, such as Exar Corp (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite the relatively strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.

827,KLAC,"The year 2017 was a blockbuster year for investors as all the three major indices indicating the health of the U.S. market closed at record levels. An improved economic data for GDP, steady job additions, a favorable Consumer Confidence Index as well as factory activity data kept investors optimistic about the economy.The Tech sector was one of the largest beneficiaries of this rally, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) registering a return of 32.2% in the last year, on top of a 12.9% gain it registered in 2016.Tech Stocks Poised for Further GrowthThe technology sector is likely to grow further in 2018, as evident from the recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) on worldwide IT spending. The latest report from the independent research firm projects global IT spending to reach $3.7 trillion this year, representing an increase of 4.3% from $3.5 trillion projected in 2017.The sector will continue to benefit from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.However, in our opinion, the major push will come from the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax bill as it will bring double benefit for tech companies. Firstly, it will lift corporate earnings and secondly, as companies across other sectors might utilize savings from lower tax as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation this will again be conducive for the tech stocks.Naturally, investing in the tech space makes perfect sense at this point.Where to Put Your Money?Today, we’ve zeroed-in on some tech stocks using our premium screen “VGM Style Score” which had performed phenomenally last year and have the potential to carry the momentum this year as well.Our first choice is the world’s leading memory chip maker — Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM and NAND chips. This is primarily due to imbalances between industry demand and supply, which are leading to periodic shortage and temporary price hike. We believe Micron will continue its outperformance as long as demand for memory chips remains ahead of supply.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Micron is anticipated to finish fiscal 2018 with EPS growth of 102.2% and sales growth of 36.9%. Micron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock and has a VGM Score of A. Last year, the stock rallied 87.5%.

"
830,KLAC,"The industry has come a long way since the last downturn, with most of the players streamlining operations and transferring more routine production to low-cost locations. This has led to the development of the Asian market, where most memory production and backend operations have shifted. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) accounted for 53% of total semiconductor sales in September this year. Japan produced another 17%, followed by the Americas and Europe with 17% and 13%, respectively.
"
831,KLAC,"The computing market is not the only driver of semiconductor sales any more. Not only has the market matured, but it has also been severely impacted by the recession. Enterprise spending on computing has dropped, and higher levels of commoditization and corresponding pricing pressures have made it a lower-margin business. As a result, a number of chip companies have shifted focus to other areas.
"
832,KLAC,"The consumer electronics market is growing in importance, especially gadgets such as LCD TVs, blu-ray players, smartphones and netbooks. The problem with this segment being the major driver is its inherently low margins. Competition is fierce and aggressive pricing is the rule of the day. Therefore, although the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) expects shipments of LCD displays, blu-ray players and netbooks to increase 24%, 112% and 85%, respectively in 2009, it expects industry-wide revenue to be down 7.7%.
"
833,KLAC,"Smartphones are expected to be the exception, with revenue growing around 3% this year. Since semiconductors made for consumer goods are in the nature of components, there is ever-increasing pressure on their prices that correspondingly squeeze margins.
"
834,KLAC,"Communications infrastructure spending is currently being driven by China, although there are some signs of improvement in the domestic market. Medical Devices is an upcoming area and some IC makers have started developing products targeted at this market as well.
"
835,KLAC,"According to Autodata Corporation (as quoted by the CEA), vehicle sales have declined 40% from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009. The decline was driven by the recession and the industry's dependence on the lending environment.
"
836,KLAC,"However, there are a number of positives for semiconductor manufacturers serving this market. The most important is the growing electronic content per vehicle, driven by the need for fuel efficiency, entertainment and automated navigation. The fact that an automobile has a significantly longer life than a consumer device is an added bonus, as once a semiconductor has been designed in, it continues to generate revenue for a number of years. This leads to a stable business model.
"
837,KLAC,"The aerospace and defense markets are dependent on government spending and policy making. Currently, government spending is targeted at terrorist activity, so spending on intelligence systems and less sophisticated weaponry remains strong. Companies offering sophisticated weapons are not doing as well. Commercial aerospace remains affected by tight lending conditions. So semiconductor manufacturers serving these markets are seeing mixed results, depending on the customers served.
"
838,KLAC,"Given the end markets driving the current strength in the industry, we tend to think that manufacturers of DRAM and flash (both NAND and NOR) will continue to see strong demand. The transition from DDR2 to DDR3 will add to growth in this segment.
"
839,KLAC,"The demand for greater functionality in smaller and more power efficient gadgets is leading to greater integration within the semiconductor device. This is leading to increased demand for the system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is a single device incorporating a microprocessor, digital signal processor or graphics core, as well as memory and logic. Within SoCs, both application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products are expected to do well. ASICs are usually customized for a single buyer, while ASSPs may have multiple buyers.
"
840,KLAC,"The major players in the industry may be categorized into chipmakers, equipment and material suppliers, and foundries.
"
841,KLAC,"According to Gartner Dataquest and iSuppli Corp, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Toshiba Corp. were the top three semiconductor suppliers in 2008. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) dropped to the fourth position, as the company decided to phase off its wireless baseband business. STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report) was in fifth, followed by Japan's Renesas. Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Hynix stepped into the top ten for the first time, filling the next three positions. Infineon stayed at number 10.

843,KLAC,"All of the top five foundries are located in Asia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) and United Microelectronics Corp  , the two largest players in 2008, are located in Taiwan. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CHRT) is located in Singapore, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  is in China and Vanguard is also in Taiwan.OPPORTUNITIES
"
844,KLAC,"Manufacturing digital ICs is expensive, as it requires state-of-the-art technology and processes. On the other hand, digital products are cheaper, so cost recovery is more difficult. This has led to specialization in the industry and a greater contribution from Asian companies.
"
845,KLAC,"We particularly like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report), the world's largest pureplay foundry, which has started seeing very strong demand from all served end markets. The company is a technology leader and management intends to maintain this lead through R&D investment in 28nm and 22nm process technologies. Higher utilization and cost controls are also driving margins.
"
846,KLAC,"U.S. production is more focused on the analog side, which is a market dependent on innovation. Consequently, these products generate higher margins. They are also more customized and have longer life cycles.
"
847,KLAC,"These advantages are not lost on U.S. players, so the number of companies entering the market is on the rise. Our favorites in this area include Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices (ADI), both of which are seeing strengthening demand.
"
848,KLAC,"Although other players, such as Semtech Corp (SMTC  -  Free Report), Intersil Corp (ISIL), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Linear Technology (LLTC) are also benefiting from stronger end demand and inventory builds at distributors, other factors makes us a bit cautious about these stocks. For example, Maxim changed its growth strategy last year, which continues to impact margins. Linear Technology also revamped its portfolio, increasing its focus on the auto market. Consequently, the company has been hard-hit by the tight lending conditions.
"
849,KLAC,"Microprocessors are a big market dominated by a few players. We are positive about Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) because of its market position, superior innovation, effective strategies and strong cash position. However, the company’s dependence on the PC market and recent negative publicity could impact stock prices in the near term.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), on the other hand, is low on cash and market position, although the company’s competitive products, the foundry spin-off and recent agreement with Intel indicate upside for the stock. It is hard to ignore ARM Holdings (ARMH) in this space, as the company’s power-efficient low-performance chips dominate the growing cell phone market.
"
850,KLAC,"We also like logic maker Xilinx (XLNX) for its product innovation and position in China.
"
851,KLAC,"WEAKNESSES 
"
852,KLAC,"The semiconductor companies we are concerned about include those with very weak financials, such as Exar Corp. (EXAR) and FormFactor (FORM). For instance, FORM continues to burn cash despite strong demand for its specialized probe cards. It also has significant customer and market concentration that increase execution risks.TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) has been severely impacted by the recession, and the slower recovery in the communications networking market is telling on results.SIA Forecast 2009-2011
"
853,KLAC,"The Semiconductor Industry Association expects 2009 sales of $219.7 billion, an 11.6% decline from 2008 levels. However, sales are expected to increase over the next two years, by 10.2% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011. The forecast for 2009 is better than before due to particular strength in PCs and cell phones, which make up 60% of total semiconductor demand.                    
"
854,KLAC,"KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock, reported solid financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of the year in late April. Consensus earnings estimates for both this year and next have risen over the past 60 days. On May 25, KLAC announced that it finalized its acquisition of Therma-Wave Corporation. The company is currently yielding 0.88%, with a five-year average dividend yield of 0.37%.
"
855,KLAC,"Full Analysis
"
856,KLAC,"KLA-Tencor Corporation is the world leader in yield management and process control solutions for semiconductor manufacturing and related industries. The company has sales and service offices around the world.
"
857,KLAC,"On Apr 26, KLAC reported third-quarter fiscal 2007 profits of 87 cents per share.

Revenues soared 37.8% to $716.2 million from $519.6 million in the prior-year period. 
"
858,KLAC,"CEO Rick Wallace stated, ""KLA-Tencor's solid financial performance this quarter reflects our focus on enabling our customers to meet their technical and economic challenges with our inspection and metrology solutions."" 
"

"
869,KLAC,"•    Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 11.1% below what those same 478 firms reported a year ago, 10.3% above what they earned in 2Q09
"
870,KLAC,"•    Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 10.9% year over year, up 3.4% from 2Q09
"
871,KLAC,"•    2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 falls to 3.00, down from 3.25 last week, still very high
"
872,KLAC,"•    2010 ratio at 1.98, down slightly from 2.09 last week
"
873,KLAC,"•    S&P500 expected to earn $574.1 billion in 2008, $707.3 billion in 2010
"
874,KLAC,"•    Bottom Up estimates: $62.57 for 2009, $77.11 for 2010
"
875,KLAC,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much of a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
876,KLAC,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With over 95% of reports in, there have been 363 which have exceeded expectations while only 69 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.26. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
877,KLAC,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.20%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
878,KLAC,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 213 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 265 which have fallen short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.80.
"
879,KLAC,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over year-earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 7.57. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.64. Energy’s surprise ratio is not quite as high, at 3.22, but the disparity to its growth ratio, at just 0.53, is extreme. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
880,KLAC,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 478 firms that have reported are 11.1% below year-ago levels. A total of 267 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 185 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.44.
"
881,KLAC,"On the other hand, only 143 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 335 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.43. Put another way, only 29.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
882,KLAC,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprise. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
883,KLAC,"The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity. There is higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.
"
884,KLAC,"The strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected, and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with four sectors seeing more than six increases for each cut.
"
885,KLAC,"No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole, the revisions ratio now stands at 3.00, which while slightly lower than a few weeks ago, is still very high and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 1.98 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
893,KLAC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 0.80
"
894,KLAC,"•    Massive positive surprises in cyclical Construction, Industrial and Discretionary sectors 
"
895,KLAC,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
896,KLAC,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.  Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Industrial Products -25.90% 90.91% 13.92 19 1 9 11Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Construction 76.05% 100.00% 11.85 6 4 5 6Consumer Staples 1.65% 86.36% 11.85 35 3 26 12Business Service 6.73% 88.89% 11.81 7 0 2 6Computer and Tech -11.58% 92.77% 7.69 53 7 30 47Basic Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.74 14 4 4 16Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Medical 3.32% 95.45% 5.86 35 1 33 9Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.64 27 8 23 14Retail/Wholesale 2.62% 93.33% 5.41 34 5 24 18Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Oils and Energy -62.76% 97.56% 5.20 29 9 2 38Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Auto 183.55% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4S&P -11.05% 95.60% 7.20 363 69 213 265Sales Surprises

"
935,KLAC,"Analysts are responding to better-than-expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board. Unlike the data presented above for the surprises, the revisions data is for all 500 firms in the index. Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next week or two, but we are getting towards peak activity..
"
936,KLAC,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
937,KLAC,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 8.55, so it’s not just the cyclicals. Then again, given the great performance by the Staples on the surprise front, a strong estimate revisions performance is not surprising.
"
938,KLAC,"One industry that has seen some remarkable increases in their estimates for both this year and next is the Semiconductor Equipment industry, with firms like Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) and Novellus (NVLS) all seeing no estimates cut and double-digit numbers of increases leading to very large percentage gains in their mean estimates. Those are what one might term new economy cyclicals. Many of the old economy cyclicals like Ford (F  -  Free Report) and Cummins Engine (CMI  -  Free Report) have also seen large estimate increases.The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009 Sector  %ChCurrFiscalYrEst - 4wks  #FirmsUp #FirmsDown #EstsUp #EstsDown RevisionsRatio  Firmsup/downBusiness Service 3.42 8 0 66  4  16.50  NMConglomerates 1.8 7 1 66  5  13.20  7.00 Retail/Wholesale 3.4 32 9 405  51  7.94  3.56 Consumer Staples 2.07 30 7 218  33  6.61  4.29 Computer and Tech 5.15 62 15 620  141  4.40  4.13 Consumer Discretionary 5.12 24 5 207  64  3.23  4.80 Industrial Products 12.27 16 6 116  38  3.05  2.67 Medical 3.39 31 11 347  117  2.97  2.82 Basic Materials 3.65 14 6 120  41  2.93  2.33 Auto 15.48 5 1 30  11  2.73  5.00 Aerospace -0.74 6 4 88  35  2.51  1.50 Finance 3.86 54 23 530  235  2.26  2.35 Oils and Energy 1.32 27 14 291  180  1.62  1.93 Utilities 1.34 24 14 98  67  1.46  1.71 Construction 2.85 5 4 39  32  1.22  1.25 Transportation 0.02 5 4 50  43  1.16  1.25 S&P 3.47 350 124 3291 1097 3.00  2.82 Revisions: EarningsThe Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2010

"
957,KLAC,"•    Median Earnings Surprise 7.20%, very strong
"

"
959,KLAC,"•    Sales Surprise Ratio at 1.44
"
960,KLAC,"•    Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.43
"
961,KLAC,"•    Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 11.1% below what those same 478 firms reported a year ago, 10.3% above what they earned in 2Q09
"
962,KLAC,"•    Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 10.9% year over year, up 3.4% from 2Q09
"
963,KLAC,"•    2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 falls to 3.00, down from 3.25 last week, still very high
"
964,KLAC,"•    2010 ratio at 1.98, down slightly from 2.09 last week
"
965,KLAC,"•    S&P500 expected to earn $574.1 billion in 2008, $707.3 billion in 2010
"
966,KLAC,"•    Bottom Up estimates: $62.57 for 2009, $77.11 for 2010
"
967,KLAC,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much of a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
968,KLAC,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With over 95% of reports in, there have been 363 which have exceeded expectations while only 69 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.26. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
969,KLAC,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.20%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
970,KLAC,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 213 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 265 which have fallen short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.80.
"
971,KLAC,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over year-earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 7.57. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.64. Energy’s surprise ratio is not quite as high, at 3.22, but the disparity to its growth ratio, at just 0.53, is extreme. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
972,KLAC,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 478 firms that have reported are 11.1% below year-ago levels. A total of 267 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 185 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.44.
"
973,KLAC,"On the other hand, only 143 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 335 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.43. Put another way, only 29.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
974,KLAC,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprise. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
975,KLAC,"The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity. There is higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.
"
976,KLAC,"The strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected, and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with four sectors seeing more than six increases for each cut.
"
977,KLAC,"No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole, the revisions ratio now stands at 3.00, which while slightly lower than a few weeks ago, is still very high and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 1.98 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
986,KLAC,"•    Massive positive surprises in cyclical Construction, Industrial and Discretionary sectors 
"
987,KLAC,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
988,KLAC,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.  Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Industrial Products -25.90% 90.91% 13.92 19 1 9 11Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Construction 76.05% 100.00% 11.85 6 4 5 6Consumer Staples 1.65% 86.36% 11.85 35 3 26 12Business Service 6.73% 88.89% 11.81 7 0 2 6Computer and Tech -11.58% 92.77% 7.69 53 7 30 47Basic Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.74 14 4 4 16Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Medical 3.32% 95.45% 5.86 35 1 33 9Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.64 27 8 23 14Retail/Wholesale 2.62% 93.33% 5.41 34 5 24 18Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Oils and Energy -62.76% 97.56% 5.20 29 9 2 38Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Auto 183.55% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4S&P -11.05% 95.60% 7.20 363 69 213 265Sales Surprises

"
1021,KLAC,"•    Industrials, Autos seeing very large estimate increases
"
1022,KLAC,"•    Business Service and Conglomerates lead; Retail, Staples and Tech also strong
"
1023,KLAC,"•    Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates falls to 2.82 from 3.18 
"

"
1026,KLAC,"•    Total Revisions activity past peak for this earnings season, will fall sharply over next few weeks
"
1027,KLAC,"Analysts are responding to better-than-expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board. Unlike the data presented above for the surprises, the revisions data is for all 500 firms in the index. Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next week or two, but we are getting towards peak activity..
"
1028,KLAC,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
1029,KLAC,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 8.55, so it’s not just the cyclicals. Then again, given the great performance by the Staples on the surprise front, a strong estimate revisions performance is not surprising.
"
1030,KLAC,"One industry that has seen some remarkable increases in their estimates for both this year and next is the Semiconductor Equipment industry, with firms like Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report) and Novellus (NVLS) all seeing no estimates cut and double-digit numbers of increases leading to very large percentage gains in their mean estimates. Those are what one might term new economy cyclicals. Many of the old economy cyclicals like Ford (F  -  Free Report) and Cummins Engine (CMI  -  Free Report) have also seen large estimate increases.The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009 Sector  %ChCurrFiscalYrEst - 4wks  #FirmsUp #FirmsDown #EstsUp #EstsDown RevisionsRatio  Firmsup/downBusiness Service 3.42 8 0 66  4  16.50  NMConglomerates 1.8 7 1 66  5  13.20  7.00 Retail/Wholesale 3.4 32 9 405  51  7.94  3.56 Consumer Staples 2.07 30 7 218  33  6.61  4.29 Computer and Tech 5.15 62 15 620  141  4.40  4.13 Consumer Discretionary 5.12 24 5 207  64  3.23  4.80 Industrial Products 12.27 16 6 116  38  3.05  2.67 Medical 3.39 31 11 347  117  2.97  2.82 Basic Materials 3.65 14 6 120  41  2.93  2.33 Auto 15.48 5 1 30  11  2.73  5.00 Aerospace -0.74 6 4 88  35  2.51  1.50 Finance 3.86 54 23 530  235  2.26  2.35 Oils and Energy 1.32 27 14 291  180  1.62  1.93 Utilities 1.34 24 14 98  67  1.46  1.71 Construction 2.85 5 4 39  32  1.22  1.25 Transportation 0.02 5 4 50  43  1.16  1.25 S&P 3.47 350 124 3291 1097 3.00  2.82 Revisions: EarningsThe Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2010
