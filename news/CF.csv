8,CF,"The FDA on Thursday afternoon approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) potential blockbuster cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi, which the company priced at $259,000 per year, on the high side of investors' expectations.
"
9,CF,"The agency gave the nod to Orkambi, a combination of ivacaftor (which Vertex markets separately as Kalydeco) and lumacaftor, a booster that makes the drug effective in treating a much larger population than ivacaftor alone.
"
10,CF,"The FDA approved the product for patients whose condition is caused by two copies of the F508del mutation (homozygous), who account for about half of the 30,000 CF patients in the U.S.
"
11,CF,"However, the improvement that Orkambi yielded in clinical trials was smaller than Kalydeco's, which led to a widespread expectation that Vertex would price Orkambi lower than Kalydeco's $312,000-a-year mark. A buyside investor survey conducted by Evercore ISI on Monday found that the mean expected price was $235,000 while the median was $250,000, so the eventual $259,000 price was a bit on the high side.
"
12,CF,"Company Chief Financial Officer Ian Smith, however, hints that the discount rate for Orkambi might be higher than for Kalydeco. After discounts, Kalydeco costs an average of $220,000 a year.
"
13,CF,"In a conference call with analysts, Smith noted that an estimated 35% to 40% of homozygous F508del patients are on Medicaid, a higher percentage than the group taking Kalydeco, suggesting the population is poorer.
"
14,CF,"Vertex has an assistance program in place, called Vertex GPS, to help ensure that patients will be able to afford this pricey medicine; Chief Commercial Officer Stuart Arbuckle says that most Kalydeco patients pay less than $50 a month out of pocket, and Vertex plans to continue the strategy with Orkambi.
"
15,CF,"Arbuckle says that the lift-off for Orkambi will likely be slower than it was with Kalydeco.
"
16,CF,"""The uptake with Kalydeco was as fast as any product I've personally been involved in — we got to about 90% of eligible patients in about nine months,"" Arbuckle said. ""With Orkambi, while we expect to get very, very strong demand from both physicians and patients, just the sheer volume of patients leads us to believe that the time to peak is going to be longer.""
"
17,CF,"Arbuckle notes that while each of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. averaged only three or four patients eligible for Kalydeco, they will have 30 apiece hoping for Orkambi.

18,CF,"Trading on Vertex stock was halted just before noon ET as the news broke, after the stock rose nearly 4% in morning trading. When it resumed trading at 3 p.m. ET, Vertex stock was up 4%, above 131. The stock touched a record high of 137.50 on April 23.

35,CF,"ETF investors in biotechnology stocks may be rattled by the nose-dive of the first heavyweight out of the earnings gate. IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), the $10 billion biotech exchange traded fund, has lost 0.8% in the past three trading sessions as Illumina (ILMN) stumbled. Ahead of Celgene's  (CELG) and Biogen's  (BIIB) reports this week, IBD spoke to Tushar…
"
36,CF,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion. The stock hit a new 14-year high of 70.42 Wednesday before closing down more than 1%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

57,CF,"An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted 12-1 in favor of approving Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi Tuesday afternoon. The FDA has until July 5 to decide on approval, but it usually follows the recommendations of its panels.So much buzz surrounded the event that trading in Vertex stock was halted all day Tuesday while the panel debated the issues. Orkambi is a combination of Vertex's drug Kalydeco, which has already proven a hit treating patients with the rare G551D mutation, and lumacaftor, a product that can potentially expand it to use in the more common F508del mutation. Analysts predict multibillion-dollar sales eventually.Though the panel was generally expected to vote yes, the FDA's briefing documents, released Friday, raised some serious issues with the data. The benefit of the treatment was statistically significant but small. The patient pool involved was also not large, creating a real possibility that the panel would want Vertex to gather more data.The next question after approval, say analysts, is where Vertex is going to price the combo. Its pricing of Kalydeco at $300,000 a year was controversial but not completely out of line for drugs with small patient pools and rare yet serious diseases that payers are normally willing to shell out for. Some of the issues raised in the panel discussion, however, may come back to haunt Vertex, says Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, especially in single-payer Europe.""We believe the risk of regulatory non-approval is still low (NOT ZERO!), but that we should all bear in mind that some of the questions raised in the document could make reimbursement discussions outside the U.S. more difficult,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email Friday.Vertex has been unprofitable the last two years, but the Orkambi launch is expected to right the ship, bringing a profit of $3.77 a share next year, according to analysts' estimates. The stock has a steep IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93 and a market cap north of $30 billion.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

59,CF,"Shares of big-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals fell Monday after the results on its latest cystic fibrosis drug disappointed investors. Vertex (VRTX) reported data from a mid stage study combining drug candidate VX-661 with the al ready-marketed ivacaftor, branded Kalydeco, in patients with cystic fibrosis caused by homozygous F508del mutation. Vertex's other products already treat this population, but the firm hopes VX-661 can be expanded into the harder-to-treat heterozygous F508del mutation population.

69,CF,"Stocks for a number of fertilizer makers, led by Calgary, Alberta-based Agrium (AGU) are climbing as companies raise dividends and see analysts ratchet up earnings projections for 2015.Agrium announced Jan. 22 it had raised its dividend payout ratio to 40% to 50% of free cash flow. That was up from its prior target of 25% to 35%. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. (POT) cranked up its dividend to 38 cents per share from 35.The fertilizer industry is easy to underestimate. In reality, the trade has a bewildering number of moving parts. They start with operations to mine inputs including phosphate rock and potash, and others to refine ammonium nitrate. The supply/demand scenario of each of those strongly affects profit. So do fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Weather, and the balance of plantings between corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops — both in the U.S. and overseas — drive demand on an annual basis. And massive supply contracts, such as the one inked Jan. 22 by Canpotex — a consortium owned by Potash Corp., Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium — provide significant visibility into exports to China and India's massive fertilizer markets.Fertilizer stocks have been reeling since a potash price crash in 2013. A Jan. 15 Goldman Sachs note maintained ""a bearish view on potash pricing"" for 2015, partly due to oncoming Canadian production capacity and to the end of sanctions vs. potash-rich Belarus in December. U.S. nitrogen margins ""remain resilient,"" the note said, supported by ongoing weak natural gas prices.But the note upgraded Deerfield, Ill.-based CF Industries (CF) to buy from hold, noting prospects for a doubling of its dividend (currently $1.50 quarterly) within two years. The stock has been trading tightly and notching new highs after clearing a three-month consolidation in January.Agrium cleared an eight-week cup base on Jan. 22 with a 5% spike in heavy trade. The stock is ticking off new highs, trading 4% above the 104.03 buy point on Tuesday as it works to climb out of a two-year hole. Agrium reports its Q4 results Feb. 24.Mosaic has been climbing from an October low, decisively retaking 10- and 40-week support in the past four weeks. The stock cleared a 48.83 handle buy point Jan. 30. It remains just below an alternative buy point of 51.35. Mosaic reports its fourth-quarter results Feb. 11.

79,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals sailed through one of the most crucial tests in its 25-year existence when its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment hit goals in a late-stage study. Upon disclosure Tuesday, Vertex stock soared to a 14-year high, closing up 40.4% to 93.53.
"
80,CF,"Vertex (VRTX) pooled results from two phase three clinical trials looking at patients with a homozygous pair of genes with the F508del genetic mutation, the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. Patients taking a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for 24 weeks showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function as well as a significant reduction in the rates of pulmonary exacerbations and improvements in body mass.
"
81,CF,"""These pivotal results validate our strategy of using a combination of a corrector, lumacaftor, and a potentiator, ivacaftor, to treat the underlying cause of CF,"" Vertex CEO Jeffrey Leiden told analysts Tuesday.

"
83,CF,"Wall Street Hesitated
"
84,CF,"The size of the stock move reflects how uncertain Wall Street was that the treatment would work, as well as how significant the news is for Vertex. In 2011, Vertex enjoyed what was, at the time, the biggest drug launch in history with its hepatitis C treatment Incivek. But a year later, sales fell sharply as competition came online, especially Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi, which has already surpassed Incivek's launch record since it was approved in December.
"
85,CF,"In 2012 ivacaftor, one of the two drugs in the latest study, was approved for sale as Kalydeco. But it was approved only for patients with the G551D mutation. They represent only 4% of CF sufferers in the U.S., according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
"
86,CF,"Thanks partly to controversially aggressive pricing — around $300,000 a year — Vertex still has been able to pull hundreds of millions in annual revenue off a patient base of just a few thousand. But being able to treat the 50,000 or so patients with the F508del mutation, whether homozygous or heterozygous, would turn ivacaftor into a blockbuster.

88,CF,"On Tuesday, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that while the results were ""not a home run"" due to the modest rate of lung-function improvement (the mean improvement was 2.6% to 4%), the lack of better alternatives means that peak annual sales could hit $3 billion.

90,CF,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that Vertex is also testing a third drug, VX-661, and has a whole library of other correctors that could work in a wider range of genetic types. He estimates peak annual sales of $4.5 billion for the whole CF franchise.

The action yields a 178.35 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis. Shares soared 15% on June 29 when competitor Galapagos (GLPG) released weak test results on its own cystic fibrosis drug.The biotech company develops three cystic fibrosis drugs: Orkambi, Kalydeco and Symdeko.In the most recent quarter, earnings growth measured 85%, but revenue declined 10% vs. the year-ago period due to significantly lower collaborative revenue.

115,CF,"Dividend stocks come in all shapes and sizes. And seasons.The name CF Industries (CF) recently cropped up on IBD's Dividend Leaders list, just as Corn Belt farmers should be rolling into their spring planting season. This year's weather has been uncooperative, however, keeping farmers from their fields by spreading snow, rain and heavy winds from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest.Still, analyst consensus projects the equivalent of a 476% rebound in CF's EPS to 94 cents a share this year, followed by an 85% gain in 2019 to $1.74. CF lost 25 cents a share in 2017. The Deerfield, Ill., company exited nine quarters of earnings declines in the fourth quarter. Its Q1 EPS is forecast to rise 400%.The stock's chart is not pretty. Its price has slipped 9% since the start of the year. Shares are just climbing off support at their 40-week moving average. They could be building a base, but have got a ways to go. And the stock's dragging relative strength line is not what you want to see, even from dividend stocks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd yet CF may be worth putting on your radar. Some analysts project that the entire fertilizer industry is set for a cyclical upturn. Two of the industry's largest names, Potash Saskatchewan and Agrium, combined in January to form Nutrien (NTR). The merger tightened competition and provided the industry added control over manufacturing and supply. Consensus estimates expect Nutrien's earnings to soar 420% this year and 27% in 2019.Susquehanna Financial group trimmed its earnings outlook for CF Industries in late March, as bad weather pointed to delays in purchases of nitrogen fertilizer. Susquehanna also dropped the stock's 12-month price target to 50 from 54. The target is still more than 30% above where the stock traded on Monday.CF currently pays a 30-cent quarterly dividend per share, so the stock yields 3.1% annually. The company paid down $1.1 billion of high-interest debt at the end of 2017. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group project the company will pay down an additional $500 million in debt this year.Next to flashy tech and big defense names, fertilizers seem like a sleepy little sideline industry. But the stocks wowed investors with a collective run-up of more than 1,100% from 2002 to 2008. The group crashed along with the market, then ran up an additional 316% from 2008 to 2013.The Potash/Agrium merger left CF, Mosaic (MOS) and Nutrien as the leading publicly traded players in a vast and vitally important industry. Only CF and Nutrien are dividend stocks. But all of the stocks in the group vary according to several factors. One is the price of corn and soybeans. Two of the most widely planted North American crops, they also require the most intensive use of fertilizers.But the trade tiff between the U.S. and China have left corn prices uncertain, to say the least. Prices on Monday were up 8%. That sounds OK, but it is also 11% below corn's high from last July.Another factor: crude oil prices. The use of corn-based ethanol as an extender for U.S. gasoline supplies has kept corn and oil prices fairly closely related. It has also typically made fertilizer stocks an aggressive way to tap oil price gains.Between August 2006 and June 2008, for example, the stocks in IBD's Chemicals-Agricultural industry group staged a massive 453% rally. That corresponded precisely to a 155% run-up in U.S. oil prices during that same period.In addition, other factors amplified the 2008 fertilizer rally. For one, phosphorus rock was in comparatively short supply. Today, the links between fertilizer stocks and oil prices are somewhat weakened.As a group, fertilizer stocks on Monday traded up 24% from a June 2017 low. Crude oil prices climbed 60% during that same period.At the same time, the price of natural gas fell 10%. And nitrogen production capacity is now in relatively tight supply. Analysts project that this combination of tight supply, low raw-material costs and recovering demand is ultimately going to play in strong favor of the big fertilizer names.Susquehanna's March 28 note said the analysts remained ""positive on the nitrogen cycle."" The analysts continue to expect a multiyear up cycle ""due to lagging global capacity growth that should be outpaced by even modest demand growth.""CF's five-year dividend growth rate is 31%, although it has not raised its payout since August 2014.RELATED:Why You Want To Pay Attention To These Earnings Reports Oracle Chief Tells Trump Pentagon Cloud Plan Makes 'No Sense' Apple, Intel Lead Five Tech Titans That Just Carved This Bullish Pattern

117,CF,"For swing traders, losses can be like clouds. If you have too many and they are too large, they can overshadow a once bright portfolio. We can't control the weather but we can control our losses by using trading rules.X  So far this year, IBD's SwingTrader has seen mostly sunny days. The win rate stands at 62%, largely because we avoided the 11.7% correction in the Nasdaq composite by going to cash on Feb. 1. We've been taking modest gains averaging over 6% quickly, with the average trade length coming in at seven trading days. We did let one stock, Fibria Celulose (FBR), rally 20% above our entry price before removing it. Our net gain was closer to 15%, since we took half profits on the way up. That stock was also the longest held at 15 trading days.But just as important as piling up winners, we've kept the average losers to just 2%. Keeping losses small is what lets big winners like Fibria shine. That's why we always have a stop loss set from the start and we employ flexibility to take a loss earlier if warranted.Take CF Industries (CF), a recent loss on SwingTrader. The stock had a number of things going for it when we added it March 5. It broke out of what looked like a downward sloping handle, volume was the heaviest in six months and the Relative Strength line hit new high ground (1). The market also was following through on a bullish reversal, and the industry group was showing strength as it broke out.Despite all the things going for it, the next day showed a worrisome character change (2). Our gain of 2.5% vanished even though the market was forging ahead. We were still well above our stop loss with volume lighter than the massive volume on the breakout. But the negative action deserved a response. We took half the position off for a small loss.The next day, CF Industries gapped down at the open. After giving it a few minutes to stabilize, we exited the remaining position at our stop loss price of 42.49 (3). Rather than taking a 3.1% hit on the trade, the earlier removal of a half position shaved the loss to 2.3%. As the next two trading days unfolded, the stock dropped another 7.5% from our average exit price (4). Letting a loss get that large can seriously damage a portfolio. Employing rules to avoid big losses keeps the sun shining on your portfolio.More details on past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Aligning The Stars To Increase Profit Potential In Swing TradesSell Rules Put Swing Trader Into Cash Before Stock Market CorrectionDon't Fear The Reaper With Stock LossesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

120,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares rocketed to a three-month high Friday after rival Galapagos (GLPG) released disappointing results for a cystic fibrosis treatment that led partner AbbVie (ABBV) to opt out of additional studies.On the stock market today, Vertex popped 15.2%, to 169.96. Shares of Galapagos tumbled 3.8%, to 92.18, though AbbVie stock lifted 0.3%, to 92.69.

The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance.

121,CF,"Stocks dug into substantial early losses early Tuesday, as an intensifying U.S.-China trade spat triggered a deep sell-off across Asian stock markets. China trade-sensitive stocks, including Boeing (BA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), posted heavy declines on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.A broad range of China stocks spearheaded the early losses. JD.com (JD), Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU), Huya (HUYA) and JinkoSolar (JKS) were among the deepest decliners.The Dow Jones industrial avereage came off opening lows, but was down 1.2% shortly after the start of trade. Boeing and Caterpillar (CAT) led the downside. More than half of the Dow's 30 issues fell more than 1%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each shed 0.7%. About a dozen S&P 500 names sold down more than 2%. China trade sensitive names CF Industries (CF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and General Motors (GM) fell furthest.China names were among the Nasdaq's worst decliners. JD.com, NetEase and Baidu had three of the Nasdaq 100's four worst losses.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors continued to ping-pong on U.S.-China news, as the Senate passed a bill Monday that would reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been attempting to acquire the NXP in a $43 billion deal which China's regulators reportedly approved last week. But the approval had been hitched to President Trump's forgiving ZTE for its violations of trade sanctions vs. North Korea. On Tuesday, NXP dropped 1.8% to one of the Nasdaq 100's deepest early losses. Qualcomm was down 1.6%.The Dow has five straight declines under its belt, falling back below the 25,000 level on Monday. The index appears headed for a break of its 50-day line at Tuesday's open, although premarket action does not always follow through into regular trade.  The S&P 500 ended Monday 3% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq remains just a fraction off Thursday's high, and 5% above its 50-day level.With 25% tariffs on $50 billion on imports from China set to kick in on July 6, China has said it would impose equal penalties on U.S. imports. If those tariffs go into place, President Trump on Monday said he would increase the scope of U.S. tariffs to $200 billion worth of China goods.As a result, Asian stock markets careened lower Tuesday. The yuan dropped to a five-month low against the dollar and investors scrambled to get out of the way of the worsening trade dispute. The Shanghai Composite swooned 3.8%, the Shenzhen Composite dived 5.3% as more than 1,000 stocks hit their daily 10% loss maximum circuit breaker. The selling quickly infected Japan's market, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plummeted 1.8%, cutting below its 50-day moving average.Asia's rout moderated somewhat in Europe, where markets traded sharply lower in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX fell hardest, down 1.3%. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.2% in the red, while London's FTSE 100 dimmed 0.5%.Sellers went after a number of China-based stocks in early U.S. trade. JinkoSolar dropped more than 4%. JD.com, Ctrip and Weibo (WB) all showed losses deeper than 3%.  Among the scorching-hot trio of China IPOs: Huya, iQiyi (IQ) and Bilibili (BILI), gtwo reversed premarket losses and punched higher: Huya gained a fraction. IQiyi scored a 3% gain. All three stocks are due for price consolidation, and pullbacks could present investors with buy opportunities.Another China-based IPO, Sogou (SOGO), broke out on Friday, then retook its cup-base buy point Monday in a huge-volume gain. Shares dropped 3.8% before Tuesday's open, holding just above the base's 14.80 buy point.China names also led the early declines among IBD 50 stocks. China Lodging (HTHT) dropped 3.6%. YY (YY) fell 1.9%. Momo (MOMO) dumped 3.7%. The declines did not do significant damage to the charts of either China Lodging or Momo.The loss dealt a setback to YY, which has been struggling to build the right side of a three-month base pattern.On the Dow, Boeing unraveled 3.2%, cutting below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade. The stock is trading below a 365.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A fall below 335.89 would trigger the automatic sell rule.Verizon (VZ) scored one of the Dow's lonely early gains, rising 1%. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy, from hold. Verizon has been attempting to start up the right side of a four-month base pattern.China-based Autohome (ATHM) notched the deepest early loss among IBD Leaderboard names.

131,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) beat fourth-quarter sales expectations by more than 9% and has selected a pair of cystic fibrosis treatments to send into late-stage testing, the company said late Wednesday.X Vertex reported adjusted income of 61 cents per share on $651.6 million in sales, rising a respective 74% and 42% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 58 cents a share on $596 million in sales.Of its total sales, Vertex brought in $621 million in revenue from cystic fibrosis treatments, growing 37% year over year. Its biggest drug, Orkambi, increased 32% to $365 million and Kalydeco, also known as ivacaftor, tacked on 44% growth to $256 million.Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden called 2017 ""an outstanding year for Vertex,"" in a written statement.""As we look at 2018 and beyond, Vertex's scientific expertise and financial strength position us to advance key pipeline programs in CF, including our triple combination regimens and bring forth potential new medicines in multiple other serious diseases.""In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.2% after closing up 0.2%, to 166.87, during the regular session.The triple-pill treatments are expected to treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients, said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, Vertex's executive vice president and chief medical officer. Vertex plans to send combos using the drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 into late-stage testing this year.""We look forward to concluding our discussions with regulators and initiating Phase 3 development in the first half of the year, with the goal of bringing a triple regimen to patients as quickly as possible,"" Chodakewitz said in a written statement.Excitement has been building surrounding the potential triple-pill, which targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In total, Vertex had four potential combinations it was considering.Vertex has now narrowed that down to two potential combinations. A combination of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor will begin two Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2018. The two studies will investigate the regimen's effect in two patient groups with different genetic mutations.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis-focused company. In its earliest days, it was focused on hepatitis C until Gilead Sciences launched a massively successful drug called Sovaldi in 2011. How did Vertex escape that crisis? Head to The New America for more.Pending additional data in the first half of the year, Vertex also plans to send a combination of VX-445 with tezacaftor and a drug called VX-561 into Phase 3 testing as a once-daily treatment in two groups of patients with different genetic mutations.Vertex selected the treatments based on ongoing studies which show absolute improvements in patients' ability to forcefully expel air for one second. Those treated with VX-659 and VX-445 regimens showed improvements of 13.3 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively, through four weeks of treatment in some cystic fibrosis patients.The triple combinations were generally well tolerated across both studies, Vertex said, with the majority of adverse events mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low.Vertex isn't the only firm seeking to make a triple-regimen to treat cystic fibrosis. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) have also teamed up to make a triple-pill. But analysts have said the duo is several years behind. Most see Vertex's triple getting approval in the 2019-20 time frame.In February, Vertex expects to get approval in the U.S. for a regimen of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and older with a specific genetic mutation. European regulators will make their determination in the second half of 2018.Vertex said it will issue 2018 guidance for cystic fibrosis drug sales after the anticipated U.S. approval for the tezacaftor and ivacaftor regimen on Feb. 28. Analysts expect Vertex to offer an outlook of $2.89 a share in adjusted earnings on $2.73 billion in sales.Vertex is also planning to move forward with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) using gene therapy to treat blood diseases known as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Trials are expected to begin this year in Europe and the U.S.RELATED:Biotech With 210% Growth Testing Buy Zone, Gets New Drug ApprovalWhich Biotech Stocks Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?Why These 2 Biotechs Could Outperform Amid 'Hyper-Competition'

132,CF,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months.

135,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden calls 2017 a ""transformational year"" for the biotechnology company, which looks likely to end the year with about $2 billion on its balance sheet and a rapidly approaching approval for a key cystic fibrosis treatment.X The company's stock price reflects its successes in the year. Shares have almost doubled year to date, rising 96% to outperform Investor's Business Daily's 460-company Biotech industry group, which has climbed more than 24% since January.As the year began, Leiden told IBD he laid out a three-part strategy beginning in 2017. Among his goals: Expand the number of eligible patients for Vertex's cystic fibrosis, or CF drugs, expand the pipeline outside of the lung disease sector and strengthen its financial stance.Leiden says some of those goals came to fruition in 2017. He expects to continue on the same trajectory as Vertex sends potential triple-pill regimens to treat cystic fibrosis into pivotal trials next year and dives deeper into treating other diseases with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Moderna Therapeutics.""So, when you really look at where we started the year, approved for a bit less than half of all patients with (cystic fibrosis) and we ended the year with medicines we believe will be able to get us up to 90% of patients,"" he said. ""You know, that's a very significant expansion of the patient population we think we can treat.""Here's what Leiden had to say about Vertex's plans, examining the company's strategy for both inside and outside of cystic fibrosis medications:IBD: What major accomplishments did Vertex have in 2017?Leiden: In expanding medicines for cystic fibrosis, I'd say (we had) four very important accomplishments. One, the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration's) approval for Kalydeco (for patients with) residual function mutations (which had previously been declined by the FDA). So that's 1,500 more patients in the U.S. Very importantly, it was a breakthrough with respect to regulatory science. This was, I think, the first approval ever of a medicine for new patient populations based just on in-vitro data, cellular data. It's really a testament, I think, to us working with the FDA to get them to appreciate and trust the strength of our cell-based assay that can predict (effectiveness).In Europe, we successfully obtained reimbursement for Orkambi, in particular, but also Kalydeco in a number of countries, particularly Ireland and Italy, also the Netherlands. That expanded the number of patients who are now reimbursed for our medicines there.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex was near a crisis point in 2014 when it pulled a blockbuster hepatitis C drug from the market amid mounting competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD). See how the pivot to cystic fibrosis transformed the company by visiting The New America.The third one was obviously the positive Phase 3 data for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (to treat cystic fibrosis) and that data was highly positive in two different trials. We were able to very quickly submit regulatory applications for both to the FDA and the (European Medicines Agency). And we expect approval of that medicine in the first quarter of next year in the U.S. and in the first half of third quarter in Europe. And that's going to pick up a large number of patients who, today, are not taking a CFTR corrector (which targets certain gene mutations), particularly those patients who had difficulty tolerating Orkambi. So we're talking about thousands of additional patients that would be eligible for tezacaftor/ivacaftor next year.The final one and, in a way, the most important one for the long run was, we announced Phase 1 and Phase 2 data for three of our different triple-regimens, so called next-generation regimens. That data told us that we're going to be able to reach up to 90% of all patients with CF with a single triple-combination medicine. And the data was strong enough we're confident we'll be able to start the pivotal trials, the final trials, for those medicines in the first half of next year.Expanding the pipeline beyond CF is something we haven't talked about as much, yet. But you'll be hearing a lot more in 2018. These new programs are in very serious disorders like sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (an inherited disorder that may cause lung and liver ailments) and are moving forward really nicely, thankfully faster than we expected. We hope to get at least one and maybe two of those medicines in the clinic next year and we'll start to talk more about them. But they're medicines that are very much like our CF medicines. They treat the underlying cause of the disease, they're transformational and we're really excited we're able to move those forward because we ultimately want to be a serious diseases company, not just a CF company.In terms of the financial strength of the company, we will likely end the year with close to or more than $2 billion on our balance sheet based upon the increased number of patients we can treat with CF. And that's really important to us, not because we want to build a big balance sheet, but because it gives us the financial wherewithal to both invest in our internal research programs to make more new medicines, but also to go out and do some business development deals that will allow us to enhance our pipeline even further.IBD: What can we expect to see in 2018 from Vertex?Leiden: We look at the same goals: Expand access to CF medicines, develop the pipeline beyond CF and produce more financial strength. I think the things you should look for in 2018 from us are, first, the tezacaftor/ivacaftor approval in the U.S. and Europe. That's very, very important because that will allow those patients to get access to the medicine. Second, expanding access even further for Orkambi, particularly in Europe.There's a couple of countries where we're still negotiating: France and the U.K. And we want to try to finish those negotiations for reimbursement in Europe next year. The start of the pivotal trials for either one or two triple regimens in the first half of next year. That's a very important milestone for the company and for patients. And the final one is watching for those first programs to get into the clinic outside of CF. The two that seem to be furthest along now are in sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease.IBD: Can you make any predictions for the broader biotech group?Leiden: I think it's really the most exciting time in biotech in the 30 to 40 years I've been doing this. For two reasons. One, some of the new therapeutics technologies like gene editing, gene therapy that are really coming to maturity now, cell-based therapies. We're going to see all of those become viable therapies in the next five years and that's unbelievably exciting.We're seeing it already with immunotherapy with CAR-T cells, you'll see it soon with gene editing and gene therapies. So there are lots of new therapeutic modalities that allow us and others to attack diseases that were hard to attack. That's one side of the equation. The other side of the equation is we're just now getting a much better understanding of the biology in some of these diseases, meaning we're getting better at picking the targets.Most drug failures today are because you can't make a drug that targets your target; it's because you picked the wrong target. So the better we understand the biology — and we as an industry are understanding the biology much better — the higher probability of success. So I think when you take those two advances together, we're going to see a pretty significant kind of acceleration in breakthrough therapies.RELATED:Galapagos Pops To Vertex's Detriment — But Can It Compete?Vertex Pops As Analyst Questions Whether Rival Has 'Viable Drug'Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

137,CF,"Canada reportedly has ditched plans to buy new Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets after a trade spat over Bombardier's (BDRBF) C Series passenger jet.X Canada was expected to buy 18 new Super Hornets from Boeing, but sources told Reuters Tuesday that Ottawa will announce plans to buy used Australian F/A-18s next week instead, as the older planes are the same model that Canada currently has in its fleet.The decision comes after the U.S. Commerce Department levied a 300% tariff on each Bombardier C Series jet delivered to the U.S., following accusations from Boeing that the Canadian industrial giant was receiving unfair government subsidies.Boeing shares were down 0.9% on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Last year, Canada announced that it would buy the F/A-18 Super Hornets as a stopgap to replace its aging CF-18 fighters until it can hold a new competition for a replacement.Canada originally planned to buy 65 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s before opening up a new competition to upgrade its fighters.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow SpaceX Could Disrupt Boeing, Airbus And The Airline Industry

140,CF,"The allure of bitcoin was too much for CME Group (CME).The world's largest exchange owner reversed course today and said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, only a month after dismissing such a plan. The largest cryptocurrency, which has surged more than sixfold this year, climbed to a record high after the announcement.CME's neighbor across the street in Chicago seems to have had a lot to do with the decision. Cboe Global Markets said earlier this year that it was going to begin a bitcoin futures contract by year-end or early 2018, and awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CME contract will settle in cash and use a daily price from the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Missing from that list is Gemini, one of the other large global exchanges, which struck a deal with Cboe.A functioning derivatives market could help professional traders and investors access the incredible volatility inherent in bitcoin without having to trade on unfamiliar venues that may risk anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. It will also allow traders to hedge their cash positions in the digital currency, which to date has been difficult to do.""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities,"" Terrence Duffy, CME's chief executive officer, said in a statement today.The creation of bitcoin futures is a key step in opening the asset to institutional investors, who currently have few opportunities, said Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Bitcoin Investment Trust, currently one of the only avenues for investors seeking bitcoin-backed securities, is trading at a premium of more than 30 percent above net asset value. The trust, known as GBTC, is a ""physical"" fund, meaning it holds bitcoin itself.""The amount of institutional money in bitcoin now is very little because there are very few vehicles,"" Bogart said. ""If there are bitcoin futures, there can be futures-based"" exchange-traded funds.In the race for bitcoin derivatives, both CME and Cboe have lost to a startup. LedgerX won CFTC approval to offer swaps and options on bitcoin and began trading earlier this month. Volumes have been light so far. Yesterday, 103 bitcoin swaps traded on LedgerX, while nine options contracts changed hands, according to the exchange. The LedgerX options trades are physically-delivered, giving investors who hold a contract to maturity the ability to own bitcoin outright.Ari Paul, a co-founder of Blocktower Capital, said LedgerX is starting out slowly on purpose. ""DRW is a market maker there,"" Paul said. ""There's pretty low volume. A million dollars a day. I do expect them to have a lot of volume very soon. They are intelligently ramping up.""Many investors who want to can't maintain ownership of bitcoin now, what's known as custody, ""either for regulatory reasons or because it's scary and hard,"" Paul said. But in a regulated market like futures that doesn't become an issue. ""The ability to easily short allows for market neutral strategies and makes high-frequency trading much easier. That draws a lot of attention from hedge funds and the traditional finance world.""CME and Cboe face challenges to win over investors to their bitcoin futures. If the underlying pricing is unsound that could steer people aways, said Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University's Questrom School of Business.""The concern is that CME will attempt to treat bitcoin like a corn or wheat future when this commodity is in a highly risky class of its own,"" Williams said. ""One of the major spots to buy and sell bitcoin are through unregulated bucket shop exchanges located outside of the reach of U.S. regulators."" He noted that since 2009, almost half of these types of exchanges included Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin market, have gone bust. ""CME has no other commodity future that looks like or behaves like bitcoin. To me this means trouble.""Jon West, head trader at digital asset brokerage Omega One, said the amount of daily margin CME and Cboe require will be a key ingredient. If it's too high ""then it's not very useful for hedging because you need to have so much money in your account,"" he said. CME should take it slow as it designs its contract, he said. ""It's a very complex asset with a lot going on.""The creation of bitcoin futures should make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund based on the digital asset. Yet so far that's been a much harder task. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — the co-creators of the Gemini exchange — saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too difficult given that ""significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,"" according to the agency.CME is a giant in trading with products including futures on the S&P 500, oil and gold, and customer connections all around the world. The timing of the decision is a bit of a surprise. Just a month ago, CME President Bryan Durkin said on Bloomberg Television that ""I really don't see us going forward with a futures contract in the very near future.""Under Duffy's leadership it has pulled back from business interests that didn't align with its historic role as a futures powerhouse, such as shutting down its European operations and exiting credit-default swap clearing. Its resistance to bitcoin futures was seen as aligned with Duffy's vision of keeping the company's focus on what it has always done well.""I'm a little concerned about the fact that both of those futures contracts are cash settled,"" said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain, a sister company of trading firm DV Trading, which trades cryptocurrencies. The Cboe contract will be settled using auctions on the Gemini exchange. See said there has not been a lot of volume in those auctions, so he raised the question of what happens if an auction fails, or there's not enough volume to keep it from being manipulated.""I'm really excited to see derivatives come into the space,"" See said. ""I see it as a great step, but in an ideal world I'd really like to see physical delivery"" in futures.Another benefit is the increased regulation that will come with bitcoin futures, Omega One's West said. ""Futures trading should deter some black market business and push it into more regulated places,"" he said.

143,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock pulled back Friday, but an analyst upgraded shares on the likelihood Vertex will succeed against competitors like Galapagos (GLPG) in treating cystic fibrosis.Needham analyst Alan Carr upgraded Vertex stock to a buy rating, with a 155 price target, as the top-10 biotech by market cap works to complete a triple-pill combination to treat the genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis, a lung disease.The ""CF landscape continues to favor Vertex, given substantial lead in a market with few competitors,"" Carr wrote in a research report. He expects Vertex's triple-pill combination for cystic fibrosis to launch in late 2020.But Vertex stock fell 1.5% to 133.50 on the stock market today as some biotechs took a breather after a rapid 5-day run-up.Carr expects Vertex to identify at least one safe and effective triple-pill for cystic fibrosis. The company is currently testing four candidates in combination with its drugs known as ivacaftor and tezacaftor.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were on a run this week as generalist investors returned to the space amid subsiding worries that Trump would work to bring down drug prices. A number of companies saw double-digit and high-single-digit gains. For the rundown, visit IBD Industry Themes.Other programs are underway at Galapagos/AbbVie (ABBV), ProQR (PRQR) and Proteostasis Therapeutics, but patient recruitment in cystic fibrosis is a challenge, Carr said. Given Vertex's lead, competitors are likely to progress slowly, he said.Earlier this week, Galapagos said it's holding off trials of its own triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis until the fourth quarter. This puts Galapagos more than a year behind Vertex, a Janney analyst said Wednesday.RELATED:Galapagos Stock Under Fire After Delaying Key Vertex-Rivaling DrugWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideBiotechs Hit Pause On 5-Day Rally As Regeneron, Bluebird Topple

144,CF,"Biotech Galapagos (GLPG) has a shot at making a dent in the cystic fibrosis market, but it will lag Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), analysts said Wednesday after Galapagos pushed out a key trial.Analysts heading into Galapagos' research and development event Tuesday expected the firm to outline its timeline for a trial examining a three-pill series to treat cystic fibrosis, Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said in a note to clients.Instead, Galapagos is holding off its trials until the fourth quarter, pending regulatory guidance, Chattopadhyay said. Its closest rival, Vertex, plans to roll out triple-combo data in the third quarter, putting Galapagos more than a year behind.""On the positive side, the CF portfolio has multiple shots on goal and when the program does get the green light, Galapagos is planning to execute on multiple triple-combinations mimicking competitor Vertex,"" he said.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Galapagos stock fell 1.9% to close at 77.35, while shares of Vertex jumped 6.7% to 134.83.Both firms are taking a triple-pill approach to treating cystic fibrosis, a disease of the lungs and digestive system. The triplet combinations are expected to be able to treat the genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex stock is among four biotechs that should be on your watchlist now. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at Vertex and its strongest peers.Galapagos is working to narrow down seven potential contenders for the final triplet. But the delay in beginning its trials will likely mean Galapagos and partner AbbVie (ABBV) can't finalize their selections until 2019, Chattopadhyay said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan anticipated the delay given ""the relatively aggressive timelines the company had laid out previously."" Galapagos will first focus on the U.K. market before expanding its triplet to other countries, he said in a note to clients.According to a cystic fibrosis market, Galapagos' drug will need to show a 5% improvement over a non-drug placebo to be clinically meaningful in trials. She sees Galapagos grabbing an opening if it can prove its drug is equivalent to Vertex's.""She also sees a potential place for a new player on the market given the increased flexibility it will give patients and physicians in both terms of enrolling patients in new clinical trials and prescribing medicines once they are available commercially,"" Divan said.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?Vertex Rockets To 14-Month High On Cystic Fibrosis Drug ResultsGalapagos Cystic Fibrosis Drug Trials Vertex's 'Mega-Franchise': RBC

145,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) cystic fibrosis drug sales popped 22% in the first quarter, helping drive a $200 million-plus sales beat and profit that topped Wall Street's expectations by a penny.In after-hours trading, Vertex stock lifted 1.7%, near 119.40, after closing up less than 1%, at 117.23. Shares are up 59% for the year, outperforming IBD's 425-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is up just 12.3% since January.For the first quarter ended March 31, Vertex reported $714.7 million in sales, up 80% vs. the year-earlier period. That was helped by a $230 million collaborative payment from Merck KGaA in the quarter. Of that, $36.4 million was paid in taxes to German authorities, but Vertex filed for, and expects, a refund.Sales easily beat analysts' expectations for $510.55 million, but without the $230 million in collaborative payments from Merck KGaA they would have lagged the model by about $26 million. Adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share grew 356% and beat by a penny.Vertex's bread-and-butter segment, cystic fibrosis, saw sales grow 22% to $480.6 million in the first quarter. Orkambi and Kalydeco, CF drugs, brought in $294.9 million and $185.7 million in sales, respectively, growing 32.2% and 8.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms all but 2% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Vertex saw continued uptake in Orkambi among children age 6-11 in the U.S. and completed an application for the same group of patients with regulators in Europe, CEO Jeffrey Leiden said in a statement.During the quarter, Vertex also unveiled strong data from two Phase 3 studies combining tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis. The combination showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function for patients with the disorder.The company is also looking at four potential drugs that could be combined with tezacaftor and ivacaftor to create a triple-pill for cystic fibrosis patients. Vertex expects three to have data in the second half of 2017 and one to have data in early 2018.""We remain focused on advancing key CF programs, including our triple combination regimens, to support our goal of providing treatments for all people with CF,"" Leiden said.RELATED:AbbVie Hovers Near Buy Point After Q1 Earnings, Sales TopCelgene Dips On $95 Million Lag In Psoriasis Sales, But Earnings TopBristol-Myers Stock Pops On Street-Crushing Q1 Revenue, Profits

146,CF,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK

147,CF,"No. 2 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) will likely guide to declining 2017 sales, hamstrung on limited Hepatitis C visibility, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday, noting expectations are better for Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), as the Q4 earnings season gets underway.For 2017, Yee expects Gilead to guide to $27 billion to $29 billion in product sales, bracketing consensus views for $28 billion. That would be down 8% at the midpoint of guidance vs. early 2016 guidance for $30 billion to $31 billion.""We appreciate that visibility is tough on Hep C right now, but buy-side consensus is also fairly low on Gilead given known uncertainties,"" Yee wrote in a research report.

"
159,CF,"CF has been on a strong run ever since. Sales and earnings have grown in triple digits three times over the past four quarters.
"
160,CF,"That growth has been driven by a spike in fertilizer prices amid heavy demand and tight supplies of corn, soybeans and other crops. With farmers enjoying higher prices on food, many are motivated to increase their acreage and output, experts say.
"

"
162,CF,"A closely watched industry report, the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour, recently said forecasts for corn crop yields will be sharply below levels previously forecast by the Department of Agriculture. This will push corn prices even higher and also boost demand for potassium and nitrogen fertilizers.
"
163,CF,"CF has benefited from a couple of other trends as well. China has reduced its exports of urea, opening up more market share for CF. Meanwhile, favorable natural gas prices have helped the company keep its production costs low.

178,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) remains ahead of Galapagos (GLPG) in developing a triple of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday after Galapagos unveiled positive phase 2 data for its first CF pill.Galapagos' GLPG-1837 lowered FEV1 ""in-line"" with data from Vertex's Kalydeco. FEV1 is a ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. GLPG-1837 and Kalydeco belong to a class of drugs called potentiators.But developing a triple is no easy feat, Yee wrote in a research report. Galapagos' and AbbVie's (ABBV) backup potentiator moved into phase 1 testing earlier this year. Its corrector, GLPG-2222, is currently in phase 1/2 testing.""This is only one CF drug and in order to have a 'triple pill' the companies have to have all three drugs look good and in combination all together in patients -- and have minimal drug-drug interactions or safety issues when dosed all at once,"" Yee wrote.Galapagos' third piece of the triple pill hasn't yet started phase 1 testing, Yee wrote. And its phase 2 test involved only seven patients who had previously been treated with Kalydeco. It's a little early to say GLPG-1837 has been derisked, Yee says.""So three drugs will not be in combination until back half of 2017, in our view,"" he wrote. He estimates Vertex is one to two years ahead after already derisking two of its three drugs. VX-152 and VX-440 -- in contention to become the third -- will begin phase 2 testing before year's end.Yee kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He sees the ""mega-franchise"" in CF as having a $1 billion potential upside. Vertex stock fell 3.65% to close at 75.84 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest in more than two years. Galapagos fell 2% to 62.68.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector isn't looking so hot now after IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group sank to No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 9 over four weeks.

179,CF,"Although Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) missed Wall Street's Q3 views late Tuesday, shares rose for a time Wednesday on the $1 billion potential upside as Vertex sends two cystic fibrosis drugs to phase 2 testing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, however, Vertex stock, which had risen more than 5% earlier, ended trading flat at 78.71. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group also was down a fraction, heading for possibly a fourth straight down day.Vertex's stock for a time rose on confidence for VX-152 and VX-440, next-generation correctors for cystic fibrosis, rather than on its Q3 metrics, which narrowly missed the Street's expectations. Vertex also plans to send two additional CF meds into phase 1 testing by year's end and early next year.""This is an important fundamental step to getting closer to a new mega-franchise that could increase consensus peak sales and add new revenue growth to go after the 30% of the CF market that is not currently addressed,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report.Yee kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock.IBD'S TAKE: M&A activity and clinical trials could have biotechs on the edge of a big rebound. Keep tabs on the Industry Snapshot for other red-hot sectors.For Q3, Vertex reported $413.78 million in sales, growing 34% from the year-earlier quarter, and 16 cents earnings per share ex items, swinging from a 13-cent loss. Analysts polled by FactSet had modeled $417.3 million and 18 cents.CF meds Orkambi and Kalydeco brought in $234 million and $176 million in sales, respectively, growing 79% and 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Orkambi narrowly beat the consensus of $233 million, but Kalydeco missed the $179 million view, Yee wrote.VX-152 and VX-440 are expected to start phase 2 testing before year's end. Safety remains a major concern, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a report. VX-440 could be teratogenic (able to halt a pregnancy) and VX-152 caused some nausea and vomiting.In phase 2 testing, pregnant patients are excluded from VX-440 and all females will be required to be on non-hormonal birth control. VX-440 will be tested for two weeks; VX-152 for two weeks based on differing therapeutic windows, Vertex said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young boosted her price target Wednesday on Vertex stock to 115 from 110, and sees a 75%-100% upside should phase 2 testing for VX-440 and X-152 support efficacy. She has an outperform rating on Vertex stock.RELATED:Pfizer-Medivation Deal Reignites Biotech Buyout SpeculationVertex Stock Slips On Drug Trial Failure, Though Not A Surprise

180,CF,"After a typically slow stretch in late August, biotech news is bound to pick up as companies prepare for the fall season of conferences and investor days. Some of the most stock-moving events will likely be updates on key clinical trials, with several expected in September.• Celgene (CELG) is due to release long-awaited midstage trial results on GED-0301, or mongersen, a drug for Crohn's disease that it licensed in 2014 for $700 million. The drug initially sparked some excitement on Wall Street because of its strong two-week remission rate, which beat even the leading injected anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, such as AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel. But the next data set will cover a full year and evaluate patients by endoscopy rather than just symptoms.Investors' confidence was somewhat shaken when Celgene refused to provide an interim analysis on the trial, which some interpreted as a lack of confidence in the numbers. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that a close inspection of earlier data also raises red flags.""If the trial is consistent with the earlier phase I/II result (on which the original investment was made), the endoscopic remission rate would be in the 60-70% range, which is well above that seen with even the best biologicals or immunomodulators,"" Porges wrote in a July 25 research note. ""In fact, our assessment of the earlier results, and the lack of CRP (C-reactive protein) response, which is a biomarker of Crohn's disease inflammatory activity, suggests to us that the result could be materially lower than the anti-TNFs, with remission rates more likely to be in the 20-30% range.""He noted that since GED-0301 is oral rather than injected, it could still find a market niche, though it would not be the mega-blockbuster initially hoped for.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biotech group has been on a roll lately, rising from No. 126 to No. 20 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings in the last eight weeks. To see what other industries are hot, follow our Industry Themes column.• Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to release headline data from Zuma-1, a phase-two trial of its CAR-T cell therapy KTE-019 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, are genetically engineered to attack cancerous cells. The trial results are crucial because Kite hopes to use them to file for FDA approval of the treatment, which could make it the first CAR-T therapy to hit the market next year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimated Friday that the study would yield a 60% to 70% overall response rate (percent of tumors that shrank) and perhaps a 40% complete response rate (tumor disappearance) based on earlier data. But in an initiation report Tuesday, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that much depends on how the data stack up against results from competitors Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), which is as yet unknown.""Novartis may present pivotal data sets at ASH 2016 along with the potential for first data from J&J's CD19 bi‐specific antibody,"" wrote Leone, referring to the American Society for Hematology conference in December. ""Juno is also expected to present clinical updates from ongoing CD19 trials.""• Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) should provide a report on its ""triplet"" pills for cystic fibrosis, consisting of its already marketed drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), combined with experimental drug VX-661 and one of two additional drugs, VX-152 and VX-440.Another trial of ivacaftor and VX-661 alone recently failed, but it did present a clean safety profile and analysts have been expecting a triplet to be the next-generation treatment in any case.Also this month, the FDA is due to render a verdict on whether to expand the label on Vertex's already marketed CF drug Orkambi to children aged 6 to 11.RELATED:Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

181,CF,"Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT) the world's second-largest producer of its namesake fertilizer, and Agrium (AGU) are in talks about a merger of equals as they battle falling prices and a decline in spending from farmers.The talks are preliminary and there's no assurance that any transaction will be agreed on, both Canadian companies said in separate statements Tuesday, confirming an earlier story by Bloomberg News about the potential combination. A deal could be announced as soon as next week, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.Potash has a market capitalization of about $14.6 billion while Agrium is valued at about $13.2 billion. Potash surged as much as 15 percent in New York, and Agrium jumped 12 percent. Trading in New York was resumed after a halt.Other fertilizer producers, including Intrepid Potash (IPI) and CF Industries (CF), also climbed.The potential deal comes as fertilizer companies struggle with depressed crop prices, which have pressured spending by farmers. Over the past year, spot potash prices in the U.S. Corn Belt have fallen 34 percent and other crop nutrients have also gotten cheaper. Potash buyers in India and China have delayed signing contracts for supplies, damping demand.Both companies have struggled to improve earnings amid weak markets, and the potential deal is probably a move to generate growth and cut costs, said Colin Isaac, an analyst with Atlantic Equities in London.""People will use this as evidence we're at the bottom of the cycle,"" Isaac said in a telephone interview. ""It's probably more about synergies and generating some growth.""The combined company would own more than 50 percent of North American potash capacity, and those assets would be the main challenge if the merger faces regulatory hurdles, Stifel analyst Paul Forward said in a note. Anti-trust concerns could be addressed by selling one or more potash assets to competitors such as BHP Billiton (BHP) or K+S AG, he said.The merger ""would likely create significant value, particularly amidst a depressed backdrop for global fertilizer prices,"" Forward said.Shares of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. were 12.3 percent higher at $18.02 at 1:42 p.m. in New York, while Calgary-based Agrium rose 6.2 percent to $95.Potash Corp. abandoned a plan to take over German rival K+S last year after its efforts were rebuffed by management amid regulatory concerns, and after the drop in potash prices prompted the Canadian company to rethink the economics of the deal.Potash Corp. cut its dividend in July for the second time this year and lowered its full-year profit forecast. Agrium cut its full-year earnings outlook this month for the second time in 2016.The potential merger is the latest in a string of mega deals in the agricultural chemical market. Negotiations between Bayer (BAYRY) and Monsanto (MON) are advancing after the German company's $55 billion takeover bid. China National Chemical Corp. agreed in February to acquire Swiss pesticide maker Syngenta (SYT) for about $43 billion, while DuPont (DD) and Dow Chemical (DOW)plan to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit.

They also show how much muscle an outfit builds to reinvest in operations, to develop and market new products, and to offer employees incentives to innovate and excel.To gauge a company's profits, take a look at pretax margins.Pretax margins can be sliced and diced a number of ways, but they aim to show earnings, before taxes, as a percentage of overall revenue. (EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a similar measure, showing a company's profitability minus the effects of accounting and financing strategies.)Margins can vary widely from industry to industry. But the ratio provides a good gauge of peer strength in any particular industry group.Among fertilizer makers, for example, CF Industries (CF) generated a 45% pretax margin in 2011. That is well above Mosaic's (MOS) 26% margin and the 13% margin for Agrium (AGU). But it lagged Terra Nitrogen (TNH), a master limited partnership that sported a 64% pretax ratio.Part of that difference is due to the companies' differing focus on nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen products have commanded somewhat higher prices this year, while the basic raw material -- natural gas -- has been unusually cheap.Agrium is more diversified, with just over a third of its pretax earnings coming from nitrogen last year. Nitrogen was more than 90% of CF Industries' pretax take, while Mosaic, on the other hand, is focused on phosphate and potassium-based fertilizers.After-tax margins help dig a little deeper. In IBD's market columns, writers frequently point out a company's margin changes on a year-over-year basis.CF's after-tax margin was 26.4% in the first quarter of 2012. That was only slightly below the fourth-quarter peak of 27.3%. Measured on year over year, CF has increased its after-tax margins in four consecutive quarters.Agrium has increased after-tax margins in eight straight quarters. Its Q1 after-tax margin was 5.7%, down sharply from 11.9% in Q4 and well below the 21.6% high notched in Q4 2008. Again, CF is on better footing.IBD's combined Sales Growth, Profit Margins and Return on Equity grade, called the SMR Rating, also incorporates margin strength. CF Industries, Agrium and Terra Nitrogen carry SMR Ratings of A. Mosaic's SMR Rating is a B.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 16, 2012, edition of IBD. CF's pretax margin was 31.6% in 2015 -- by itself, a high number, yet that margin has fallen for four years in a row. In 2011, CF's pretax margin was 45.1%.

183,CF,"Stocks  opened mildly higher Thursday, but reversed moderately lower even as European markets rallied following a rate cut by England's central bank.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1% while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 dipped 0.2%.U.S. employers sharply increased plans for layoffs in July, up 19% vs. June, according to the monthly Job Cut Report from consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The increase to 45,346 idled workers is the second straight increase, but it was still 57% below last's year's layoffs in July.First-time unemployment claims edged up to 269,000 in the week ended July 30, the Labor Department reported. That was 3,000 claims above the prior week's activity, and 4,000 claims above consensus expectations for a mild decrease. The four-week moving average inched up to 260,250 -- its first increase in five weeks.June factory orders data fell 1.5%, more than epxected.European markets held on to early gains posted after the Bank of England announced its first interest rate cut in seven years. The bank halved its key interest rate to 0.25%, said it would begin buying nearly $79 billion a month in bonds and forecast a stagnant U.K. economy this year, followed by weak growth in 2017. London's FTSE 100 led Europe's top benchmarks, up 1.5% in afternoon trade.Tesla Motors (TSLA) fell fractionally after both top- and bottom-line results missed analyst targets in the second quarter, despite a strong rise in production.3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) rose 1% after a mixed second-quarter report.Monster Beverage (MNST) was up 1% ahead of the release of its second-quarter report.Jack In The Box (JACK) spiked 11% after serving up better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and in-line revenue growth.Herbalife (HLF) jumped 2% on its first quarterly report since the end of a federal investigation into its business model. Earnings and revenue topped consensus views, but third-quarter earnings guidance undercut analyst expectations.Among IBD 50 stocks, drug maker Akorn (AKRX) rolled ahead nearly 3% after its management announced a $200 million stock buyback initiative, on top of second-quarter sales and earnings that beat views. The stock is in buy range above a 32.02 buy point in a flat base.Mobileye (MBLY) dropped 1%, possibly on Tesla founder Elon Musk's comment late Wednesday that the company was set to announce major advances in driverless technology. Mobileye had announced on July 26 that it would continue its current relationship with Tesla, but would not supply additional technology or components.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell 7%. The Woodlands, Texas-based builder reported late Wednesday its home closings slipped 1.7% in July vs. June, after solid increases in May and June. LGI Homes reports its second-quarter results Aug. 9.Oil sagged less than 1%, with West Texas Intermediate futures hovering near $40 per barrel and Brent crude above $42. Gold rose a half percent to $1,371 an ounce. The dollar turned mixed.

184,CF,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares fell Tuesday after it said late Monday that it had stopped a cystic-fibrosis drug trial due to futility.The phase-three trial was testing a combination of Vertex's ivacaftor, sold individually as Kalydeco, in combination with a pipeline drug called VX-661 to treat CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a mutation that results in minimal CFTR protein function, known as ""het/min"" patients. An independent monitoring board conducted an interim analysis and determined that there wasn't enough improvement in patient lung function to be worth continuing.Nonetheless, Vertex says the combo could work with some extra help.""These results suggest that a triple combination regimen may provide this group of people with CF the best chance at obtaining a meaningful benefit, and we look forward to beginning the first study of a next-generation corrector together with VX-661 and ivacaftor in this group of patients later this year, pending data from our ongoing phase-1 studies in healthy volunteers,"" Vertex Chief Medical Officer Jeffrey Chodakewitz said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Orkambi's launch last year turned Vertex profitable the last three quarters, but its previous years of losses have dragged on its longer-term measures such as its EPS Rating and three-year sales growth rate. Still, analysts are forecasting strong earnings growth at least through 2020, so its ratings will likely improve.Indeed, most analysts have been seeing the triple combo, rather than the double, as the successor to Vertex's currently marketed drug Orkambi, so they weren't too disappointed by the failure of the duo.""The effects of this failure on Vertex's expected entry into additional CF populations will likely be small: Expectations were low, and Vertex is continuing with plans to investigate their next-generation triplet therapies in this (het/min) patient population, with a launch potentially as early as 2019,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email. ""Success in the failed trial would have opened up this population (the largest remaining untreated CF subpopulation, with 40% of all CF patients, 12,000 patients) to treatment one to two years before it was expected, but the company has been clear that its long-term goals rest with the triple combination.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted the lack of safety issues in the trial, which is important for future combos.""Orkambi, which currently treats the majority of potentially addressable patients of VX-661, is associated with discontinuations due to side-effects that have lowered the persistence of patients on therapy and have reduced the peak revenue potential for Orkambi,"" Porges wrote in a research note. ""With a cleaner safety profile -- especially in terms of shortness of breath -- VX-661 could still increase revenues without showing superior efficacy to Orkambi or opening new patient subpopulations.""Vertex stock closed down 2.4% to 100 on the stock market today. Vertex stock hit a seven-month high of 103.73 last Tuesday, but shares are not highly rated, with an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of just 45.

185,CF,"Potash Corp. is rallying amid rumors of a possible takeover.Saskatchewan-based Potash (POT) gained 0.9% to close at C$21 in Toronto, after climbing as much as 6.6% to C$22.18, the highest price since June 24. The stock has declined 46% in the past year.On the NYSE, Potash shares rose 1.3% to 16.24.There are rumors of several unsolicited bids for the company as the stock reached historical lows, said Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. A bid may come from any of the company's competitors, including CF Industries (CF) or Agrium (AGU). And if BHP Billiton (BHP) wants to make a second attempt to acquire Potash, Oxgaard said, ""I don't think there would be a better time than this.""""It feels like the time things would be consolidating,"" Oxgaard said in a phone interview from New York.The company doesn't respond to market rumors, Potash spokesman Randy Burton said in an email.Canada rejected Melbourne-based BHPs $40 billion hostile offer for Potash Corp. in 2010 saying the bid failed to meet the criteria of providing a net benefit to the country. ""Saskatchewan province is forecast to receive C$420 million in direct royalties and taxes from the potash industry this fiscal year, down 24% from C$556 million a year earlier,"" government spokeswoman Deb Young said in an email on June 22.Potash cut its full-year profit forecast in April after crop nutrient prices declined and China delayed signing supply contracts. Potash prices have tumbled amid increased production and as farmers spend less on fertilizer amid lower agricultural commodity prices.Uralkali PJSC is the world's largest potash producer by output.

188,CF,"The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.
"
189,CF,"Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Product sales (which cover not quite all of revenue) were $2.54 billion, in line with Wall Street's revenue estimate.
"
190,CF,"Celgene is scheduled to report final Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.
"
191,CF,"For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.
"
192,CF,"Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.
"
193,CF,"Celgene also said that in March, Bob Hugin, who's led the company for 17 years, will become executive chairman and hand the CEO job over to Mark Alles, currently the president and COO. Alles, in turn, will hand his position to Jacqualyn Fouse, now the president of Celgene's hematology and oncology franchise, which makes up the majority of its business.
"
194,CF,"Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.
"
195,CF,"Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.
"
196,CF,"Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""
"
197,CF,"Analysts were divided about the management changes. Schoenebaum wrote that the changes had generally been expected, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that the CEO transition seemed early.

202,CF,"On Monday, it announced the MiniSeq System, the simplest, cheapest gene sequencer that it has yet produced. The MiniSeq, expected launch this quarter, is priced at $49,500, with each sample costing about $200 to $300 to process, CEO Jay Flatley said at the conference.
"
203,CF,"Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.
"
204,CF,"Flatley also previewed a handheld sequencing device Illumina is working on called Firefly, based on CMOS technology the company acquired a couple years ago. That will be a ways down the road, however.

212,CF,"The European Union's medical advisory committee endorsed several key drugs from leading stocks Friday, making EU approval likely for some potential blockbusters: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known by its French abbreviation, CHMP, adopted a positive opinion on Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) Genvoya to manage HIV infection. Genvoya is a four-drug combo pill identical to Gilead's popular treatment Stribild, except that in place of one ingredient, Viread, Gilead has put its new drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).TAF is known around Wall Street as ""son of Viread"" because it's a similar compound, but altered so that a lower dose can be used which in turn reduces side effects. Crucially for Gilead, it also won't hit Viread's patent expiries, which are due to start in 2018. As Stribild's sales passed $1 billion last year and are expected to top $2 billion next year, this is a key revenue driver even for a company as big as Gilead. The CHMP also endorsed two blood-cancer drugs from Amgen (AMGN). Kyprolis, which Amgen got when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, was first approved for multiple myeloma in the U.S. in 2012 but hasn't yet hit the market in the European Union. While it was first approved as a lone treatment, Amgen has been pushing a combo of Kyprolis with Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and dexamethasone, based on a successful new trial in patients who've received at least one prior therapy. The FDA approved this combo in July.Kyprolis isn't a big revenue driver for the big biotech now, but analysts expect annual sales to hit $1.7 billion by 2020.The CHMP also backed a newer drug, Blincyto, for certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blincyto is a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibody, which combine bits of two different antibodies to engage the body's T cells to attack cancer cells.Analyst expectations aren't huge for Blinctyo, but Amgen recently cut a licensing deal to use Xencor's (XNCR) longer-lasting BiTE technology to develop newer, better drugs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) Orkambi for cystic fibrosis also got the CHMP thumbs-up Friday. Orkambi gained a fair bit of media attention when it won its U.S. approval in July, as cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease with few treatments, which gives Vertex considerable pricing power. The consensus calls for annual sales to pass $5 billion by 2020.""Our models already reflect an Orkambi launch in Europe in early 2016 for CF patients 12 and older (n=12,000),"" wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a research note. ""However, we anticipate a slower launch trajectory than in the U.S. (n=8,500) due to the need to obtain reimbursement on a country-by-country basis."" Speaking of orphan diseases, Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) Ravicti also got a CHMP endorsement as a treatment for ultra-rare urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Ravicti was one of the drugs that Horizon acquired with its $1.1 billion of Hyperion Therapeutics this year, and one that Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem highlighted as a potential growth driver on March 31 when the deal was announced.""Ravicti was approved by the FDA in February 2013, and now has sales annualizing to around $105 million,"" Amsellem wrote. ""According to Hyperion, the U.S. prevalence of UCD is around 2,100. Hyperion has estimated that only around 1,100 UCD patients are actually diagnosed, and only around 675 are on treatment.""Ravicti costs $330,000 a year in the U.S., but Amsellem pointed out that's not that steep for an orphan drug and Horizon could price it higher. He did not estimate European pricing, however.Despite these endorsements, all the stocks were down on the stock market today as drug stocks continued their recent bumpy ride. In afternoon trading Friday, Gilead and Amgen shares were down 2%, and Vertex and Horizon stocks were both down 6%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

By Tuesday's close and CF near 206, the contract is priced for about $0.95 with implieds off about 20 points at 42%. The 205 put with its larger delta fared even worse with a mid-market price of $2.50 which compares to yesterday's close of $6.00. 
"
305,CF,"At the same time, call buyers also ended up on the short end of the stick. The in-the-money 195 call which maintained about two points of extrinsic value and net market price of $10.40 on Tuesday was the first deeper strike to show any profitability, but only a puny $0.40 per contract to finish at $10.80 despite the gain in shares and its mid-70s delta. From there and looking at the near, at and out-of-money calls, bulls took a systematic hit with strikes from 200 and higher all showing losses. Ultimately, Tuesday's relatively small move wasn't enough to prevent time decay and lower implieds from eating away at the price of those contracts.

306,CF,"It becomes quite obvious the big winner(s) are those traders which took the other side of being long puts, calls, straddles, strangles and the likes. In fact, even a miscued stock hedge or two during the day in order to keep the delta count flat, while reducing profitability should have been more a nuisance than menace. Of course, some verticals also made money depending on their positioning relative to shares. In-the-money spreads had the opportunity to expand towards max profitability and an at-the-money such as the 200 / 205 bull call spread benefited from its delta, time decay and vega allowance. 
"
307,CF,"Less obvious maybe and maybe to sow a fresh idea for option traders down the road, is the long time or calendar spread. Last night's decent volatility skew between contract months and fairly low implieds statistically allowed buyers of time spreads to capture profits as well. For instance, the Sept / AugWk2 205 call spread went from about $5.40 and an implied skew of nearly 25 points with the front sold contract near 60% IV and the long back month call around 35% IV, to $6.50 and virtually no skew with implieds in the low 30s for both. Now there's some food for thought that's worth fertilizing.

308,CF,"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.When the dust settled or should I say when the fertilizer settled on Tuesday's earnings reaction for agricultural chemicals producer CF Industries  (CF), shares managed to gain about 1.3% despite mixed results. Technically, CF remains situated within a six-week high handle or flat base pattern formed around its prior all-time highs set back in early May. On spot not so fortunate to rally around the results were CF Industries Weeklys options. Bulls and bears buying premium in front of the event unsurprisingly take a dip from last night's close as uncertainty surrounding the event was removed. The bad news for bearish buyers of puts, the triple whammy of being wrong on their delta bias, time decay and implieds getting mowed down by about 40% took their toll on those contracts life.

"
372,CF,"Bigger isn't always better if you're an individual investor trying to weather a choppy market.

"
381,CF,"One way to tell if the big cap you're eyeing is on the volatile side is to check out its beta, a metric that gauges a stock's sensitivity to the general market's movement in either direction.
"
382,CF,"For example, a beta of 1.50 would mean that in the past year, the stock moved 50% more than the S&P 500, either up or down.

"

387,CF,"Rentech Nitrogen Partners (RNF), a maker of nitrogen-based fertilizers, is just below a new high after clearing an 11-week base.The stock, which went public at 20 a share in November, is just 3% off its July 17 peak of 31.34. It's been choppy lately, in line with the market's volatility.The base is a second-stage pattern, increasing its chance of success over those in later stages.The Chemicals-Agricultural industry group has climbed in recent weeks as the Midwest drought has raised prices of corn and other crops. The industry was ranked No. 46 in Friday's IBD, up from 93 three weeks ago.Los Angeles-based Rentech has the highest Composite Rating in the group, a best-possible 99. That's better than rivals  Agrium (AGU) and CF Industries (CF), which are IBD 50 stocks.Rentech is expected to report on Aug. 10 that Q2 profit soared 218% from the same period last year, which would mark the third triple-digit profit increase in the past five quarters.Meanwhile, sales growth has picked up for two straight quarters, from a 10% increase in Q3 2011 to subsequent gains of 47% and 61%. After-tax margin has risen in a range of 8.6% to 50.3% over the past three quarters.Rentech shares have climbed for eight of the past nine weeks — including three up weeks in strong volume — as the stock formed the right side of its base. The bottom of the base was marked by an upside weekly reversal, a bullish sign.The stock trades fewer than 400,000 shares a day, which tends to discourage institutional investors.However, Rentech's Accumulation-Distribution Rating has risen to B from C+ in the past week, and its up-down volume ratio is 1.5, continuing a positive trend the past few weeks.

"
399,CF,"Sales growth is an important gauge. But growing sales don't tell you whether a company is truly a top-shelf or bottom-rung player. And it doesn't tell you if a company might be slashing prices to move its inventory.Profit margins can add several important dimensions to your research.Sales provide capital to fuel a company's operations. Profits reveal how effectively the company achieves those sales. They also show how much muscle an outfit builds to reinvest in operations, to develop and market new products, and to offer employees incentives to innovate and excel.To gauge a company's profits, take a look at pretax margins.Pretax margins can be sliced and diced a number of ways, but aim to show earnings, before taxes, as a percentage of overall revenue. (EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a similar measure, showing a company's profitability minus the effects of accounting and financing strategies.)Margins can vary widely from industry to industry. But the ratio provides a good gauge of peer strength in any particular industry group.Among fertilizer makers, for example, CF Industries (CF) generated a 45% pretax margin last year. That is well above Mosaic's (MOS) 26% margin and the 13% margin for Agrium (AGU). But it lagged Terra Nitrogen (TNH), a master limited partnership which sports a 64% pretax ratio.Part of that difference is due to the companies' differing focus on nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen products have commanded somewhat higher prices this year, while the basic raw material, natural gas, has been unusually cheap.Agrium is more diversified, with just over a third of its pretax earnings coming from nitrogen last year. Nitrogen was more than 90% of CF Industries' pretax take. Mosaic, on the other hand, is focused on phosphate and potassium-based fertilizers.After-tax margins help dig a little deeper. In IBD's market columns, writers frequently point out a company's margin changes on a year-over-year basis.CF's after-tax margin was 26.4% in the first quarter. That was only slightly below the fourth-quarter peak of 27.3%. Measured on a year-over-year basis, CF has increased its after-tax margins in four consecutive quarters.Agrium has increased after-tax margins in eight straight quarters. Its Q1 after tax margin was 5.7%, down sharply from 11.9% in Q4 and well below the 21.6% high notched in Q4 2008. Again, CF is on better footing.IBD's combined Sales Growth, Profit Margins and Return on Equity grade, called the SMR Rating, also incorporates margin strength. CF Industries, Agrium and Terra Nitrogen carry SMR Ratings of A. Mosaic's SMR Rating is a B.

Environmental lawsuits and a 2009 San Francisco judge's court ruling have delayed or invalidated the USDA's GM crop approvals.Monsanto is a leading seller of genetically modified seed. It also sells Roundup and other herbicides.Wall Street expects Q3 EPS to rise 27% vs. the same quarter last year, to $1.60. Revenue is projected to climb 11.3% to $3.996 billion. Monsanto has beaten analyst estimates in five of the last six quarters.Some of the upside may already be built into Monsanto's numbers, though. On May 30, the firm raised its profit guidance. It guided Q3 profit at $1.57-$1.62 per share, well ahead of the Street's view at the time of $1.29.For the full year, it hiked its 2012 EPS outlook to $3.65 to $3.70 from $3.49-$3.54. Analysts expected $3.56, a view that has since been lifted to $3.70.Last Thursday, Monsanto completed the purchase of planting technology developer Precision Planting for up to $250 million, a $210 million upfront payment, plus a possible performance-based payment of up to $40 million.Also during the quarter, the company announced a three-year, $1 billion share repurchase plan, effective July 1. The program kicks in when the previous $1 billion buyback is completed.

610,CF,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CF due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.CF Industries' Earnings Top Estimates in Q1, Sales LagCF Industries swung to a profit of $63 million or 27 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018 as against a loss of $23 million or 10 cents recorded in the year-ago period. Earnings for the reported quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Net sales decreased roughly 7.7% year over year to $957 million in the quarter owing to lower sales volumes across most segments, partly offset by increased average selling prices across most segments. Sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,051 million.Segment Review Net sales for the Ammonia segment dipped roughly 24.8% year over year to $212 million in the reported quarter. Ammonia sales volumes fell 27.8% year over year to 664,000 tons owing to unfavorable weather that led to a delay in the start of the spring fertilizer application season in the Southern Plains and the Midwest. Average selling prices rose 3.9% year over year to $319 per ton due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance, partly offset by lower sales volumes. Sales for the Granular Urea segment rose roughly 10.9% year over year to $264 million. Sales volumes increased roughly 14% year over year to 982,000 tons, due to higher production volume from the company's Port Neal Nitrogen Complex. Average selling prices for granular urea rose 8.5% year over year to $269 per ton owing to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Sales at the UAN segment fell 10.7% year over year to $283 million. UAN sales volume dipped roughly 9.7% year over year to 1,669,000 in the quarter due to unfavorable weather that led to a delay in the start of the spring application season in the Southern Plains. Average selling prices were essentially flat year over year at $170 per ton. Sales at the ammonium nitrate segment fell 20% year over year to $100 million. Sales volumes fell about 26.6% to 417,000 tons as a result of unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring application season in the Northern Hemisphere. Average selling prices increased 9.1% year over year to $240 per ton due to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance.FinancialsCF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $936 million at the end of first quarter 2018, down 28.9% year over year.Long-term debt was $4,693 million, down around 18.8% year over year.Outlook For the first half of 2018, CF Industries anticipates demand in North America for nitrogen fertilizer to be on par with the first half of 2017. It expects 88-90 million acres of corn, 46 million acres of wheat and 13 million acres of cotton to be planted in the United States, coupled with 25 million acres of wheat and 21 million acres of canola in Canada. The company expects a year-over-year increase in nitrogen imports into Brazil owing to the permanent closure of two Petrobras urea plants in the country in the coming months, partly offset by lower projected corn plantings. The company expects capital expenditures for new activities to be in the range of around $400 to $450 million in 2018, factoring in higher number of plant turnarounds compared with 2017. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Average selling prices were essentially flat year over year at $170 per ton. Sales at the ammonium nitrate segment fell 20% year over year to $100 million. Sales volumes fell about 26.6% to 417,000 tons as a result of unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring application season in the Northern Hemisphere. Average selling prices increased 9.1% year over year to $240 per ton due to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Financials CF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $936 million at the end of first quarter 2018, down 28.9% year over year. Long-term debt was $4,693 million, down around 18.8% year over year. Outlook For the first half of 2018, CF Industries anticipates demand in North America for nitrogen fertilizer to be on par with the first half of 2017. It expects 88-90 million acres of corn, 46 million acres of wheat and 13 million acres of cotton to be planted in the United States, coupled with 25 million acres of wheat and 21 million acres of canola in Canada. The company expects a year-over-year increase in nitrogen imports into Brazil owing to the permanent closure of two Petrobras urea plants in the country in the coming months, partly offset by lower projected corn plantings. The company expects capital expenditures for new activities to be in the range of around $400 to $450 million in 2018, factoring in higher number of plant turnarounds compared with 2017. Price Performance Shares of CF Industries have moved up 44.3% over a year, outperforming the 31.2% gain recorded by its industry.    Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider CF Industries currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Kronos Worldwide Inc.

612,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s (CF  -  Free Report) fully-owned subsidiary CF Industries, Inc. has redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.875% senior notes due May 2018.  This was done in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the notes. The total redemption value was around $816.6 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, Dec 1, 2017. CF Industries has significantly outperformed the industry it belongs to over the last six months. The company’s shares have moved up 43% over this period, compared with roughly 24.5% growth recorded by the industry.   According to CF Industries, the global demand for urea was strong during the third quarter and imports to Brazil went up through August by roughly 50% year over year. Also, during the quarter, India issued three tenders resulting in purchase of 1.4 million metric tons of urea.   The third quarter also witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports, higher production and energy costs, a weaker dollar and strong global demand. The company expects lower Chinese urea export volumes to continue and volatility in nitrogen prices in global markets to continue through 2018. CF Industries is also well placed to gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company is also enjoying the benefit of ample natural gas supply.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus  CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

613,CF,"The fertilizer industry is showing signs of stability of late, taking succour from improved pricing and demand dynamics for certain major crop nutrients and a firming farm economy.While still-weak agricultural commodity prices remain a roadblock, strong usage in major consumer markets is driving demand for primary crop nutrients. Needless to say, the ever-growing world population and the concomitant need to beef up food supply to feed more mouths remains a prime catalyst for fertilizer demand growth.The Zacks Fertilizers industry has outperformed the broader market over the past three months. While the industry has gained roughly 12.1%, the S&P 500 has returned around 6.3%. Let’s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors.Potash Market Showing StrengthThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows. Potash prices have recovered this year after feeling gravity’s pull in 2016, supported by improving demand and tighter supply conditions. Most producers of this major nutrient, including Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  and Agrium Inc.  witnessed a spike in prices in the third quarter that drove their potash margins.Demand for potash also has been strong in key markets. Potash Corp., a major producer of the nutrient, saw healthy demand for potash in the third quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017, supported by healthy consumption trends with contracts with both China and India in place. The company envisions 2017 to be a record year for potash demand and expects global demand in the band of 62 million to 65 million tons.Potash Corp. sees strong consumption in China driven by a shift to more potassium-intensive crops like vegetables and fruits. The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil, another important market, driven by higher crop acreage and application rates. Strong affordability and the need to replenish nutrients are also expected to support fertilizer demand in North America.Moreover, the government of India’s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on fertilizers from 12% to 5% is a welcome news for famers in that country. It also augurs well for potash demand in India, one of the world’s top buyers of the nutrient.According to Agrium, potash market is expected to remain tight through the rest of 2017. As such, higher demand from major consumers coupled with tight supply should further drive up potash prices.A Rebound in NitrogenAnother positive is the recent rebound in the nitrogen space. The nitrogen market is seeing improving demand and pricing fundamentals. According to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report), a major producer, the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports and strong global demand (especially in India and Brazil). The company expects consistent global nitrogen demand growth moving ahead.Moreover, Agrium, in its third-quarter call, said that nitrogen prices have witnessed sharp increase (of more than 50%) since the lows seen in July, buoyed by low level of Chinese urea production and solid import demand from India. Higher domestic coal prices coupled with increased focus on reducing pollution has led to a reduction in Chinese urea production.Agrium also sees positive supply-demand fundamentals for nitrogen in the medium term. Continued strong demand and tighter market conditions augur well for nitrogen prices in the fourth quarter.Phosphate Market a Mixed BagExcess capacity continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first three quarters of 2017. Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through this year (with new capacity reportedly coming from Morocco and Saudi Arabia), thereby putting pressure on prices.However, demand environment for the nutrient remains favorable. The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report), one of the biggest producers of phosphate, noted in its September quarter earnings call that demand remains strong as farmers are looking to replace nutrients from the soil in most of the major regions globally. The company also envisions demand growth to absorb new supply additions.A Stabilizing Farm EconomyU.S. farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices. Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) recently released November 2017 forecast, net U.S. farm income is expected to go up 2.7% to $63.2 billion in 2017.The upturn in profits is likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories. The USDA expects cash receipts to go up 2.4% to $365.1 billion in 2017.While the USDA’s profit forecast for this year is still a far cry from the record $123.8 billion achieved in 2013, it gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom. Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers’ nutrient-purchasing decisions.Crop Pricing Remains a ConcernThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies. Prices of major crops (such as corn and soybeans) remain at their multi-year lows as markets remain awash with grains. An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017. The USDA’s harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production. The USDA, in its November report, raised its corn harvest forecast for the 2017/18 crop year. It now sees corn production to be 14.578 billion bushels, up 298 million from its October forecast, on record yield. The USDA also predicts record soybean production of 4.425 billion bushels. This is expected to aggravate the grain glut and restrict crop prices.3 Fertilizer Stocks to Bear FruitDespite a few lingering headwinds, the overall fundamentals for the fertilizer industry are improving on the back of improved demand scenario for nutrients and an upswing in the farm economy. Moreover, the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers.Below we highlight three fertilizer stocks, armed with a solid Zacks Rank, that are worth considering for investment in the prevailing operating environment.The Mosaic CompanyHeadquartered in Plymouth, MN, Mosaic is a solid choice armed with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has an expected earnings growth of 14.4% for 2017.

Mosaic also delivered positive earnings surprise of 72% in the last reported quarter.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM  -  Free Report)Santiago, Chile-based Sociedad Quimica is another attractive pick with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has an expected earnings growth of 56.9% for 2017. It also has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 32.5%. The stock has also gained 89.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Fertilizers industry’s gain of 11% over the same period.Annual estimates for Sociedad Quimica have also moved north over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 for the company’s earnings has increased by around 3.1% and 6.5%, respectively.Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI  -  Free Report)Our next pick in the space is Denver, CO-based Intrepid Potash, carrying a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an expected earnings growth of 78.7% for 2017.

614,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s (CF  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has seen its shares rally roughly 17% year to date. We believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this fertilizer company an attractive investment option.Forecast-topping Q3, Improving Global Demand: CF Industries’ adjusted loss for the third quarter came in at 39 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents for the quarter.Net sales increased roughly 27.9% year over year to $870 million in the quarter. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723 million. CF Industries also recorded highest third-quarter sales volume in the company history of roughly 4.87 million.   Per the company, global demand for urea was strong during the third quarter and imports to Brazil went up through August by roughly 50% year over year. Also, during the quarter, India issued three tenders resulting in purchase of 1.4 million metric tons of urea.  According to CF Industries, the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports, higher production and energy costs, a weaker dollar and strong global demand. The company expects a consistent global nitrogen demand growth, which should be partly driven by rising global population and industrial growth on the back of increased adoption of emission control, recovering mining sector and synthetic nitrogen products.  CF Industries is also well placed to gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company is also enjoying the benefit of ample natural gas supply.Estimates Northbound: Estimates for CF Industries have been moving up of late, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. In fact, over a month, current-quarter estimates have narrowed from a loss of 22 cents per share to a loss of 11 cents, while current-year estimates have narrowed from a loss of 62 cents per share to a loss of 35 cents.Price Performance: CF Industries has significantly outperformed the industry it belongs to year to over the past three months. The company’s shares have moved up 27.3% over this period, compared with roughly 14.9% growth recorded by the industry.  Attractive Valuation: CF Industries’ valuation is currently very attractive as the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple, which is often used to value fertilizer stocks, is 11.4, much cheaper than its industry’s average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 24.7.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Koppers Holdings Inc. (KOP  -  Free Report), Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ  -  Free Report) and Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

615,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on May 2. The fertilizer maker’s adjusted loss came in at 2 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents. Net sales increased roughly 27% year over year to $1,099 million in the quarter. It also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,039 million. CF Industries beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, while missing in one, with an average positive earnings surprise of 72.87%. CF Industries has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the last six months. The company’s shares have moved up around 47.9% over this period, compared with roughly 25% gain recorded by the industry.    Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018. Brazil imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. India is expected to import roughly 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons during the first quarter of 2018. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018. Moreover, CF Industries is likely to benefit from higher prices of nitrogen fertilizers. Higher selling prices boosted the company’s sales in the fourth quarter. Tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance supported nitrogen prices in the quarter. CF Industries expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for CF Industries for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,051 million, reflecting an increase of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter and a 4.4% decline from the sequentially prior quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling prices for the company’s Ammonia unit for the first quarter stands at $330 per ton, reflecting an expected increase of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Granular Urea segment stands at $260 per ton, representing an expected 4.8% year over year increase. Moreover, average selling price for the UAN unit is expected to rise 1.8% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $174 per ton. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Ammonium Nitrate (AN) unit stands at $223 per ton, representing an expected 1.4% year-over-year increase. In respect to volumes, ammonia sales volumes are projected to suffer a 4.6% year-over-year decline in the first quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at roughly 878,000 tons. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for granular urea sales volume is pegged at 1,036,000 tons, reflecting an 8.1% year-over-year rise. UAN sales volume is expected to dip 4.1% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 1,774,000 tons. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales volume for the AN unit is 563,000 tons, marking a 0.9% year-over-year fall.  CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

616,CF,"DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) is set to release its third-quarter 2017 results ahead the bell on Nov 2.DowDuPont was formed through the $130 billion mega-merger of chemical giants, The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont). The merger, which was closed on Aug 31, is projected to deliver cost synergies of around $3 billion and growth synergies of roughly $1 billion. This will mark the combined company’s first post-merger earnings report.DowDuPont has underperformed the industry it belongs to since it started trading on the NYSE on Sep 1. The company’s shares have gained around 6.7% over this period, compared with roughly 9.9% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDowDuPont is presently operating with three divisions – Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products. The company would eventually break up into three independent companies. The breakup is expected to take place within 18 months of the merger closing.DowDuPont recently provided its expected results for the third quarter of 2017. The company said that it expects adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents for the quarter, up 10% from the prior-year quarter. On a reported basis, the company sees earnings of 32 cents per share.Adjusted earnings for the third quarter exclude integration and separation costs, restructuring and asset-related charges, a tax related charge, amortization of DuPont's intangible assets and a gain from the sale of the ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and ionomers business.The company also envisions net sales (on a reported basis) to be $15.4 billion and adjusted net sales to be $18.3 billion (up 8% year over year) for the third quarter. DowDuPont noted that sales benefited from higher pricing and volumes in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the third quarter stands at $17,501 million.DowDuPont noted that it results in the third quarter benefited from solid demand in most of its core end-markets, higher prices and increased equity earnings. These more than offset increased feedstock costs, weak agriculture market conditions and unfavorable impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The agriculture market faced challenges from expected lower planted corn area and a delayed start to the Brazil summer season.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DowDuPont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

(CLF  -  Free Report) reported a net loss of $84.3 million or 29 cents per share in first-quarter 2018 compared with a net loss of $28.1 million or 11 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Notably, the company has the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, under which revenues will generally be recognized upon delivery for its U.S. Iron Ore customers.

620,CF,"Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) reported preliminary production results for first-quarter 2018.Preliminary gold production and sales for the first quarter were roughly 1.05 million ounces and 1.07 million ounces, respectively. Average market price for gold during the quarter was $1,329 per ounce. Preliminary copper production and sales both totaled 85 million pounds, and average market price for copper was $3.16 per pound.Notably, first-quarter gold and copper production figures highlight a sequential decline from last quarter’s reported numbers of roughly 1.4 million ounces and 99 million pounds, respectively.Moreover, the company stated that realized copper price in the first quarter is projected to be roughly 5% lower than the average first quarter market price for the metal due to provisional pricing adjustments. This reflects down trend in copper prices over the period. Shares of Barrick have lost 13.5% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s roughly 10% decline. Barrick is facing challenges from declining production. The company’s gold production fell roughly 12% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 and 3.5% for full-year 2017, impacted by sale of 50% interest in the Veladero mine and lower production from Acacia.Moreover, the company faces headwinds from higher expected costs in 2018. Its guidance for all-in sustaining costs of $765-$815 per ounce for this year reflects an increase from $750 in 2017.Higher cost guidance reflects lower expected gold production from Pueblo Viejo, Veladero and Barrick Nevada, higher costs at Acacia and increased processing of higher-cost inventory.  Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus | Barrick Gold Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBarrick currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), Daqo New Energy Corp.

622,CF,"Investors in CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately.

623,CF,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.8% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.CF Industries Q2 Earnings & Revenues Beat EstimatesCF Industries posted net earnings of $3 million or a penny per share in the second quarter of 2017, compared with a profit of $47 million or 20 cents recorded a year ago.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at 10 cents per share for the quarter, compared with earnings of 33 cents a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks were expecting loss of 8 cents on average for the quarter.Sales dipped roughly 0.9% year over year to $1,124 million in the quarter. The figure, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,031 million. Sales declined in the quarter as volumes were offset by lower average selling prices in most segments.The company said that strong second quarter performance reflects high utilization rates, record sales volume and cost efficiencies.Segment ReviewSales for the Ammonia segment rose roughly 8.7% year over year to $389 million in the reported quarter. Ammonia sales volumes rose 33% year over year to 1.2 million tons owing to additional production volumes from the new capacity expansions at Donaldsonville and Port Neal complexes. Average selling prices declined 17.8% year over year to $338 per ton due to excess global nitrogen supply.Sales for the Granular Urea segment rose roughly 7.9% year over year to $259 million. Sales volumes increased roughly 53% year over year to 1,221,000 tons, driven by additional volume available from the new urea capacity at the Port Neal nitrogen complex. Average selling prices for granular urea declined 14.2% year over year to $212 per ton owing to elevated global nitrogen supply.Sales at the UAN segment fell 22.7% year over year to $286 million. UAN sales volume fell roughly 11% year over year to 1,631,000 in the quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions in North America which resulted in late planting, delayed UAN purchases and applications. Average selling prices went down about 13.4% year over year to $175 per ton, hurt by elevated global nitrogen supply.Sales at the AN segment went up 24.4% year over year to $112 million. Sales volumes rose about 19% to 539,000 tons and average selling prices increased 4.5% year over year to $208 per ton, owing to a new long-term AN supply agreement which started in 2017.The Other segment’s sales rose around 2.6% year over year to $78 million. Sales volumes were 17% higher in the reported quarter at 503,000 tons. Average selling price decreased 11.3% to $155 per ton due to high levels of global nitrogen supply.FinancialsCF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $2,001 million at the end of the second quarter, dipping 0.3% year over year. Long-term debt was $4,986 million, down around 10% year over year.OutlookCF Industries anticipates nitrogen pricing environment to be challenging through the balance of 2017 and also in 2018, as the global markets continue to adapt to considerable capacity increase in the recent years.  According to CF Industries, the North American market is likely to remain import-dependent in the foreseeable future. UAN and urea imports through May were down 10% and 22% respectively. However, many shipments arriving after April did not enter distribution channel because of higher imports during the first quarter, which resulted in significant urea price declines. The company also noted that North America is entering into a period of seasonally lowest demand and prices, and substantial imports could pressure selling prices in the third quarter.  CF Industries expect 6.2 million metric tons of nameplate urea capacity to start-up in 2017 and 2018, and the global supply is expected to slow in the longer term.For 2017, the company expects new capital expenditures of around $400 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 42.2% due to these changes.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13.4%.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Driving FactorsBetter-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, upbeat 2018 view and the company’s internal initiatives are contributing to a rally in ArcelorMittal’s shares. The company is also gaining from its efforts to reduce debt, lower costs, improve efficiency and expand capacity.ArcelorMittal recorded a nearly three-fold year-over-year rise in its profits in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings of 90 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Moreover, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of around 39.4%.ArcelorMittal noted during its fourth-quarter earnings call that the market conditions are favorable and demand environment remains positive along with healthy steel spreads. It expects global apparent steel consumption (ASC) to grow in the range of 1.5-2.5% in 2018.In the United States, the company expects ASC growth of 1.5-2.5% in the year, considering higher construction and machinery demand. It also anticipates 1-2% growth in ASC in Europe. Moreover, ASC is forecasted to rise around 6.5-7.5% in Brazil as the economy is expected to turn around with improved consumer confidence as construction recovers.Notably, ASC in China increased 3.5% in 2017 and is expected to remain close to this level in 2018 as weakness in the real estate sector is likely to be partly offset by strong infrastructure and automotive end markets.ArcelorMittal remains focused on implementing strategic measures under its Action 2020 plan to drive profitability. The plan is a strategic roadmap for each of the company’s key segments, which targets a structural EBITDA improvement of about $3 billion. The program contributed $0.6 billion to EBITDA in 2017 with cumulative benefit of $1.5 billion.The company also remains on track with its cost-reduction actions under the program and is focused on deleveraging its balance sheet. Sustained commitment to reduce debt is leading to lower net interest expenses.ArcelorMittal is also expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high strength steels, in line with the Action 2020 program.The company has also announced a three-year investment program of roughly $1 billion at its Mexican operations, which is geared toward improving the quality and efficiency of operations.

For third-quarter 2017, it expects adjusted EBITDA growth of high-single digits from previous year's third-quarter figure of $145.9 million. Net sales for Univar’s USA segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 2.9% rise from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1,225 million. Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to rise 7.6% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $99 million for the third quarter.  Net sales for Univar’s Canada segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 46.3% decline from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $264 million. Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to decline 37.5% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $23 million for the third quarter.  Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the EMEA segment is expected to be $407 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 12.3% decline on a sequential basis. Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to decline 3.6% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $35 million for the third quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Rest of the World is expected to be $107 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 7% rise on sequential basis. Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to increase 42.9% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $7 million for the third quarter.  In the second quarter, revenues from the USA division fell around 1.8% year over year to $1.2 billion, as improvements in the company's sales force was largely offset by lower volumes. Gross profit rose 4.8% to $275.7 million in the reported quarter. Revenues from the Canada segment went up around 1.4% to $492.4 million, driven by higher sales volumes, partly offset by changes in market and product mix resulting from a soft agricultural season. Gross profit rose roughly 11.4% to $67.5 million in the quarter. The EMEA segment raked in sales of $463.7 million, up 0.8%, helped by mix enrichment and margin improvement actions that were partly offset by a decline in volume. Gross profit rose around 1.6% to $104.7 million, supported by favorable market mix and end market mix. Sales from the Rest of World unit fell 4.4% to $99.8 million as a result of softer demand and sluggish economic conditions in Latin America. Gross profit was essentially flat year over year at $18.5 million. Univar, earlier this year, outlined its long-term growth strategy and financial targets. The company announced that operational excellence, commercial greatness and “one Univar”, will spur sustainable growth. According to Univar, the company is well-poised to create significant value through three powerful growth pathways that include increased market share, improved margins and market expansion. It is also focused on increasing value for its supplier partners, customers and shareholders.  Univar Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Univar Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Univar Inc.

The company, in its second-quarter call, said that it anticipates nitrogen pricing environment to be challenging through the balance of 2017 and also in 2018, as the global markets continue to adapt to considerable capacity increase in the recent years. The company also noted that North America is entering into a period of seasonally lowest demand and prices, and substantial imports could pressure selling prices in the third quarter.  Urea prices have been under pressure due to higher nitrogen supply. High supply levels in the global nitrogen market due to capacity additions pressured pricing in the second quarter and remain a headwind in the September quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling prices for the company’s ammonia unit for the third quarter stands at $243 per ton, reflecting an expected decrease of 15.3% from the year-ago quarter.

The company’s shares have gained around 43.4% over this period, compared with roughly 32.1% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that U.S. Steel is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Steel is +2.41% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 69 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 67 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: U.S. Steel carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Factors at PlayU.S. Steel provided an optimistic view for 2017 in July. The company now expects net earnings of around $300 million or $1.70 per share for 2017, up from $260 million or $1.50 per share it expected earlier. The company is seeing positive sentiment in the markets served by Flat-Rolled and U.S. Steel Europe (USSE) units. Its Tubular unit is also gaining from operational and cost improvements and strong market conditions.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for U.S. Steel for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $3,042 million, reflecting an expected increase of 13.3% from the year-ago quarter.Net sales for U.S. Steel’s Flat-Rolled segment is projected to witness a 5.4% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $2,094 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the USSE unit is pegged at $662 million, reflecting a 14.9% year over year rise. Moreover, the company’s Tubular segment’s net sales are expected to increase by two-and-a-half fold year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $283 million.With respect to pricing, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized price for the Flat-Rolled unit for the third quarter is pegged at $735 per net ton, representing an expected 2.4% year over year increase. But this reflects an expected 0.9% decline from the sequentially prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized price for the USSE unit stands at $586 per net ton, representing an expected 16.5% year over year rise. However, this reflects an expected 5.4% decline from the second quarter.Average realized price for the Tubular segment is expected to increase 22.8% year over year and 4.4% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1,288 per net ton.U.S. Steel is expected to gain from healthy automotive demand. Also, U.S. Steel is aggressively pursuing actions to improve its cost structure through its “Carnegie Way” program that may lend some support to its third-quarter results. The company sees incremental impact from Carnegie Way benefits of $390 million for full-year 2017 as compared with 2016.While U.S. Steel’s Flat-Rolled division posted healthy results in the second quarter, the company is still facing certain operational issues in this unit. Increased outage and plant maintenance costs are affecting this division.U.S. Steel is implementing an asset revitalization plan aimed at improving its profitability and competitiveness. The plan is expected to take three-four years for its full implementation. The company sees higher plant-related spending as it accelerates asset revitalization investments and efforts. It sees maintenance and outage expenses (including those related to asset revitalization) of around $1.3 billion for the Flat-Rolled unit for 2017, higher than $950 million in 2016.The U.S. steel industry also remains hamstrung by high levels of steel imports. The American market continues to be inundated with cheap steel imports from overseas producers despite a raft of punitive trade actions. A surge in steel imports put downward pressure on U.S. steel prices during the third quarter. Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the third quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.78% and a Zacks Rank #1.

"
631,CF,"I'm surprised by the indiscriminate selling in commodities and commodity-related stocks.
"
632,CF,"Were there bubbles? Yes, but demand remains high and product shortages continue to exist.
"
633,CF,"For example, erratic deliveries of steel have caused an acquaintance of mine to put his employees on flexible work schedules. According to him, steel mills are not sticking to regular production schedules of the type of metal used for the packaging products that his company manufactures.
"
634,CF,"Not surprisingly, his customers are unhappy. But, because they lack a cost-effective alternative, they have no choice but to accept the higher prices and irregular production schedules.
"
635,CF,"Then there is fertilizer. Employees of fertilizer company Potash (POT) are on strike at a time when there continues to be a shortage of potash - a key ingredient for fertilizer. The company told Standard & Poor's that the strike should only affect non-agricultural customers. That may not sound like a big deal, until one considers that there is no room for supply disruptions across the entire industry.
"
636,CF,"Still, shares of CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) and other fertilizer stocks are getting knocked around because of the overall weakness in commodity stocks. For demand destruction to occur, one would have to assume that people are going to stop eating, ethanol is no longer going to be subsidized or a replacement for fertilizer has been found. I just don't see this happening.
"
637,CF,"Another example is natural gas. Natural gas prices have plunged by nearly 50% since early July. Yet, worldwide energy usage is growing. Plus, the Farmer's Almanac is predicting a ""numbing"" winter.
"
638,CF,"Perhaps traders think that the NOAA's forecast for above normal temperatures will be the correct one. My best guess is that those of us living in the northern states will be bundling up and complaining about our heating bills.
"
639,CF,"Of course, it is important to realize that even with the pullback, just about all commodities are still expensive. Here in the Chicago area, gas stations charge around $4 for a gallon of unleaded. Lake County, where I live, is coping with a dramatic increase in the price of road salt. Local officials say that this problem affecting many municipalities across the country.
"
640,CF,"Given the slowing economies of the Western World, some weakness in the commodity prices is logical, but we are a long way from the perceived demand destruction that seems be influencing some traders. This is why I am looking for the opportunity to add more commodity stocks to the Focus List.
"
641,CF,"The Financial Crisis
"
642,CF,"On Wednesday, I discussed the ongoing financial crisis in my Industry Rank column. In the second half of a podcast published on Thursday, I further discussed the banking industry's problems with Chuck Jaffe of Marketwatch.
"
643,CF,"In summary, I believe the financial crisis, and the housing slump, will continue into next year. Here are some reasons why:
"
644,CF,"The FDIC's insurance fund's reserve ratio dropped so low, 1.01%, that it is being forced to develop a plan for replenishing the safety net for depositors.
"
645,CF,"Banks will likely have to pay higher fees to the FDIC, at the same time they are coping with tighter net interest margins.
"
646,CF,"Nearly 1 million petitions for bankruptcy have been filed during the past 12 months; personal bankruptcies are up 28%.
"
647,CF,"Net charge-off rates for Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), and probably many other credit issuers, have been rising for several quarters.
"
648,CF,"Staying on the subject of banks, I want to mention the creativity shown by National City (NCC).
"
649,CF,"NCC is offering customers $200 to close their home-equity lines of credit.
"
650,CF,"The bank is also waiving the $350 early termination fee. It is an interesting attempt to avoid further charge-offs, but my guess is that it won't have any positive impact. Those who have the cash to pay off their home equity loans are not likely to default. And those who are at a risk of default probably don't have the cash to pay off their loans.
"
651,CF,"The more likely scenario is that NCC is trying to engage in a game of hot potato, by which its borrowers move their home equity lines to another lender. For someone who is cash strapped, $200 helps, but not enough to keep them from falling behind on their payments.
"
652,CF,"The Markets
"
653,CF,"Volume picked up this week, as was expected.
"
654,CF,"Rather than focusing on weakening inflationary pressures, traders instead viewed the falling commodity prices as another sign that the economy is having problems.
"
655,CF,"The Fed's observation that ""economic activity has been slow"" didn't help matters. Selling intensified on Thursday in response to lousy retail sales numbers and fears about Friday's employment numbers.
"
656,CF,"Last week, I called for choppy markets and this is what we are seeing.
"
657,CF,"My expectation is that the economic news won't be very good, on balance, for a while. But, also I think we are closer to a recovery than many other developed nations. It's a good market for long-term investors.
"
658,CF,"Remember, those who try to time the markets are often the ones who take large losses and miss out on the big gains. Conversely, the most successful investors never stop researching stocks.
"
659,CF,"Focus List Updates
"
660,CF,"We removed Central European Distributors (CEDC) from the portfolio. The fundamentals continue to look fantastic, but the selling pressure on the stock has been relentless.
"
661,CF,"The stock has been adversely affected by the Russian invasion of Georgia. Although CEDC is based in Pennsylvania and does a large amount of its business in Poland, it's still being adversely affected by the rotation away from Russian stocks.

663,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) has once again dipped lower after temporarily rebounding last week. The recent drop belies the company's strong fundamental composition. Estimates continue to rise, with the current-year estimate jumping to $17.68 per share from $13.01 per share 60 days ago. The next-year estimate now stands at an amazing $22.29 per share, up from $17.09 per share 60 days ago. That places this growth stock deep into value territory.

Adjusted loss came in at 2 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents.Moreover, estimates for the first-quarter and for the full-year 2018 have been going up lately reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over a month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been revised upward by 4% to 26 cents while the estimates for 2018 increased 13.9% to 90 cents.CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018.Brazil imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. India is expected to import roughly 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons during the first quarter of 2018. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018.Moreover, CF Industries is likely to benefit from higher prices of nitrogen fertilizers. Higher selling prices boosted the company’s sales in the fourth-quarter. Tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance supported nitrogen prices in the quarter.The company expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

721,CF,"CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 2.The fertilizer maker delivered a negative earnings surprise of 44.44% in first-quarter 2017. The company posted a loss of $23 million or 10 cents per share in the quarter, as against a profit of $26 million or 11 cents recorded a year ago. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at 5 cents per share for the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents.CF Industries missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while beating in one with an average negative surprise of 121.48%.CF Industries’ shares have lost around 20.9% over the past six months, underperforming the roughly 8.1% decline of its industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Watch ForCF Industries continues to bear the brunt of pricing pressure. The company is also exposed to challenging agriculture market fundamentals.CF Industries saw lower average selling prices across all segments in the first quarter. Urea prices have been under pressure due to higher nitrogen supply. High supply levels in the global nitrogen market due to capacity additions pressured pricing in the first quarter and remain a headwind in the June quarter.Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected weigh on global prices through 2017. CF Industries, in its first-quarter call, said that it anticipates uneven nitrogen pricing environment to continue through 2017. The company also noted that excess global nitrogen supply continues to pressure marginal producers in China and other regions. Additional nitrogen capacity is expected to come onstream globally during second-half 2017 including a significant increase in North America.Nevertheless, CF Industries sees demand for nitrogen in North America to be relatively strong during the spring application season for nitrogen-consuming crops. It should also gain from its efforts to expand production capacity.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 41.7%.Allegheny expects continued operating margin improvement and revenue growth in its High Performance Metals and Components unit in 2018 resulting from improved asset utilization and ongoing aerospace market demand growth.

The JV will be a 50-50 equity investment with the partners sharing its cash flows and operating profit. Moreover, all necessary regulatory and anti-trust clearances for the JV have been received on time and initial customer shipments are expected in the first half of 2018.The JV will offer cost competitive stainless sheet products made for the North American market through a unique combination of Allegheny’s innovative, low-cost Hot Rolling and Processing Facility (HRPF) and Tsingshan’s unparalleled Indonesian refining, mining and castings assets, and the JV’s unique Direct Roll Anneal and Pickle facility in Midland, PA.The JV supports Allegheny’s considerable investment in the U.S. manufacturing operations, especially its HRPF facility, which will provide value addition to the processing services for the JV’s finished products.Per the company, this move will also benefit its FRP unit that employs more than 2,000 people in the United States.

723,CF,"ArcelorMittal’s (MT  -  Free Report) subsidiary, ArcelorMittal India Private Limited (“AMIPL”) has submitted an offer in the re-bidding process for Essar Steel India Limited in connection with ArcelorMittal’s joint venture (JV) with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (“NSSMC”) to jointly acquire and manage Essar Steel.Notably, AMIPL submitted its first bid for Essar Steel on Feb 12, 2018. Last month, ArcelorMittal and NSSMC announced that they have inked a JV deal under which both companies will co-manage and co-own Essar Steel, provided AMIPL’s bid is successful.NSSMC is a leading steel company in Japan with the capacity to produce roughly 50 million tons of crude steel per annum. It also has the reputation for high-quality and innovative products. Both ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have worked together in the past and enjoyed a close collaboration for several decades in co-operating downstream high-quality finishing facilities in the United States.Notably, in 2014, ArcelorMittal and NSSMC entered into partnership to acquire AM/NS Calvert, which is a state-of-the art downstream finishing facility in Alabama. The companies made a major investment program following the acquisition, which focused on improving the facility's finishing lines to enable the production of higher-added value steel products, increase slab staging capacity and efficiency.These investments helped AM/NS Calvert to rapidly improve its performance by increasing capacity utilization rates by more than 20%. Moreover, the shipments to the automotive sector more than doubled between 2015 and 2017 while the productivity of the hot strip mill increased by more than 1 million tons since the acquisition.ArcelorMittal stated that the aim of the resolution process is to find a new, capable and strong owner for Essar Steel and maximize returns to the creditors. Given their decades of steel industry expertise along with a wide array of innovative product capabilities and industry leading R&D, ArcelorMittal believes that together with NSSMC, it has the relevant experience and credentials to become the most credible owner for Essar Steel.Moreover, there is a compelling industrial plan at the center of the offer that transforms and enhances the asset. The big integrated steel-making facility in Hazira requires technological expertise and dedicated knowledge to expand, de-bottleneck and improve its product portfolio. The companies intend to commit considerable capital expenditure to grow the asset, bring in their proprietary processes and patents along with new high-quality products to India for industries including solar and automotive.Shares of ArcelorMittal have moved up 18.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 13.1% growth.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderArcelorMittal currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

726,CF,"Monsanto Company  is slated to report second-quarter 2018 fiscal (ended February 2018) results on Apr 5, before the market opens.The company pulled off an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 46.76% over the preceding four quarters. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, its adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIncreased market penetration of INTACTA RR2 PRO and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, and stronger corn and cotton businesses will likely bolster top-line results of Monsanto’s Seeds and Genomics segment. Moreover, wider reach of the Climate FieldView platform will prove to be a major top-line driver in the quarters ahead.Monsanto believes improved glyphosate pricing, elevated volumes of XtendiMax herbicide and benefits secured from the state-of-the-art VaporGrip technology will bolster the company’s Agricultural Productivity segmental revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $964 million, higher than $888 million recorded in the preceding quarter.  Furthermore, sturdier sales, ongoing restructuring moves and diligent cost-saving initiatives are expected to boost Monsanto’s near-term profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter gross profit for the company’s Agriculture Productivity and Seeds and Genomics segments are currently pegged at $235 million and $2,891 million, respectively, higher than $180 million and $1,132 million recorded in the prior quarter.However, in the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has moved south 0.5% to $5.73 per share for fiscal 2018 (ending August 2018), reflecting bearish market sentiments.We fear that stiff rivalry in the global seeds, traits and agricultural chemical industry might curb Monsanto’s growth.Also, the company’s cost and sales remain highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Dismal agricultural products’ prices might weigh on the company’s revenues and margins.In addition, growth opportunities of the company might be limited if Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) buyout deal is blocked by regulatory authorities (anticipated to be closed by second-quarter fiscal 2018).  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Monsanto will likely beat on earnings this quarter.

The DRAP facility, which is located in Midland, PA, utilizes a continuous and efficient automated process for production of stainless sheet products by using technology that is globally available and used in production outside the United States for years.In February 2016, Allegheny idled the DRAP facility partly due to subsidized and dumped stainless imports from China.

The JV also ensures the cost effective and efficient operation of the HRPF facility. This also enables the company to create and support skilled manufacturing jobs in the United States.Allegheny is confident that its tariff exclusion request satisfies the criteria stated by the U.S. Commerce Department.

799,CF,"Shares of United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) have rallied 39.2% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 12.6%.U.S. Steel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $6.2 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 13,691.7K. The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 8%.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this steel company.Driving FactorsBetter-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, upbeat outlook and efforts to improve its operations and cost structure have contributed to the rally in U.S. Steel’s shares.U.S. Steel swung to a profit in the fourth quarter of 2017, helped by benefits from the investments in its assets. It reported net earnings of $159 million or 90 cents per share in the quarter against net loss of $105 million or 61 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 68 cents.Recently, U.S. Steel updated its full-year 2018 guidance. For the year, the company now expects EBITDA of roughly $1.7 billion (up from roughly $1.5 billion expected earlier), considering the potential market conditions resulting from the Section 232 actions and increased shipments from Granite City Works. It expects EBITDA to be roughly $250 million for the first quarter.U.S. Steel stated that the revised guidance considers two factors, namely, the market dynamics related to President Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariff on steel imports and the recently announced restarting of one of the two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at Granite City Works.U.S. Steel is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and operations on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative that includes actions such as manufacturing process/logistics improvements and savings on SG&A costs. The company realized Carnegie Way benefits of $491 million for full-year 2017, mostly in its Flat-Rolled division. These actions are also expected to deliver meaningful benefits in 2018.Notably, the company is witnessing healthy demand in the automotive space. In September last year, U.S. Steel and Japan’s Kobe Steel agreed to start construction of a new continuous galvanizing line at their subsidiaries’ joint venture, Pro-Tec Coating Company.The move is in response to growing demand for advanced high-strength steels.

In addition, net sales advanced 41% to $667.3 million due to substantially higher prices for all of its products. 
"
827,CF,"The whipsaw action we have been seeing is due to the difficulty everyone has with valuing the market, including those paid to do so.
"
828,CF,"Two things have thrown a wrench into the works.
"
829,CF,"The first is commodities prices. Oil, corn and several other commodities are trading at price levels that no one thought possible. As a result, brokerage analysts who cover companies sensitive to movements in commodity futures have constantly been forced to reevaluate their profit forecasts. This is very evident in the number of revisions for oil, coal and fertilizer companies.
"
830,CF,"The second is the fallout from the housing slump. Banks continue to write-down more loans and it's difficult to say when this will stop. (Citigroup's (C  -  Free Report) CFO, Gary Crittenden, warned on Thursday that his firm will incur ""substantial"" losses from bad mortgages.) If a company doesn't know what its true fiscal status is, how is a brokerage analyst firm supposed to know?
"
831,CF,"The result is a very large number of ongoing revisions in the energy and financial sectors. This is significant since energy and financials are two of three sectors that have the biggest influence on the S&P 500. (The third is technology.) Since valuations ultimately reflect the expectation of what a company will earn, having two moving targets make it very difficult to determine where the S&P 500 should trade at.
"
832,CF,"I don't expect the clouds of uncertainty to pass over the near-term. When oil finally does pullback, brokerage analysts will be put in a position of guessing where crude will fall to and quickly it will drop. The housing slump will extend into 2009, which means more write-offs among financials will likely occur.
"
833,CF,"The Market's Trading Range
"
834,CF,"As of Thursday, the day-to-day movement in the market had masked what was turning out to be a very wide trading range. The Dow was down approximately 600 points (4.5%) from 30 days prior, but just 300 points (-2.4%) lower than where it was three months prior.
"
835,CF,"The negative sentiment on Friday morning took the Dow notably lower. The key now becomes staying above 11,740, which was the low established on March 10. Dips below 12,000 have so far proven to be good buying opportunities, so let's see if a rebound occurs over the next several days.
"
836,CF,"Given the level of uncertainty, the volatility is not unexpected. Notably, the VIX remains far below the levels we saw earlier this year - a sign that the volatility has not turned into renewed fear.
"
837,CF,"Focus List
"
838,CF,"Four stocks were added to the Focus List on Friday:
"
839,CF,"ConoccoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) are both integrated oil companies. There is timing risk associated with the price of crude, but both have refining operations that should help earnings when oil pulls back. PBR also has interests in what could be two of the world's largest oilfield discoveries in quite some time.
"

845,CF,"Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) have rallied 23.1% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 11.2%. Freeport, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $25.7 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 19,502.8K.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this mining company.Driving FactorsForecast-topping fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, progress in exploration activities to expand production capacity and efforts to reduce debt have contributed to the rally in Freeport’s shares.The company’s reported net income (attributable to common stock) jumped more than three-folds to 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter from 21 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents.Freeport’s results benefited from improving market conditions for copper, its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline. The company generated strong cash flows and continued to strengthen its balance sheet along with advancing several long-term projects.For 2018, Freeport believes that its shareholders are well positioned to benefit from its global leadership position in copper, high-quality portfolio of geographically diverse assets and favorable copper market conditions.The company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 675,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018.Freeport is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity.Freeport’s actions to reduce debt should also boost its financial position. It has efficiently achieved its debt reduction objectives during 2016 and 2017 while retaining robust asset base for the future. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company repaid $1.7 billion debt and its total debt has also declined around 18.2% year over year to $13.1 billion at the end of 2017.Recently, Freeport issued notices to redeem $454 million total principal amount of Freeport and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC senior notes on Apr 4. The move will result in total cash interest cost savings worth $30 million per year.  Also, last month, Freeport’s board reinstated a cash dividend on its common stock and plans to declare a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share and expects an initial quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1. The move reflects Freeport’s execution of its plan to strengthen its financial position over the last two years. It is also driven by improved market conditions and a positive outlook for generating strong cash flows.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and Consensus Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

846,CF,"Fertilizer maker, CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s (CF  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock an intriguing choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of CF?An Outperformer: CF Industries has outperformed the industry over a year. The company’s shares have rallied around 23.6% over this period, compared with roughly 4.9% gain recorded by the industry. Estimates Northbound: Annual earnings estimates for CF Industries have moved north over the past month, reflecting analysts’ confidence on the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has shot up 63.6% to 90 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also increased 36.6% to $1.53 per share.Positive Earnings Surprise History: CF Industries has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 72.9%.Solid Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 for CF Industries is currently pegged 90 cents, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of a staggering 460%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 69.8% growth in 2019.Growth Drivers in Place: CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018. Based on the company’s analysis and published reports, India is expected to require the import of 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea prior to end of March to meet its fertilizer requirements for this year.Brazil also imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year, and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018.Moreover, CF Industries should benefit from higher prices of nitrogen fertilizers. Higher selling prices drove the company’s sales in the last reported quarter. Tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance supported nitrogen prices in the quarter. The company expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.CF Industries should also gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company completed a new 400,000-ton urea equivalent per year DEF unit at the Donaldsonville complex in 2017 to support the growth of its diesel fluid business.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

850,CF,"Specialty chemicals and performance materials producer, Cabot Corporation (CBT  -  Free Report), is  set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the market closes on Oct 31.  Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.7%. It reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents.Revenues increased around 13.5% year over year to $705 million in the second quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $661 million.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 6.4%.Cabot Corp.’s shares have moved up 9.9% over the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 10% growth.   Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Cabot Corp. is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cabot Corp. for the fiscal fourth quarter is +1.62%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 94 cents and 93 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderCabot Corp., in August, said that it believes that the Reinforcement Materials segment will continue to impress, although the company is expected to see modestly higher fixed costs in the fourth quarter. The end markets in Performance Chemicals are anticipated to remain strong and the segment’s volumes and product mix are expected to improve with the resolution of the unplanned downtime. Purification Solutions is expected to gain from seasonal volume growth and lower fixed costs in the fourth quarter. The company remains focused on delivering shareholder value by growing annual adjusted earnings per share by 7-10% over time.Revenues in the Reinforcement Materials segment increased 36% year over year in the last reported quarter while the EBIT went up 46% year over year, mainly supported by favorable pricing and product mix. However, the segment’s sales and EBIT declined on sequential basis due to reduced demand in Asia and higher costs.Sales from the Performance Chemicals remained almost flat year over year in the last reported quarter, while EBIT declined mainly due to the impact of unplanned downtime on volume and costs in Specialty Carbons and Formulations and higher feedstock costs.Sales and EBIT of both Purification Solutions and Specialty Fluids declined year over year in the fiscal third quarter. While the Purification Solutions segment was adversely affected by unfavorable product mix, lower volumes and increase in fixed costs associated with a plant disruption, the Specialty Fluids experienced lower project activity in the North Sea.Cabot Corp.’s revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter is projected to rise 10.9% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $686.5 million.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.78% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.  CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

851,CF,"The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 31. Mosaic reported net earnings of 28 cents in second-quarter 2017 against net loss of 3 cents per share recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings were 29 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The company’s revenues rose roughly 4.8% year over year to $1,754.6 million in the reported quarter, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,649.4 million. Mosaic topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average beat of 63.4%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Factors to Consider Mosaic expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2.2-2.5 million tons for the third quarter compared with 2.5 million tons for the same quarter in 2016. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected to be in the range of $310-$330 per ton. The segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the band of 7-9%. Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 1.9-2.2 million tons for the third quarter, compared with 2.2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected in the band of $165-$180 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be in the band of 15-18%. Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 2.3-2.6 million tons for the third quarter, compared with 2.2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. The segment gross margin is estimated to be in the low-$20 per ton range. Mosaic, last month, issued an update on its third-quarter business performance post Hurricane Irma. The company witnessed good demand and strong operational performance prior to the hurricane with profitability metrics tracking ahead of the third quarter guidance. Post the mayhem of Irma, Mosaic now expects roughly 250,000 to 350,000 tons of lower production in September. In addition to this, the damage to Mosaic's Bartow warehouse is anticipated to result in a loss of up to 400,000 tons of finished phosphate product. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Phosphate segment is is pegged at $878 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 9.9% decline from the second quarter. Segment sales volume is also expected to decline 7.7% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.4 million tons for the third quarter.  Potash segment’s net sales are expected to fall 5.3% sequentially in the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $443 million. A 3.3% decrease in sales volume is anticipated as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.1 million tons for the third quarter.  Net sales for Mosaic’s International Distribution segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a surge of 45.8% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $850 million. Segment sales volume is also expected to jump around 50% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.4 million tons for the third quarter. Mosaic is expected to benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company is also anticipated to gain from improving global demand for fertilizers and cost-reduction measures.  However, the company is exposed to a difficult pricing environment. Lower pricing is hurting sales and margins in its phosphate business and is expected to remain a headwind in the third quarter. Mosaic also faces a challenging operating environment in the agriculture space. Mosaic has underperformed the industry over the past three months. The company’s shares have declined around 12.5% over this period as against roughly 14.7% gain recorded by the industry.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model shows that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently +2.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Mosaic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. Stocks With Favorable Combination Here are some companies in the basic material space you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.14% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

853,CF,"Investors in CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 18th, 2017 $22.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CF Industries Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CF Industries Holdings is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Fertilizers industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four has dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 23 cents per share to a loss of 51 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about CF Industries Holdings right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 15%.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Driving FactorsForecast-topping fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance and strong demand fundamentals for methanol have contributed to the rally in Methanex’s shares.Methanex’s net profit (attributable to shareholders) increased nearly three-folds in the fourth quarter from $24 million or 28 cents a year ago to $68 million or 81 cents. Adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share also trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 9.1%.Methanex is poised to gain from healthy demand fundamentals for methanol, which has been driven by both traditional derivatives and energy-related applications in Asia, particularly in China.Moreover, higher methanol prices should also boost its margins. Last year, the company’s average realized prices for methanol jumped roughly 39% year over year, while the same rose 26% in the fourth quarter. Methanex noted that methanol prices improved in the fourth quarter and into the early 2018, supported by methanol supply challenges and healthy demand.  Sequentially, the company expects higher average methanol prices in first-quarter 2018.Meanwhile, the company’s Chile IV plant is progressing with its restart process and is expected to be complete by third-quarter 2018. The company expects production from its Chile operations to be higher year-over-year in 2018.Methanex is also committed to boost shareholder returns by leveraging its solid liquidity position. The company returned $388 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases last year.Moreover, last month, the company announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 33 cents per share. Methanex’s board also recently approved a new share repurchase program authorizing it to buyback up to 6,590,095 common shares. Methanex Corporation Price and Consensus  Methanex Corporation Price and Consensus | Methanex Corporation Quote Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

855,CF,"On Mar 21, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell commenced his stewardship of the central bank by raising the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point post the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) latest policy meeting. Further, the central bank has raised the economic outlook for 2018 and provided robust estimates of several key economic metrics.Powell stated that the U.S. economy is in the best of health compared with the last 10 years. A set of stimulative policies led by the massive tax cuts in December 2017, a healthy labor market operating near full employment, firmness in overseas growth and accommodative financial conditions have improved consumers income and confidence. Consequently, the blooming economic picture persuaded the central bank to raise the benchmark lending rate.A strong U.S. economy supported by a robust labor market, low inflationary expectations and anticipation of sustained earnings momentum are likely to uplift investors’ confidence significantly. Considering these positives, momentum stocks with favourable Zacks Rank are lucrative investment options.Fed Raises GDP EstimatesThe Fed also raised its forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.5% in December 2017 to 2.7%. Likewise 2019 GDP estimate has been hiked from 2.1% in December 2017 to 2.4%. Economic growth is likely to cool down in 2020 at 2% while the longer-run measures will remain stable at 1.8%.Trump administration’s decision to cut tax rate from 35% to 21% has been a shot in the arm for the U.S. economy. The new tax bill’s method of dealing with capital expenditure (companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately) is likely to result in additional investments bolstering productivity. Consequently, economic growth will remain strong for a long period.Healthy Labor MarketThe U.S. jobless rate currently stands at a 17-year low of 4.1%. On Mar 12, the U.S. Labor Department Data revealed that the economy added 313,000 jobs in February 2018, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000. Moreover, the total labor force increased by 806,000 and is now pegged slightly below 162 million. This is the highest since September 2003. (Read More: Asia Stocks Gain on Upbeat U.S. Jobs Data: 5 Top Picks)Fed’s latest projection for the labor market has added a little extra sweetness to the economic scenario. The central bank has reduced its 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3.8% from 3.9% in December 2017. Unemployment rate is likely to remain stable at 3.6% in 2019 and 2020 better than the central bank’s December projection of 3.9% and 4%, respectively. This indicates that the U.S. labor market will maintain near full employment levels over 2018-2020.High Inflationary Expectation OverblownEstimates of inflation remain mostly unchanged by the Fed. This indicates that recent hyper-sensitiveness over inflationary expectation is overblown. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation for 2018 are both projected at 1.9%, at par with December’s projection. This figure is lower than the central bank’s longer-run estimate of 2%. Fed’s projected PCE inflation rates for 2019 and 2020 currently stands at 2% and 2.1%, respectively compared with 2% for both the years estimate during December 2017.Our Top PicksThe Fed has raised 2018 U.S. GDP growth estimate from 2.5% in December 2017 to 2.7%. Solid macro-economic fundamentals, government’s tax reform and deregulation proposals along with sustained strong earnings performance are major tailwinds for the U.S. economy. Such factors are unlikely to disappear in the near term.At this stage, investment in stocks with strong earnings momentum will lucrative.

"
856,CF,"This fertilizer company had a blow out fourth quarter as the Corn Belt heats up.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy), is one of North Americas largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. 
"
857,CF,"The company is headquartered in Deerfield, IL and has nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Donaldsonville, LA and Medicine Hat, Alberta; phosphate mining and production operations in Central Florida; and a network of fertilizer distribution terminals and warehouses in the U.S. Midwest. 
"
858,CF,"CF also owns a 50 percent interest in KEYTRADE AG, a global fertilizer trader headquartered in Switzerland.
"
859,CF,"CF's share of the fertilizer market in key Corn Belt markets is 26 percent for nitrogen and 19 percent for phosphate.
"
860,CF,"On Feb 7, CF reported fourth-quarter earnings and surprised by 27.43 percent. Profit skyrocketed to $135.4 million, or $2.38 per share, from $8 million, or 14 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The quarter also included a gain of $12.9 million, or 15 cents per share, related to the value of gas derivatives.
"
861,CF,"The company easily beat the consensus analysts' estimates, which called for $1.75 a share.
"
862,CF,"Sales soared 62 percent to $852.5 million from $526.4 million in the year-ago period. The tremendous gain came from higher prices and increased nitrogen volumes.
"
863,CF,"CF also had a great 2007. Full year profit rose to $372.7 million, or $6.57 per share, from $33.3 million, or 60 cents per share, in 2006. Revenue grew to $2.76 billion from $2.03 billion.
"
864,CF,"""Tightness in this demand-driven market pushed fertilizer prices sharply higher for all of our products,"" said Chief Executive Stephen Wilson.
"
865,CF,"With all the extra cash coming in, the company also announced its quarterly dividend would rise to 10 cents from two cents, payable Feb 29 to shareholders of record on Feb 22.
"
866,CF,"After fourth-quarter earnings were reported on Feb 7, analysts moved quickly to raise estimates for the first quarter and the full year. In the last week, first quarter consensus estimates rose 28 cents to $1.74 a share from $1.46 a share.
"
867,CF,"For the full year, in the last week, two out of six covering analysts raised consensus estimates by an average of 45 cents to $8.71 a share from $8.26 a share. That consensus estimate is $2.09 higher than just 60 days ago when the consensus estimate was $6.62 a share. 
"
868,CF,"CF Industries has a P/E of 17.54, which is under the industry average of 19.2.
"
869,CF,"A recent drop in mortgage rates caused mortgage applications to soar. The Mortgage Bankers Association index of loan application volume rose 7.5% during the final full week of January. Rates on 30-year mortgages briefly hit 5-3/8%. (Bankrate.com is currently listing a national average of 5.47%. Mortgage applications overall increased last week, particularly adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), though the Refinance index declined according to data released this morning.)
"
870,CF,"The rise in applications should not be confused with an improving economic picture. Rather the rise was a reaction by savvy homeowners hoping to lock in historically low loans. Loan application volume is also going to be supported over the next few years by the large number of houses sold between 2003-2007, as 2/1 and 5/1 ARMs reset.
"
871,CF,"Applications and loan volume are two different things with the latter being more important. I have said previously that the current economic weakness is being caused by lenders restricting the pool of new borrowers. History supports my assessment. Numerous contractions have occurred when credit standards have gone from being too loose to too tight.
"
872,CF,"A survey released on Monday by the Federal Reserve suggests that the current tightening cycle will probably get worse, before it gets better. According to the Fed, ""About 55 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages, up from
"
873,CF,"about 40 percent in the October survey."" A higher proportion of lenders have also tightened standards for consumer credit, C&I (""commercial & industrial"") loans and commercial real estate loans.
"
874,CF,"The stricter standards for mortgages have been known and are a direct fallout of the rising level of defaults. Merger volume has also dropped as fewer investors are willing to fund leverage takeovers by private equity firms. Fewer loans to businesses is a concern, particularly to the extent that it slows expansion and/or investment in new equipment and machinery.
"
875,CF,"A credit card problem, however, has the potential making headlines. Both American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) took significant write-offs in the fourth-quarter. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is freezing access to credit for 161,000 cardholders within its Egg financial unit. The number equates to about 7% of Egg customers. (Egg is a British financial firm that C acquired last year.)
"
876,CF,"It is unknown whether the move by Citigroup will be replicated by other credit card companies, but many industry observers are watching. If such a trend did develop, it would worsen an already growing problem.
"
877,CF,"(Source: The January 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, Federal Reserve System)
"
878,CF,"I bring this up because financial stocks have rallied over the past two weeks. Many investors are clearly trying to pick a bottom. Although I do think financial companies are looking at easy year-over-year comparisons in the fourth-quarter of 2008, it is too early to test the waters.
"
879,CF,"Earnings forecasts are continuing to be cut en masse. As the table at the end of this article shows, 1,535 full-year forecasts have been cut on financial companies - representing nearly 30% of all downward revisions within the past four weeks. American Express, Capital One, Citigroup, Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and several other large financial institutions are Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks - an indication that they are likely to underperform the markets over the next one to three months. (AXP is a Zacks #3 Rank stock (""hold""), but estimates for this year and next are being cut.)
"
880,CF,"Multiple retailers will be reporting over the next few weeks. Investors owning shares in these companies should pay close attention not only to the actual earnings numbers, but also guidance and the trend in estimate revisions. If consumer credit continues to tighten, earnings forecasts on multiple retailers would continue to fall.
"
881,CF,"Even with the ongoing credit crunch, there are still industries with bright outlooks. One such industry is Fertilizers, a group that has been regularly featured in this column.
"
882,CF,"Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) recently exceeded fourth-quarter expectations with earnings of $1.16 per share; analysts had been expecting per share profits of $1.00. Net income approximately doubled as pricing power allowed the company to both grow revenues and expand its margins.
"
883,CF,"POT stated that North American inventories of potash, urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) declined in the fourth-quarter. The continued push to use ethanol and worldwide economic expansion are creating good industry conditions for fertilizer companies. These favorable factors are expected to continue into the foreseeable future.
"
884,CF,"Current forecasts call for POT to more than double per share earnings this year, following sharp positive revisions over the past four weeks. Based on the current consensus estimate of $7.16, POT is trading at approximately 19.5x 2008 earnings per share. POT is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock.
"
885,CF,"Two other Zacks #1 Rank fertilizer companies will be releasing fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter profits of $1.75 per share. Terra Industries (TRA) is expected to report fourth-quarter profits of 66 cents per share.

"
888,CF,"There is really no way to sugarcoat it - January has been horrible for the markets. Uncertainty about economy along with the credit crisis have dealt a one-two punch. There have also been a few surprise lefts, such as Intels (INTC  -  Free Report) disappointing guidance.
"
889,CF,"Next week could bring some sunlight, however. Unlike the current week when more 50 financial companies were reporting,.earnings headlines will shift to non-financial companies. Plus, another dose of Fed rate cuts will be right around the corner. I expect a 50-basis point rate cut, though a 75-basis point cut is not out of the realm of possibilities.
"
890,CF,"Any rebound, however, might be temporary. The economy is sputtering. Although Zacks Equity Research expects growth to rebound in the second-half of the year, whether the economy expands even by a fractional amount this quarter is open for debate. Bluntly put, even those of us who are paid to make predictions are finding our crystal balls to be rather clouded these days.
"
891,CF,"Congress is working on a stimulus package. A rebate check of $300-$600, an extension of unemployment benefits and an expansion of food stamps seem to be the likely components. Republicans are also asking for an extension of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this decade, but this is probably not a deal-breaker.
"
892,CF,"In managing the Focus List, we are taking the economic uncertainty into consideration. This weeks additions - Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Superior Energy (SPN  -  Free Report) and Tele Norte (TNE) - are intended to give the portfolio even more diversification and reduce the level of economic senstivity.
"
893,CF,"Although ACN is a consulting firm, we believe that use of outsourcing will increase if the economy becomes turbulent. CF gives us additional exposure to the agriculture sector. (Although CF has already had quite a run, earnings estimates continue to be revised upwards rise for multiple fertilizer companies. Therefore, we think there could be even more upside to the stock.) SPN provides oilfield machinery and should continue to do well even if the price of oil drops. TNE gives us additional exposure to Latin America.
"
894,CF,"We have also curtailed our weighting in the technology sector. Notably, in the days before Intels recent earnings report, 2008 estimates had been revised slightly upwards. This is why the reaction to the semiconductor giants guidance was so harsh.
"
895,CF,"And if Intel is facing headwinds, we can only assume that Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) might also be hitting a rough patch. Of course, if Hewlett-Packard does surprise to the upside, we will consider buying the stock back. In the meantime, we believe the prudent move is to keep the stock out of the Focus List - at least until the company reports and provides updated guidance.
"
896,CF,"We are continuing to look for stocks to add to the Focus List, especially ones that can either spread our exposure into other industries or provide us with a more defensive posture. Our target size for the portfolio is 30-40 stocks and we are currently at the low end of this range.
"
897,CF,"While we will look to buy on dips whenever possible, our preference is always to choose good fundamentals and rising earnings estimates over trying to time the markets.
"
898,CF,"We know the markets will rebound and we will have the Focus List prepared to benefit when the current turbulence subsides. In the meantime, continue to stick to the strategies that have benefited you in the past. I realize that the current volatility is tough, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

900,CF,"The Zacks Industry Rank is calculated by averaging the Zacks Rank for all of the companies within a specific industry. Most industry groups are assigned a somewhat messy score of 2.25 or 3.73 because of the averaging process. The only whole number generally seen is 3.0, because the Zacks Rank uses a bell curve with most companies assigned a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold""). If all of the companies within an industry are Zacks #3 Rank stocks, then the industry rank score will be 3.0.
"
901,CF,"For an industry group to be assigned a score of 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 or 5.0, it is usually comprised of just one or two companies. An example is Retail-Major Department Stores. This group is comprised of just J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), which is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock.
"
902,CF,"I bring up the topic of calculating the Zacks Industry Rank because Fertilizer, which contains five companies, starts 2008 off with a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.0. It is very unusual to see an industry group with this many companies have such a great industry rank score.
"
903,CF,"During the month of December, brokerage analysts raised their 2008 profit forecasts on Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report), Potash of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA). These stocks performed extremely well in 2007, and the upward revisions to estimates suggest the upward momentum should continue.
"
904,CF,"Why are brokerage analysts optimistic about fertilizer companies? There is speculation that potash prices could continue to rise this year. The new farm bill did virtually nothing to stop the flow of subsidies, which is a good thing for companies in the fertilizer business. The new energy bill called for a greater reliance on biofuels. Finally, globalization and economic growth in China continues to provide favorable conditions for the agricultural sector.
"
905,CF,"Going back to JCP and its Zacks #4 Rank, profit projections for both 2007 and 2008 earnings have been dropping because of concerns about consumer spending. This is not just a case of brokerage analysts singling out JCP either, we are seeing estimates being cut for several other retailers including Chicos FAS (CHS  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO), Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).
"
906,CF,"Although the data is not in, the holiday shopping season appears to have been fairly lackluster. Not horrible, but not great either. The combination of the housing slump and high energy prices has consumers feeling a bit skittish. We are also starting to see signs that credit card defaults are rising.
"
907,CF,"The majority of the estimate revisions factored into the table below are for 2008 earnings. A small proportion of estimates are for companies with fiscal years ending in January 2008 (mostly retailers). Effective Feb 1, all estimate revision data displayed in the Industry Rank tables will be for full-year 2008 or fiscal 2009 earnings.

910,CF,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last month were: The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report), Terra Industries Inc. (TRA), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) gained 36% during December as the global demand for fertilizer continues to grow. That monthly advance made this producer of phosphates and potash nutrients the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company. It was also highlighted as a top performer for the week that ended Dec 7. 
"
911,CF,"Mosaic is scheduled to report its fiscal second-quarter results next week, and analysts are expecting more of the same. Analyst expectations for the quarter are up 7.2% in the past three months. Furthermore, earnings estimates for the year ending May 2008 are up 21% from two months ago and 3.1% from one month ago. For its fiscal first quarter, earnings per share beat both the consensus and year-ago result, while net sales soared 55% to $2 billion. Terra Industries Inc. (TRA) rode a strong industry to the second spot on the top performers list for December. Shares of the nitrogen products producer jumped 26% in the month. Earnings estimates for this year remain handily above levels from three months ago. 
"
912,CF,"As reported in late October, higher nitrogen selling prices pushed third-quarter revenues to $594 million, versus $465 million in the third-quarter 2006. Earnings per share beat both the year-ago result and the consensus. Looking forward, the company is encouraged by forecasts that suggest a continued demand for nitrogen, and remains positive by its outlook for the rest of the year and first half 2008. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) made the top performers list for the month of December with shares that advanced 26%. The video games maker also made the list for the weeks ended Dec 7 and Dec 14. TTWO experienced increased attention from brokerage analysts during the month, due in part to the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV.  
"
913,CF,"Take-Two announced fiscal fourth quarter results on Dec 18, which included a net revenue advance to $292.6 million from $266.6 million. Sales were led by BioShock, NBA 2K8 and Carnival Games. In addition, its loss per share for the quarter almost halved the consensus. Its sales guidance for the fiscal first-quarter disappointed the Street, but TTWO kept its full-year outlook intact. With a strong and diverse product lineup, Take-Two Interactive seems able to capitalize on the prosperous video games industry.  CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) was featured on the top performers list for the week ended Dec 21. It stayed on the list for the entire month as shares increased 21%. Much like Mosaic and Terra Industries, CF Industries is supported by strong U.S. agricultural markets. Earnings estimates for the year ended December 2007 and the year ending December 2008 are both significantly higher than three months ago.  
"
914,CF,"CF Industries announced third-quarter earnings per share of $1.50 in late October, which marked a positive surprise of almost 43% over the consensus. The result also surged on a year-over-year basis. Net sales increased more than 46% to $582.9 million, versus $398.6 million a year earlier. The company stated that expectations for 2008 plantings, along with low fertilizer inventories, encouraged many customers to lock in assured supplies for the fourth quarter 2007 and the spring planting season in 2008. Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) made the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank list with a gain of 14%. This global provider of technical, professional and construction services was also a top performer for the week ended Dec 7. At that time, Jacobs Engineering had just announced new contracts with a hospital in Brussels and a refinery in India.  
"
915,CF,"In early November, JEC put a cap on its fiscal year with a strong quarterly report. Jacobs Engineering earned 68 cents per share, beating the consensus of 65 cents by 4.6% and easily surpassing the year-ago performance. Revenues moved higher 15% to $2.3 billion from $2 billion. The company said it enters the new fiscal year with record backlog and a robust prospect list. Earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending September 2008 are up 7.5% over the past three months and 3% over the past 30 days. 
"
916,CF,"Crude oil ended the week with a $15 surge. Weakness in the greenback enabled oil futures to gush.
"
917,CF,"Thursday's initial jump caused many energy-related stocks, including Focus List members, Encore Acquisition (EAC) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report), to rebound strongly. EOG continued to rise on Friday, but EAC was unable to buck the broader market downfall.
"
918,CF,"Investors should note that within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have raised their second-quarter and full-year profits on both companies. These revisions reflect that the fact that analysts have completely underestimated the price oil would command this year.
"
919,CF,"CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) has made a sharp rebound after falling to $123. Despite, the gain - some of which was given back on Friday, the stock remains cheap relative to future expectations.
"
920,CF,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) and SUEZ have completed a transaction that makes them 50/50 partner in the Netherlands-based premium plastics recycling company, Quality Circular Polymers (“QCP”).Notably, this partnership is the first time that a major chemicals and plastics company has joined forces with a leading resource management company to contribute to the objectives of circular economy, which will gradually develop into a critical part of the plastic value chain.For many years, LyondellBasell has been witnessing increased demand for reused and recycled plastics, particularly in Europe. The latest move helps the company to create an innovative system that can be scaled as the circular economy grows.The two partners will be able to leverage their respective strengths through this joint business. LyondellBasell will apply its vast experience in product development, leadership in innovative plastic production technology and deep knowledge of key end markets including consumer goods, where it has strong presence. SUEZ, on the other hand will utilize its leading-edge technology solutions to improve the separation, identification and preparation of materials that will be used as feedstock at QCP.The QCP plant, which is located in Sittard-Geleen, will transform used plastic material into virgin-replacement quality polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) materials. It is capable of converting consumer waste into 25,000 tons of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and PP, with an objective to convert waste into 35,000 tons later this year and further into 100,000 tons by 2020.The production capacity of the plant is capable of addressing the growing need for improving the sustainability profile of high-quality plastics in Europe. QCP's recycled products will be added by LyondellBasell in its existing range of PP and PE materials, which will help it meet the increasing customer demand, on par with the EU's Plastics Strategy.Moreover, recycling plastics is also a key market for SUEZ that has nine dedicated operational facilities in Europe. Last year, SUEZ produced 150,000 tons of new plastic resources and processed 400,000 tons of plastic waste. The company aims to increase its processing capacity by 50% to 600,000 tons in 2020.Shares of LyondellBasell have gained 13.8% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 6.5% growth. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderLyondellBasell currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

921,CF,"Shares of Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) have rallied 22.6% in the last six months. The company also significantly outperformed its industry’s gain of roughly 1.1% over the same time frame.   Eastman Chemical has a market cap of roughly $15.4 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 1,294.9K. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8.9%.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Driving FactorsA better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance and an upbeat 2018 outlook have contributed to the rally in Eastman Chemical’s shares. The company should gain from cost-cutting and productivity initiatives, synergies of strategic acquisitions as well as efforts to reduce debt.The company’s profits increased in the fourth quarter of 2017, aided by strong growth of high-margin products in its specialty businesses. The company recorded profit of $581 million or $4.01 per share, a five-fold rise from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $116 million or 79 cents. Adjusted earnings of $1.62 per share trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06.In 2018, Eastman Chemical expects to drive growth in 2018 on the back of growth investments, innovation and high margin products. It also sees modestly lower tax rate to support earnings growth. Eastman Chemical projects adjusted earnings per share growth in 2018 to be 8-12% year over year.The company is focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions, which is helping it to offset raw material cost inflation and other cost headwinds. The company expects to deliver $100 million of cost savings in 2018 under its cost-reduction program. Its cost-reduction actions are expected to contribute to its earnings per share in 2018.Eastman Chemical should also gain from its strategic acquisitions, especially Taminco Corporation. The buyout has strengthened the company’s foothold in attractive niche end-markets including food, feed and agriculture where it has a strong presence. The acquisition has also provided attractive cost and revenue synergy opportunities.Further, the company is committed to reduce debt and boost shareholder returns leveraging strong free cash flows. In 2017, it repaid $350 million of debt. Moreover, it hiked quarterly dividend for the eighth consecutive year, returning more than $646 million to shareholders during 2017 leveraging healthy free cash flows. Eastman Chemical expects to deliver strong earnings growth and generate solid free cash flow of more than $1.1 billion in 2018. Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus  Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus | Eastman Chemical Company Quote Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

"
922,CF,"U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told attendees of a global summit yesterday that world farm production needs to rise 50% by 2030 to meet demand. His remarks followed recommendations from a U.N. task force to end price controls and subsidies for biofuels. The task force also called for increasing aid and giving small farmers more support, such as seed and fertilizer.
"
923,CF,"Yesterday's speech added to a growing chorus of concern about global food shortages. Population growth, weather patterns, political mismanagement (e.g. Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabee), biofuels and global economic expansion have all contributed to the problem.
"
924,CF,"This is not a problem that can be solved quickly, but will require a great deal of resources. Part of the solution is, as the U.N. task force recommended, getting fertilizer onto more fields.
"
925,CF,"The high demand for fertilizer, as I have stated several times in this column, has resulted in strong growth for those companies that produce it.
"
926,CF,"Another Strong Earnings Report from a Fertilizer Company
"
927,CF,"Evidence of this growth was seen on Monday when Intrepid Potash (IPI  -  Free Report) reported exceptional growth for its first-quarter. The company, which went public in April, generated revenues of $84.4 million, a 75% increase from a year prior. IPI produced 3% more short tons of potash and realized an increase in its average sales price of 66%. Production of langbeinite (a specialty fertilizer) was also considerably higher.
"
928,CF,"Pro forma earnings totaled 27 cents per share, versus five cents a year ago. Quarterly estimates were not published for the company because of its recent IPO. One covering brokerage analyst does expect IPI to earn $2.05 per share this year.
"
929,CF,"Full-Year Profit Projections Keep Rising
"
930,CF,"However, several brokerage analysts do follow other fertilizer companies such as Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report) and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT). Within the past four weeks, consensus earnings estimates were revised upwards for all four stocks.
"
931,CF,"It is important to realize that the recent revisions were just the latest changes to forecasts. Brokerage analysts have been routinely increasing their profit projections on fertilizer companies for many months. For example, CF has been on the Zacks #1 Rank List since last December, the longest current streak of any stock. POT was added to the list on Jan 2, AGU has been a member since Feb 12 and MOS made the list on Mar 11. (IPI is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") because of a lack of historical earnings estimates. )
"
932,CF,"To put this longevity in perspective, the Zacks Rank is based on earnings estimate revisions made during the past 60 days, as well as recent earnings surprises. Because the Zacks #1 Rank List is limited to just the best 5% of all stocks, turnover tends be high. Approximately 70% of the stocks currently on the list have held their Zacks #1 Rank for a month or less. Just 18 stocks that were on the list in March are still currently on the list.
"
933,CF,"The revisions are notable not only for their upward trajectory, but also for their impact on valuations. AGU, CF, MOS and POT are trading at less than 20x projected 2008 profits. These are low valuations considering that these companies should realize triple-digit growth in profits.
"
934,CF,"Nonetheless, supply limitations and higher demand should allow these companies to continue pushing through price increases while also maximizing production.
"
935,CF,"Trends for the Entire Zacks Rank Universe
"
936,CF,"Until the second half of July, the number of earnings estimate revisions will be comparatively low. This is a seasonal occurrence caused by lack of quarterly results. Furthermore, during the past few quarters, there has been a larger drop in the number of estimate revisions made between earnings seasons.
"
937,CF,"This is neither a positive nor a negative, but rather a function of the calendar and the economy. For investors, the lack of revisions means one less catalyst to move the markets in either direction.

941,CF,"Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) adopted a new shareholder rights plan, replacing the current one. The new plan will be effective from Mar 29.The new plan has been designed to ensure that shareholders get equal opportunity to take part in a takeover bid and receive full and fair value for the common shares of the company. It also ensures that the shareholders of Kinross Gold continue to reap the benefits of the current plan.Notably, the plan includes amendments to the legislative framework governing takeover bids in Canada, which came into force in 2016, including extending the minimum bid period to 105 days from 35 days earlier. Also, all non-exempt takeover bids will have to satisfy a minimum tender requirement of more than 50% of the outstanding securities held by independent shareholders and requiring an extension of minimum 10 days after the minimum tender requirement criteria is satisfied.Moreover, a target issuer also has the ability to voluntarily lessen the minimum bid period, but not less than 35 days, or it may be automatically reduced in case the board chooses to advance with an alternative change of control transaction.The rights issued under the new plan initially relate to and trade with the common shares and will become exercisable only when an individual (including any party related to it) attempts to or acquires 20% or more of the outstanding shares without complying with the provisions of the plan or without approval of the board of directors. In case of acquisitions or announcement of acquisition, each right will, upon exercise, entitle a rights holder, other than the acquiring individual (and related persons), to acquire the common stocks at 50% discount to the market price at that time.Subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and shareholder ratification at the special and annual meeting of shareholders on May 9, 2018 as well as shareholder reconfirmation at annual shareholder meetings in 2021 and 2024, the plan will remain effective until the conclusion of the company’s annual shareholder meeting in 2027.Shares of Kinross Gold have lost 15.3% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 9.6% decline.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinross Gold currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

942,CF,"Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) announced the abandoning of its previously declared merger deal with Blackstone’s Rhodia Acetow business. Both parties have withdrawn the notification of the proposed joint venture (JV) from the European Commission (EC) as the companies failed to reach an agreement on acceptable terms.In June 2017, Celanese announced plans to combine its Cellulose Derivatives with Rhodia Acetow through a JV to create synergies through a global acetate tow supplier. The companies were granted competition approval without any divestitures in China, Mexico, Turkey and Russia. However, the EC required excessive divestitures, which undermines the benefits of the JV.Celanese will review its strategic options, following the disappointing approach of the EC in this case. It will also continue to meet customer needs efficiently and provide the highest level of service and quality.Shares of Celanese have dipped 0.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 3% decline.Celanese, in its fourth-quarter earnings call, stated that moving forward it expects the Advanced Engineered Materials pipeline model to evolve to an increased level of project volume and the Acetyl Chain unit to sustain the momentum from its improved model.

Average selling prices for granular urea declined 14.2% year over year to $212 per ton owing to elevated global nitrogen supply.Sales at the UAN (urea ammonium nitrate solution) segment fell 22.7% year over year to $286 million. UAN sales volume fell roughly 11% year over year to 1,631,000 in the quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions in North America which resulted in late planting, delayed UAN purchases and applications. Average selling prices went down about 13.4% year over year to $175 per ton, hurt by elevated global nitrogen supply.Sales at the AN (ammonium nitrate) segment went up 24.4% year over year to $112 million. Sales volumes rose about 19% to 539,000 tons and average selling prices increased 4.5% year over year to $208 per ton, owing to a new long-term AN supply agreement which started in 2017.The Other segment’s sales rose around 2.6% year over year to $78 million. Sales volumes were 17% higher in the reported quarter at 503,000 tons. Average selling price decreased 11.3% to $155 per ton due to high levels of global nitrogen supply.FinancialsCF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $2,001 million at the end of the second quarter, dipping 0.3% year over year. Long-term debt was $4,986 million, down around 10% year over year.OutlookCF Industries anticipates nitrogen pricing environment to be challenging through the balance of 2017 and also in 2018, as the global markets continue to adapt to considerable capacity increase in the recent years.  According to CF Industries, the North American market is likely to remain import-dependent in the foreseeable future. UAN and urea imports through May were down 10% and 22% respectively. However, many shipments arriving after April did not enter distribution channel because of higher imports during the first quarter, which resulted in significant urea price declines. The company also noted that North America is entering into a period of seasonally lowest demand and prices, and substantial imports could pressure selling prices in the third quarter.  CF Industries expect 6.2 million metric tons of nameplate urea capacity to start-up in 2017 and 2018, and the global supply is expected to slow in the longer term.For 2017, the company expects new capital expenditures of around $400 million.Price PerformanceShares of CF Industries have moved up 6.1% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 8.8% growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCF Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Akzo Nobel N.V.

991,CF,"United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) has updated its full-year 2018 guidance.For the year, U.S. Steel now expects EBITDA of roughly $1.7 billion (up from roughly $1.5 billion expected earlier), considering the potential market conditions resulting from the Section 232 actions and increased shipments from Granite City Works. It expects EBITDA to be roughly $250 million for the first quarter of 2018.Per the company, the updated guidance primarily considers two factors. These are the market dynamics related to the President Trump’s recent decision to impose 25% tariff on steel imports following the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation, and the recently announced restart of one of the two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at Granite City Works.U.S. Steel expects the impact of the Section 232 on market conditions to become clearer over the next several months, which could affect its results.

(CF  -  Free Report) and Monsanto Company (MON). Vimpel-Communications (VIP) announced last week that it will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Golden Telecom, Inc. for approximately $4.3 billion.

Among other impacts, Vimpel expects the transaction to transform it from a mobile-centric operator to an integrated service provider with an established position in high-growth broadband, data and mobile markets. 
"
993,CF,"VIP was a top-performer last week as shares gained 19.6%. Earnings estimates for this year are up 5.3% over the past two months and 2.2% over the past 30 days. Expectations for next year have also moved forward. In late November, the Russian mobile phone operator reported earnings per share that topped both the consensus and the year-ago performance, while revenue gained 44%. Buckeye Technologies Inc. (BKI) received a brokerage firm upgrade last week, which most likely helped this specialty fibers and nonwoven materials company make the top performers list for the week ended Dec 21. Shares of the company gained 19.4%. Over the past two months, earnings estimates for the year ending June 2008 are up 21%. 
"
994,CF,"Buckeye Technologies is scheduled to report its fiscal second-quarter results in late January. For its fiscal first quarter, the company announced earnings per share that improved handily year over year while also topping the consensus by almost 3.6%. The improvement was attributed to a combination of higher prices, better mix and cost control. In addition, revenue improved 3% with an especially strong performance for nonwovens shipments. L.B. Foster Company  is a leading manufacturer, fabricator and distributor of products and services for rail, construction, energy and utility markets. It was a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company last week with a gain of 13.9%. Earnings estimates have moved forward by 10.7% over the past seven trading days. Expectations are also on the rise for the quarter that ends this month as well as next year. 
"
995,CF,"Late October saw L.B. Foster report solid third-quarter results, including a 100% year-over-year increase in earnings per share from continuing operations to 64 cents. That was also enough to beat the consensus by 33.3%. Net sales advanced 42% to $135.8 million from $95.9 million. According to the company, sales for rail, tubular and construction products were very strong overall, while bottom line results as well as operating margins increased across all segments.
"
996,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) is part of the hot fertilizer segment and enjoyed substantial margin improvements in both its nitrogen and phosphate segments during the third quarter. The company rode favorable industry conditions to an 18.8% rise in the week ended Dec 21, which was more than enough to be a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank. Earnings estimates for this year are up 24% from three months ago, including a gain of 4.6% in the past 30 days. Expectations for next year have also trended higher in those timeframes. 
"
997,CF,"CF Industries announced third-quarter earnings per share of $1.50 in late October, which marked a positive surprise of almost 43% over the consensus. The result also surged on a year-over-year basis. Net sales increased more than 46% to $582.9 million, versus $398.6 million a year earlier. According to the company, the fourth quarter should display another strong performance thanks to this years large harvest, historically high crop prices, and the prospect of another excellent crop year in 2008.  Monsanto Company (MON) announced in early November that fiscal first-quarter earnings per share would more than double from the year earlier. That quarterly report is now only a week away, scheduled for Jan 3, and earnings estimates are 84% higher than one month ago. Analysts now expect 35 cents for the quarter, compared to 19 cents 30 days ago. Anticipation for the quarterly results helped this seed giant become one of the top-performing Zacks #1 Ranks for last week, as shares gained more than 13.3%.  
"
998,CF,"Thanks to that strong quarter, Monsanto also expects full-year 2008 earnings per share at the upper end of its previously announced range between $2.20 and $2.40. Looking even further out, the company expects significant organic growth over the next five years as demand continues to grow for its seed and trait products. In fact, Monsanto expects the gross profit potential of its business to double from the end of 2007 through 2012. Its growth is expected to result in an ongoing EPS growth rate in the mid-to-high teens over the next five years.
"
999,CF,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) provided earnings guidance for first-quarter 2018. The company expects earnings to be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share for the quarter. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings are expected to be higher than 54 cents per share in the previous quarter and 82 cents a year ago.For the first quarter, Steel Dynamics anticipates profitability from its steel operations to improve sequentially backed by higher shipments and metal spread expansion. Also, pricing of average quarterly steel products is expected to increase more than scrap costs. This is because prices of steel across the platform have been improving throughout the quarter aided by strong steel demand in domestic market.Moreover, Steel Dynamics expects this improving steel consumption and pricing momentum to continue during the year supported by strong steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism. The company also believes the recent steel trade actions taken by the U.S. Federal Administration are likely to reduce imports.Steel Dynamics anticipates profitability of its metals recycling platform to improve sequentially on the back of higher shipments as the demand for recycled ferrous material from the domestic steel sector increased during the quarter.However, earnings of its steel fabrication business are expected to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower shipments. Notably, the seasonally adjusted fabrication order backlog of the company is strong and the demand for the non-residential construction sector remains solid.Shares of Steel Dynamics have gained 8.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 5.5% growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSteel Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

1000,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) recently reported another strong quarter, easily surpassing analyst estimates. The basic materials sector has been very hot lately, producing multiple companies with significant quarterly gains. The stock price is locked into a very nice upward trend and appears well positioned to head higher.
"
1001,CF,"Full Analysis
"
1002,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. is the holding company for the operations of CF Industries, Inc. CF Industries, Inc. is a major producer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products. CF Industries operates world-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants in Louisiana and Alberta, Canada; conducts phosphate mining and manufacturing operations in Central Florida; and distributes fertilizer products through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. The company was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois.
"
1003,CF,"There is certainly no shortage of differing opinions about the value of ethanol as an energy supplement or alternative. While this remains a hotly contested issue there is certainly no debate on the effect agricultural production has had on fertilizer stocks. As the number of acres available both domestically and internationally continues to decrease, farmers are faced with the formidable challenge of increasing their yields to satisfy increased demand. The producers are increasingly turning to fertilizers to help them accomplish this objective.
"
1004,CF,"CF Industry Holdings, a major producer of such items has been well positioned to benefit from this dynamic. Its share of the overall U.S. fertilizer market is 23% for nitrogen fertilizer and 12% for phosphate fertilizer. In key Corn Belt markets, its share is 30% for nitrogen and 17% for phosphate. The company's strength in market share and production in a very hot sector has been reflected in its financial results, having beaten analyst earnings estimates the past two quarters by an average of 22.67%.
"
1005,CF,"On Oct. 29 the company reported another excellent quarter. Net sales rose to $582.9 million, up 46% from 2006 third quarter, driven by improved pricing in both nitrogen and phosphate. The company also reported net earnings of $86.5 million, or $1.52 per share, for the third quarter of 2007. This was well ahead of analyst estimates of $1.05 per share.
"
1006,CF,"""The sharp improvement in third quarter performance is a clear reflection of the optimism pervading U.S. agricultural markets today,"" explained Stephen R. Wilson, chairman and chief executive officer of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""Improved pricing produced substantial margin improvements in both our nitrogen and phosphate segments for the quarter,"" he added.
"
1007,CF,"Analysts continue to aggressively upgrade their estimates on the company's current-quarter-earnings and full-year forecasts. Within the past seven days the current quarter consensus estimate has risen from 99 cents to an impressive $1.44. This represents a fairly significant increase.
"
1008,CF,"The success of the company has not gone unnoticed by investors, as its stock price has doubled within the last three months.
"
1009,CF,"On Aug 10 shares bottomed out at $44 and have since put together a very impressive run. From this low at $44 a nice trend line has developed that continues to support current prices. The 21-day moving average has also provided support during the move higher and continues to do so.
"
1010,CF,"Another nice quality about the move higher is that is has been relatively smooth. Stocks that jump higher tend to be more volatile and carry with them risk to the downside. CF has not experienced any major sell-offs or corrections as it has progressed. Its gains have come incrementally, and have been sustained.
"
1011,CF,"In addition, the stochastic, the technical indicator that evaluates overbought and oversold conditions, is signaling that this stock is trading in fairly neutral territory, which means it has room to move to the upside.
"
1012,CF,"Since CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) was first presented as a Value pick on Mar 1, the company has returned an impressive 92%. The consensus earnings estimate for this year currently resides at $4.64, marking a nine-cent improvement when compared to the consensus of a month earlier. Profit forecasts for next year have risen 65 cents to $4.74 over the same period of time.

1027,CF,"The credit crunch has yet to have a meaningful impact on overall expectations for growth. Ahead of the ""official"" start of third-quarter earnings season, the Zacks Revisions Ratio, which measures the proportion of full-year earnings estimates being revised upwards relative to those being revised downwards over the preceding four weeks, is right about average at 0.82.
"
1028,CF,"To put this number in perspective, I've compiled pre-earnings season trends in earnings estimate revisions for the past two years. These numbers represent the cumulative number of earnings forecasts that have been revised during the preceding four weeks for companies within the Zacks Rank universe1.

"
1030,CF,"As you can see, brokerage analysts have not been more cautious (or less cautious) then they have at similar points over the past two years. A big reason is that in the face of a sinking greenback, record highs for crude and tightened lending standards, the economy and corporate profits are continuing to grow. As I stated last week, the median company within the within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) is projected to have generated an 8.5% increase in profits during the third-quarter.
"
1031,CF,"These numbers do conflict with some of the recent economic data that has been released. August durable goods orders declined 4.9%, the first decline since May. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index sank to a two-year low this month. The National Federation of Retailers predicted that this year's holiday shopping season will be the worse it has been in five years. Even Target (TGT  -  Free Report), whose sales had been holding up, recently slashed its September sales forecast. And I'm not even mentioning the housing numbers which just stunk.
"
1032,CF,"So how does one reconcile this difference between the trend in earnings estimate revisions and the recent economic data? Durable goods orders are volatile and a single month's change really does not tell much. The trend over the next few months will be more important, especially if there is a notable, sustained drop because it will suggest that the credit crunch is widening. At this point, I don't believe that such a scenario will develop, but I do acknowledge that it is within the realm of possibilities. Consumer confidence surveys are interesting, but they do not necessarily reflect actual spending habits. A person can say he is more worried about the economy, but continue to visit Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) everyday. Retail sales were not strong over the summer, something that has already been factored into earnings forecasts. It is possible that profit projections for many retailers will have to be cut further.
"
1033,CF,"On the other hand, there is evidence that Chicken Little is wrong about the outlook for stocks. There are many countries experiencing stronger growth than the U.S. and this adds to demand for exports. (The weak dollar makes U.S. exports more price competitive, an added plus.) Corporate balance sheets are strong overall. Demand for machinery, parts and technology (e.g. laptop computers), despite today's durable goods report, has been good. There are many companies that are enjoying pricing power. Even in retail, there are several companies that are doing just fine (e.g. Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) and Zumiez ). Plus, the U.S. economy is still growing, even if the pace of growth has slowed recently. Simply put, at the aggregate level, conditions for profit growth continue to exist.
"
1034,CF,"Last week, brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on five of the six stocks within Fertilizers. Those stocks were Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA). All five are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks.
"
1035,CF,"The upgrades reflected optimism that these companies will continue to enjoy pricing power for the foreseeable future. Demand for potash and fertilizer have been strong and are expected to remain so. It's also worth noting that the upward revisions to estimates occurred as grain prices and other agriculture-related commodities are setting either record or 52-week highs.
"
1036,CF,"The reaction to the fiscal third-quarter earnings reports from four of the major investment banking firms has been somewhat predictable given the numbers. Profit forecasts for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 were cut on Bear Stearns (BSC) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Both firms missed the consensus estimate by sizeable margins because of the turmoil in the credit markets. Lehman Brothers (LEH) missed by a penny as it too was hit by the problems in the fixed-income markets. Brokerage analysts are split on the outlook, however, with two raising fiscal 2007 profit forecasts and three cutting fiscal 2007 forecasts. Notably, no analysts raised their forecasts for fiscal 2008, whereas four cut their forecasts. Forecasts for fiscal 2008 are down ten cents from a week ago to $7.66 per share.
"
1037,CF,"Brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2007 and 2008 forecasts on Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) after the firm topped expectations by nearly 40% with profits of $6.13 per share. GS was able to employ trading strategies to take advantage of the turmoil, though not all of its hedge funds followed the same practice. Forecasts for fiscal 2007 are at a new high with brokerage analysts now expecting profits of $23.67 per share versus $21.83 a week ago. Prior to the recent surprise, the consensus forecast had been falling. For fiscal 2008, the consensus estimate calls for profits of $22.45 per share versus $21.82 a week ago. Two months ago, the consensus estimate had stood at $22.80, however.
"
1038,CF,"The big question going forward is how much merger and acquisition activity is going to occur over the next few quarters. The answer at this point is unknown. Higher raw material costs provide an incentive for companies to seek synergies through mergers as well as to grab additional market share. Investors are demanding better terms for companies that are not exhibiting financial strength, however, which is a headwind. In addition, the psychological impact of the credit crunch could make it harder for private equity firms to get favorable financing terms. This said, financing remains available for companies (and individuals) in strong financial shape.

"
1058,CF,"Life Partners has enjoyed positive momentum for several quarters in a row. In its fiscal first quarter, earnings per share of 49 cents significantly bettered both the year-ago result and Wall Streets expectation. Furthermore, revenues of approximately $17.6 million advanced year over year from $6.2 million, and total business volume soared 180%. Life Partners was a top performer for the entire month of May and appears on its way to another impressive gain in June. KMG Chemicals, Inc.

"
1059,CF,"KMG Chemicals was a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company last week with a gain of approximately 21.5%.

For the quarter, the company began to see the positive effects of increased planting in the U.S. Corn Belt and also benefited from lower costs, especially natural gas.

Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.The S&P 500 fell for fourth straight-day, its longest such stretch of decline since last December. However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5%, or 115.95 points, to close at 24,873.66. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,747.33. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,481.74, losing 0.2%.

Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries including China.Additionally, The New York Times reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents relating to Trump’s businesses. This subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.

Following this development, the Dow was the only key index that managed to end in the green.

1067,CF,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) has provided guidance for first-quarter 2018. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $1.00-$1.05 per share. This reflects a decrease from $1.20 recorded in the previous quarter and $1.11 earned a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of $1.07 per share for the first quarter.        Notably, first-quarter projected figures include an expense of 7 cents per share related to a deferred tax assets write off as a result of changes in the tax status of a subsidiary. Barring non-operating items, the company expects first-quarter performance to be better than the previous quarter but flat with first-quarter 2017.Nucor expects earnings in the steel mills unit to improve sequentially in the first quarter. Nucor noted that average selling prices for steel mill product groups have witnessed an increase since the start of this year and the company expects this positive pricing momentum to continue in the second quarter.There is considerable optimism in steel end use markets and Nucor is also encouraged by recent actions taken by the Trump administration to address the issue of illegally subsidized imports into the United States.The company expects earnings in the steel products unit to sequentially decline in the first quarter due to seasonality, while earnings in its raw materials unit are expected to improve.   Shares of Nucor have gained 6.8% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 8.2% growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

1068,CF,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CF due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.CF Industries' Q4 Earnings, Revenues Top EstimatesCF Industries swung to a profit in the fourth quarter of 2017, aided by a sizable tax benefit. The company logged a profit of $465 million or $1.98 per share in the reported quarter compared with a loss of $320 million or $1.38 per share a year ago. The company recorded a tax benefit of $491 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the reported quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted loss came in at 2 cents per share for the quarter, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents.Net sales increased roughly 27% year over year to $1,099 million in the quarter. It also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,039 million. Sales were driven by increased volumes across most segments and higher selling prices across all segments.FY17 ResultsFor 2017, profit was $358 million or $1.53 per share, compared with a loss of $277 million or $1.19 per share logged a year ago. Adjusted loss per share for the year was 25 cents.Revenues for the full year rose 12% year over year to $4,130 million.Segment ReviewNet sales for the Ammonia segment climbed roughly 63% year over year to $344 million in the reported quarter. Ammonia sales volumes rose 58% year over year to 1,207,000 tons owing to additional production volumes from Donaldsonville and Port Neal complexes and higher demand for fall agricultural applications. Average selling prices rose 3% year over year to $285 per ton, aided by a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance.Sales for the Granular Urea segment rose roughly 30% year over year to $246 million. Sales volumes increased roughly 14% year over year to 1,008,000 tons, driven by additional volume available from the Port Neal nitrogen complex. Average selling prices for granular urea rose 14% year over year to $244 per ton owing to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance.Sales at the UAN segment fell 6% year over year to $288 million. UAN sales volume dipped roughly 6% year over year to 1,920,000 in the quarter due to reduced export sales. Average selling prices were essentially flat year over year at $150 per ton.Sales at the AN segment went up 34% year over year to $125 million. Sales volumes rose about 6% to 576,000 tons on increased demand for agricultural and industrial applications. Average selling prices increased 26% year over year to $217 per ton, owing to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance and a new long-term AN supply agreement which started in 2017. FinancialsCF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $835 million at the end of 2017, down 28% year over year.Long-term debt was $4,692 million, down around 19% year over year.OutlookMoving ahead, CF Industries expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

1069,CF,"Fertilizers is appearing at top of the Industry Rank List thanks to the inclusion of three Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks, CF Industries Holdings (CF  -  Free Report), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA). The consensus estimates for 2007 earnings on all three stocks have been notably revised higher over the past 60 days, reflecting expectations for sustained strength within the agricultural sector. This year is expected to better for cattle prices, ethanol demand should benefit from still elevated oil prices and globalization is impacting rural areas in many countries, particularly China.
"
1070,CF,"Brokerage analysts expected CF to earn $1.28 per share in 2007, an increase of 26 cents over the 30-day old forecast. Comparatively, the company is expected to have earned 78 cents per share in 2006. POT is forecast to earn $7.26 per share this year versus projected income of $5.44 per share in 2006. The current 2007 consensus estimate for POT is six cents more than what brokerage analysts were forecasting a month ago. TRA should generate a profit of 60 cents this year, following an expected full-year loss of a penny per share in 2006. The current 2007 forecast is 19 cents above the projection of a month ago. None of these companies has reported 2006 fourth-quarter earnings.
"
1071,CF,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) started this week by reaffirming its guidance for both 2006 and 2007. The health insurer expects to report 2006 profits of $4.14 billion to $4.16 billion on Jan 18. UNH also expects 2007 profits to be in a range of $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion. Analysts adjusted their forecasts for 2006 per share earnings to $2.97 and 2007 per share earnings to $3.43 per share following the announcement. UNH has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters.

1072,CF,"UnitedHealth Group belongs to Medical-Health Maintenance Organizations, a group that contains one Zacks #1 Rank stock - Wellcare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report) - and five Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. Multiple companies in this group have been seeing rising enrollment rates thanks to both economic expansion and Medicare Part D. The political environment favors sustained enrollment growth, as evidenced by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's new initiative to provide universal coverage.
"
1073,CF,"Two stocks within this group with recent positive revisions in earnings estimates are Health Net (HNT) and Wellpoint (WLP). The current 2007 consensus estimate for HNT of $3.64 is ten cents above the forecast of 30 days ago and reflects changes by nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts. In mid-December, the company announced an accelerated stock buyback and this probably contributed to the positive adjustments. Last month, WLP projected 2007 profits should total $5.53 per share, a penny above the then consensus estimate. Brokerage analysts reacted by raising their forecasts above the company's guidance to $5.54 per share. Both HNT and WLP are Zacks #2 Rank stocks.

1076,CF,"United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) is set to restart one of two blast furnaces and the steelmaking facilities at its integrated steelmaking plant, Granite City Works. U.S. Steel expects to call back around 500 employees starting this month. The restarting process could take about four months.The move is expected to support the increased steel demand in the United States resulting from the pending action announced by President Donald Trump on Mar 1, following the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation on steel imports. Section 232 actions by the President recognizes the considerable threat that steel imports cause to national and economic security.Last week, President Trump announced that he will impose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a major move to protect the domestic producers of these metals, rebuild the long-struggling U.S. steel and aluminum industries and safeguard American jobs.About Granite City WorksIt may be noted here that both the blast furnaces of Granite City Works and its steelmaking facilities were idled in December 2015. In January 2016, the plant’s hot strip mill was idled in response to challenging market conditions, including unfairly traded imports and surplus global steel capacity.However, the cold mill, finishing lines and the pickle line continued to operate per customer demand. In February 2017, the company restarted the hot strip mill to address customer needs after taking the decision to speed up the pace of its asset revitalization efforts.Price PerformanceShares of U.S Steel have rallied 36.7% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 12.1% gain.Upbeat Outlook for 2018U.S. Steel, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, stated that its focus in 2018 will be on improving the fundamental drivers of business including quality, delivery, cost and safety. The company expects the performance momentum it witnessed last year to continue in 2018.For 2018, U.S. Steel expects net earnings of around $685 million or $3.88 per share and EBITDA of roughly $1.5 billion, considering market conditions at their current levels.United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus | United States Steel Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderU.S Steel currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics, Inc.

1077,CF,"On Mar 6, we issued an updated research report on WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report). Favorable industry conditions and positive volume along with pricing dynamics will drive the company’s fiscal 2018 results. Execution of its capital allocation strategy and the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report), once complete, will drive growth. However, increased debts to fund the deal along with inflationary costs of raw materials remain headwinds. First-Quarter 2018 Results Top, Upbeat Outlook WestRock’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share soared 85% on a year-over-year basis and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite commodity cost inflation, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be higher than year-ago quarter’s adjusted EPS of 54 cents. Backed by overall industry conditions, positive volume and pricing dynamics, the company anticipates strong growth in fiscal 2018. Net sales growth is projected to be up approximately 10% year over year, leading to revenues of around $16.3 billion. Adjusted segment EBITDA is likely to be higher than $2.8 billion, a 20% increase over fiscal 2017. This includes approximately $275 million-$300 million in productivity and acquisition-related synergies. KapStone Buyout Will Enhance Presence, Product Portfolio WestRock previously announced that it will acquire all the outstanding shares of rival KapStone at $35 per share. On conclusion, the deal is anticipated to be accretive immediately to WestRock's adjusted earnings as well as cash flow and lead to around $200 million of annual cost synergies and performance improvements, with half to be realized within first 12 months. KapStone’s corrugated packaging operations will enhance WestRock’s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products in geographical locations that will enable WestRock to better serve customers across the system. The deal will help the company strengthen presence in western United States and to compete better in the growing agricultural markets in the region. It also fast-tracks its target to improve margins of North American corrugated packaging business. The company will also be able to broaden portfolio of paper grades, allowing it to capitalize on the kraft bag market with the inclusion of KapStone's complementary specialty kraft paper offerings. Focus on Corrugated Packaging to Stoke Growth In a bid to tap growing demand for corrugated packaging, WestRock bought the assets of Island Container Corp. and Combined Container Industries LLC — two independent producers of corrugated boxes, sheets and point-of-purchase displays. The company purchased five corrugated converting facilities in Ohio, PA, and Louisiana, from U.S. Corrugated, a large independent manufacturer of corrugated products for packaging and displays.  The acquisition of Plymouth Packaging will help the company to tap growing on-demand corrugated packaging market. Notably, the addition of Plymouth Packaging’s Box on Demand system will enhance WestRock’s differentiation in e-commerce and other custom applications, where on-site box making is required. The buyout will also fortify its automated packaging systems business. The pending KapStone deal is another step in sync with the strategy. Inflated Costs to Hurt Q2 Transportation costs are being negatively impacted by winter weather. The winter weather is also pushing virgin fiber costs higher by 2-3%. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, commodity inflation is projected at around $40-$45 million pre-tax for the quarter. Moreover, the winter weather may have an additional $15-$20 million sequential impact. Higher Debt to Fund Deal  WestRock plans to fund the cash portion of the KapStone deal through new debt and plans to refinance KapStone's assumed debts at the close of the deal. WestRock’s current debt-to-capitalization ratio is at 37%. Higher interest expenses will affect margins.  WestRock has underperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has gained 29.5%, while the industry has recorded growth of 30.5%.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider WestRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector include Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report). Both stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Allegheny Technologies has delivered an average earnings surprise of 41.72% over the past four quarters. Its shares have rallied 56% in the past year. CF Industries has delivered an average earnings surprise of 72.87% over the past four quarters. Its shares have gained 56% in the past year. Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1078,CF,"Shares of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) scaled a fresh 52-week high of $45 on Mar 6, before closing the day at $43.20.CF Industries has a market cap of roughly $10.1 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 3,321.5K. The company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 8%.The stock has rallied 10% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 4.8% growth.Driving FactorsBetter-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance and a positive outlook have been driving the stock lately.CF Industries swung to a profit in the fourth quarter aided by a sizable tax benefit. The company logged a profit of $465 million or $1.98 per share in the quarter against a loss of $320 million or $1.38 per share a year ago. Adjusted loss came in at 2 cents per share for the fourth quarter, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents.The company expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018. Based on the company’s analysis and published reports, India is expected to require the import of 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea prior to end of March to meet its fertilizer requirements for this year.Brazil also imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year, and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018.CF Industries should also benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company completed a new 400,000-ton urea equivalent per year DEF unit at the Donaldsonville complex in 2017 to support the growth of its diesel fluid business.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

"
1080,CF,"The number of new earnings estimate revisions should be comparatively low over the next two weeks due to of the holidays. Vacation schedules will exaggerate the drop in revisions typically seen during the third month of a calendar quarter.
"
1081,CF,"For investors, this is essentially a non-event. The lack of estimate revisions is only likely to impact market activity by providing less incentive to trade stocks. Nonetheless, some brokerage analysts will be working over the holidays and, as a result, profit projections will be changed on certain companies. So keep paying attention, particularly to the stocks within your portfolio and the stocks you are thinking about buying.
"
1082,CF,"Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report) is one stock that analysts have recently raised profit projections. Revisions by two of the covering brokerage analysts have pushed the consensus earnings estimate for 2007 up 10 cents to $3.23 per share, and the consensus earnings estimate for 2008 up 30 cents to $3.82 per share.
"
1083,CF,"A peer of Mosaic, CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), also benefited from a recent change to forecasts. One analyst raised his projection earlier this month. The revised 2007 consensus earnings estimate is $5.68 per share, 25 cents higher than 30 days ago. The average per share earnings projection for 2008 is now $6.62 per share, 44 cents higher than a month ago.
"
1084,CF,"A few factors are contributing to the optimism. There is speculation that potash prices could continue to rise next year. The new farm bill did virtually nothing to stop the flow of subsidies, which is a good thing for companies in the fertilizer business. The energy bill calls for a greater reliance on biofuels. Finally, globalization and economic growth in China continues to provide favorable conditions for the agricultural sector.
"
1085,CF,"Both CF and MOS are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks and are classified in Fertilizers. This group contains one other Zacks #1 Rank stock, Terra Industries (TRA)
"
1086,CF,"During the past few weeks, there have been positive estimate revisions on 24 companies within Oil & Gas-International Integrated, Oil & Gas-U.S. Integrated and Oil & Gas-Canadian Exploration and Production. Among the beneficiaries of the higher forecasts are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks CNOOC (CEO  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report) and ENI S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report).
"
1087,CF,"Most of the revisions were made by a small group of analysts, so although the changes are broad, they don't necessarily represent a consensus opinion. Nonetheless, the longer crude stays near or above $90 per barrel, the more analysts are going to have to adjust their projections to account for higher prices.
"
1088,CF,"In the table below, I've added Zacks Revision Ratio data. This ratio is calculated by dividing the number of positive earnings estimate revisions made over the past four weeks by the number of negative revisions made over the past four weeks. A value of 1.0 means there is an equal number of positive and negative revisions. A value above 1.0 means proportionately more positive revisions are being made, a bullish sign. A value below 1.0 means proportionately fewer estimate revisions are being made.
"
1089,CF,"This ratio is useful because it eliminates variances in the number of estimates being changed, providing an apples-to-apples comparison across all industries. For example, note the very low ratios for the financial and construction sectors. These ratios are far below 1.0 because of the credit crunch and the housing slump. Conversely, Oils-Energy has a ratio above 1.0 because of the positive revisions made recently on multiple companies in this sector. In other words, energy is good (oil at $90 per barrel) and finance is bad (an increasing amount of subprime write-downs).

1092,CF,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last month were: Life Partners Holdings, Inc. (LPHI), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report), Terra Industries Inc. (TRA), TBS International Ltd. (TBSI) and J. Crew Group, Inc. (JCG). Life Partners Holdings, Inc. (LPHI) was the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank stock for three consecutive weeks in June; so its no wonder this life insurance company led the pack last month by a wide margin. Shares of Life Partners Holdings soared 79% in the month, bolstered by leading positions for the weeks ended Jun 22, Jun 15 and Jun 8. The company was also a top performer in May, gaining 25%.  
"
1093,CF,"Life Partners Holdings is engaged in the secondary market for life insurance, otherwise known as the life settlement market. According to the company, this is one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial services industry, since increasing numbers of wealthy seniors are discovering they can turn unwanted or unneeded life insurance policies into cash. As a result, the company announced strong fiscal first quarter numbers, including earnings per share of 49 cents that trounced both the Wall Street consensus and the year-ago result. Revenues of approximately $17.6 million advanced year over year from $6.2 million, and total business volume soared 180%.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) was one of the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank companies during the month of June as shares jumped 34%. The producer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products was also a top performer for the week ended Jun 15. Analysts earnings estimates for this year and the second quarter are up 6.6% and 6%, respectively, over the past seven trading days. Furthermore, earnings estimates for the year advanced more than 50% over the past three months. CF Industries Holdings is benefiting from favorable industry trends.  
"
1094,CF,"In late April, the company announced first-quarter earnings per share that reversed a year-ago loss on net sales that rose 12% to $447.7 million. Such results were helped by increased nitrogen volume and reduced costs. Volume advanced 15% as a significant increase in the nitrogen segment offset a modest decline in phosphate.Terra Industries Inc. (TRA) is a leading international producer of nitrogen products. The company is benefiting from a positive environment for nitrogen products, which helped its share price increase 31% during June. The company also finished the month with a brokerage upgrade. Earnings estimates for this year are currently at $1.60, marking a rise of approximately 16% over the past month.  
"
1095,CF,"Terra Industries will report its second-quarter results later this month. Its first-quarter report, announced in late April, displayed a healthy year-over-year improvement. Earnings per share, excluding items, bettered the consensus by more than 45% and reversed a year-ago loss. Revenues advanced 26% to $502.3 million from $398.9 million. Sales volumes for nitrogen solutions, ammonium nitrate and ammonia were up 52%, 42% and 5%, respectively, from the 2006 first quarter. Terra Industries expects positive conditions for the second-quarter as well, which could keep this company on the top performers list for a while longer.TBS International Ltd. (TBSI) finished June on a high note, making the top performers list for the weeks ended Jun 22 and Jun 29. As a result, shares of the ocean transportation service company gained 27% for the entire month. TBS International offers worldwide shipping solutions through liner, parcel and bulk services, and vessel chartering.

1104,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 14.The fertilizer maker’s adjusted loss for the third quarter was at 39 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents.Net sales increased roughly 28% year over year to $870 million in the quarter. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723 million.CF Industries beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing in the other two with an average negative surprise of 85.1%.CF Industries has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the last six months. The company’s shares have gained around 17.5% over this period, compared with roughly 14% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn November 2017, CF Industries noted that the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from the second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports, higher production and energy costs, a weaker dollar and strong global demand. The company expects lower Chinese urea export volumes to continue and volatility in nitrogen prices in global markets to continue through 2018.The company also noted that it expects improved volumes and higher nitrogen prices across all products on a year over year comparison basis for the fourth quarter of 2017. CF Industries gained from higher sales volume across all segments in the third quarter.CF Industries is likely to benefit from higher nitrogen demand. During the last reported quarter, Brazil was major purchaser of nitrogen and India issued three tenders, which resulted in purchase of 1.4 million metric tons urea.The company expects a consistent global nitrogen demand growth, which should be partly driven by rising global population and industrial growth on the back of increased adoption of emission control, recovering mining sector and synthetic nitrogen products.  CF Industries witnessed lower year over year pricing across its Ammonia, Granular Urea and Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) units in the third quarter due to higher nitrogen supply. However, the company is expected to benefit from improved pricing in the December quarter.CF Industries should also benefit from cost efficiencies in the to-be-reported quarter. It should also gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. Volumes in the company’s Ammonia unit surged around 64% year over year in the last reported quarter owing to additional production volumes from the new capacity expansions at Donaldsonville and Port Neal complexes. Moreover, volumes increased roughly 42% in the Granular Urea segment, driven by additional volume available from the new urea capacity at the Port Neal nitrogen complex.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for CF Industries for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,039 million, reflecting an increase of 19.9% from the year-ago quarter and a 19.4% rise from the sequentially prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling prices for the company’s Ammonia unit for the fourth quarter stands at $293 per ton, reflecting an expected increase of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Granular Urea segment stands at $241 per ton, representing an expected 12.6% year over year increase.Moreover, average selling price for the UAN unit is expected to rise 6% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $158 per ton. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Ammonium Nitrate (AN) unit stands at $208 per ton, representing an expected 20.9% year over year increase.With respect to volumes, ammonia sales volumes are projected to witness a 6.8% year-over-year rise in the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at roughly 0.8 million tons. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for granular urea sales volume is pegged at 1.1 million tons, reflecting a 29.2% year over year rise. UAN sales volume is expected to dip 10.5% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 1.8 million tons. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales volume for the AN unit is 562,000 tons, reflecting a 3.9% year over year rise.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus  CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | CF Industries Holdings, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CF Industries is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

The company offered an encouraging outlook for its fiscal first quarter, including a same-store sales increase of 4% to 6%, and announced a $600 million share repurchase program. Belden CDT Inc. (BDC  -  Free Report) reached 52-week highs on Mar 6 and Mar 8 due to a rebound in copper prices.

"
1109,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) was one of the best-performing Zacks #1 Rank companies in February thanks to increased demand in nitrogen and phosphate during the fall season. The company, which is a major distributor and producer of fertilizer products, continued that push in March with a gain of 11.6% last week. It also reached 52-week highs on Mar 8 and Mar 9.

The company is a provider of U.S. onshore seismic data acquisition services. Dawson Geophysical reported fiscal first-quarter earnings per share last month that jumped from the previous year and bettered the consensus by almost 27%. Revenue increased 51% to $53.7 million from $35.5 million due to the expanded capabilities of existing crews, price improvements, more favorable contract terms with clients and the fielding of two additional seismic data acquisition crews.

Net sales reached $506.2 million in the quarter, marking a 9% advance year over year from $463 million. Earnings per share increased from the year-ago quarter as well. For the full year, net sales advanced 2% to more than $1.9 billion.

"
1124,CF,"Chairman and CEO Stephen R. Wilson stated, 2006 ended on a strong note for CF Industries. The prospect of significantly higher demand for major crops such as corn and wheat in 2007, coupled with low international grain stockpiles, is expected to produce a sizeable increase in U.S. planted acreage during the coming spring season.
"
1125,CF,"With farmers expecting to plant the largest corn acreage in 60 years this spring, fertilizer prices are projected to rise sharply. The growing demand from the ethanol industry is prompting farmers to take action and plan accordingly.  
"

The consensus earnings estimate for this year currently resides at $2.44. This represents an 87.7% improvement when compared to the consensus of one month earlier.

1129,CF,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last week were: DryShips, Inc. , Blue Nile, Inc. (NILE), The Warnaco Group, Inc. (WRNC), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (POT) and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report).DryShips, Inc.  makes its first appearance on the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank list since Aug 24.

DryShips also announced its fleet renewal highlights, explaining that its fleet will consist of 46 vessels once the activity is completed with an average age just below nine years.

"
1131,CF,"Blue Nile, Inc. (NILE) displayed strong momentum by reaching the top performers list for two consecutive weeks. The leading online retailer of diamonds and fine jewelry gained 15.85% for the week ended Sep 21. Shares advanced 13.8% in the previous week.  
"
1132,CF,"In early August, Blue Nile reported second-quarter earnings per share of 23 cents on net sales of $72.1 million. EPS advanced year over year from 18 cents and beat the consensus by almost 28%. Net sales improved 26.7%. The company benefited from solid performances in all areas of its business. Blue Nile also raised its guidance for 2007. Earnings estimates for this year moved higher 13.2% over the past two months. The Warnaco Group, Inc. (WRNC) announced last week a repositioning of its Swimwear Group, including the sale of its Catalina®, Anne Cole® and Cole of California® brands. That will leave the group consisting of Calvin Klein® and Speedo®. It will also explore strategic alternatives for its Lejaby businesses. Furthermore, by Jun 30, 2008, the apparel company intends to exit all of its private label and designer swimwear businesses, except Calvin Klein. The company believes such actions will enhance its productivity and profitability. 
"
1133,CF,"Warnaco updated its fiscal 2007 guidance, and now expects earnings per share from continuing operations between $2.05 and $2.15 and revenues to grow 9% to 11% over fiscal 2006. Earnings estimates for this year are up 10.6% from two months ago, including a gain of almost 1.5% over the past seven trading days. Shares of the company gained 15.6% last week, making it one of the best-performing Zacks #1 Ranks. Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (POT) expects strong demand through 2008, according to recent statements made by its CFO at an investment conference. However, this isnt surprising news as prices for many major global crops have been at or close to historical levels for a while now. Global population growth and economic expansion in developing nations are fueling this demand. Shares of the company rose 15.5% last week.  
"
1134,CF,"Earnings estimates for this year are up 6.3% over the past two months. Potashs second-quarter earnings results turned out to be its best ever, thanks to strengthening price and volume performance in all three nutrients. Earnings per share of 88 cents beat the consensus by more than 3.5% and soared from the previous year. The company stated that the fundamentals driving its business have aligned for the foreseeable future, and it is well positioned to capitalize on the growing global need for all three primary nutrients.
"
1135,CF,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) is the holding company for the operations of CF Industries, Inc., which is a major producer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products. Shares of the company improved 14.8% for the week ended Sep 21, making it one of the top-performing Zacks #1 Ranks. Last week, CF Industries announced that it has agreed to acquire a 50% ownership position in KEYTRADE AG, a global fertilizer trading organization from Switzerland. According to the company, the combination provides CF Industries with a global platform to pursue its objectives of growth and diversification. 
"
1136,CF,"CF Industries Holdings announced second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65 in July, advancing handily from the previous years 77 cents. The result also bettered the consensus by almost 2.5%. Net sales improved 23% to $848.9 million while volume rose 6%. The quarters results were attributed to improved pricing, increased volume, and strong operating performances in its nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer businesses. Earnings estimates for the year are up 20.7% over the past two months, including a gain of 5.3% in just the past seven trading days.
"
1137,CF,"A significant drop in the number of earnings estimate revisions has started to occur. Based on a four week rolling period, 9,587 estimates were revised as of last night versus 13,079 a week ago. To put these numbers in perspective, the peak was reached two weeks ago at 13,748. The last lull was set just before the start of third-quarter earnings season at about 3,500.
"
1138,CF,"The number of estimate revisions tends to rise and fall with the number of earnings reports being released. As more companies provide up-to-date earnings information, brokerage analysts are more likely to revise their forecasts. Likewise, during periods when companies are relatively quiet, brokerage analysts are less likely to revise their forecasts. 
"
1139,CF,"During the past few quarters, the number of mid-quarter estimate revisions has dropped. This occurrence may be partially to blame on the uncertain pace of economic growth. CFOs may feel less confident about raising their guidance and brokerage analysts may be less likely to adjust their forecasts in the absence of company news or other data that would suggest profits could be better than anticipated. 
"
1140,CF,"Along with the drop in the number of estimates, the Zacks Revisions Ratio is likely to fall below 1.0. The revisions ratio divides the number of positive revisions (estimates being revised upwards) by the number of negative revisions (estimates being revised downward). Over the past four weeks, there have been 4,792 positive revisions and 4,795 negative revisions for the current fiscal year, which equates to a Zacks Revisions Ratio of 1.0. Obviously, numbers above 1.0 are preferred, but a slippage to .90 (or slightly lower) in September would not be cause for alarm.
"
1141,CF,"While the revisions ratio is stable for the overall Zacks Rank universe, there are pockets of weakness. Many pockets are in areas that are not unexpected, such as Building-Residential/Commercial. This group has a Zacks Revisions Ratio of just 0.14, a reflection of the ongoing slump within the industry. What is notable that is despite last months improvement in new home sales, brokerage analysts are not only cutting their forecasts for this year but are also cutting their fiscal 2008 profit projections for several homebuilders including Hovnanian , Pulte Homes (PHM  -  Free Report) and Ryland Group (RYL).
"
1142,CF,"The extent to which the problems with the housing market and the related issues with mortgages are curtailing consumer spending is not fully known. The summer has not been kind to clothing retailers, with Retail-Apparel/Shoe possessing a Zacks Revision ratio of just 0.28. As I stated last week, economic factors, the shifting of tax-free days in Texas and Florida to August, a later start to the school year in certain districts and merchandising mistakes all played a role. Just within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have lowered their full-year earnings forecasts on Bebe Stores , Casual Male (CMRG), Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and Tween Brands (TWB).
"
1143,CF,"So where is the strength? Where it has been throughout the calendar year: down on the farm. Fertilizers has a Zacks Revision Ratio of 14.0 with full-year estimates recently raised on Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) and Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report). Agricultural Operations has a Zacks Revisions Ratio of 7.0 with full-year estimates being raised on Bunge (BG  -  Free Report) and Fresh Del Monte .

1146,CF,"*A small portion of the estimates reflect FY08 earnings estimates for companies whose fiscal years end at a month other than December 2007 or January 2008.
"
1147,CF,"Back in early January, I discussed how brokerage analysts were raising their profit forecasts on fertilizer companies. Fortunately for investors, this was not just a bunch of dung. Prices of all three stocks - CF Industries Holdings (CF  -  Free Report), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA) - have risen materially, even after yesterdays market action and the volatility in late February has been factored in. 
"
1148,CF,"The good news is analysts are still raising their profit forecasts. The reason is that business conditions for agricultural-related companies are bullish. Corn acreage is likely to be at record levels this year thanks to ethanol. Cattle prices are expected to improve. Chinas rural areas are experiencing growth thanks to globalization (e.g. cashmere prices dropped because of increased imports from China). 
"
1149,CF,"Potash, CF Industries, and Agrium (AGU) are Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stocks. Terra Industries just fell back to being a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock; it was a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock yesterday. The full-year consensus estimates for all four companies are higher now than they were two months ago, a positive sign.
"
1150,CF,"Its worth noting that the fertilizer companies are not alone. CNH Global (CNH) and Deere (DE) are also Zacks #1 Rank stocks; both are are classified in Farm-Machinery, have Zacks Ranks of 1 and 2, respectively. Monsanto (MON), which is classified in Agricultural Operations, is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
1151,CF,"Yesterday, two reporters asked me about the impact the subprime lenders would have on the investment banking firms. As many of you are aware, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) delivered very strong fiscal first-quarter numbers on the same day that New Century Financial was delisted from the NYSE. (New Century Financial will start trading over-the-counter under the ticker symbol NEWC.)
"
1152,CF,"Media reports have Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar saying the impact of bad loans to subprime lenders will not be terribly meaningful. Lehman Brothers (LEH) acknowledged weakness in the mortgage market this morning, but nonetheless reported near record revenues for its fixed-income business. Firms like GS do a large amount of financing and likely have used hedges to stem the losses. It should be noted that the Mortgage Bankers Association estimated the percentage of home loans in the foreclosure process reached a record level last quarter (0.50%). Therefore the extent of the problem could partially depend on whether defaults rise among those with good credit records and/or the housing slump materially impacts other areas of the economy. A more risk-adverse environment could make it more difficult to float new debt and close mergers. 
"
1153,CF,"The prudent move for investors would be to monitor the trend in the consensus earnings estimates for investment banking firms. It is too early to judge how brokerage analysts are reacting to yesterdays report from GS or this mornings report from LEH (Lehman missed the consensus estimate by a penny with profits of $1.96 per share), though over the next several days we could see revisions for Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns (BSC).
"
1154,CF,"We are in a quiet period for earnings news. The majority of fourth-quarter reports have been published and outside of a few investment banking firms and other early reporters, first-quarter earnings season will not start for several weeks. Companies were notably tight-lipped in terms of mid- to late-quarter guidance during the second-half of last year. If recent trends continue, we should see a material decline in the number of estimate revisions throughout March and into early April.

1157,CF,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last week were: Clayton Holdings, Inc. (CLAY), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report), Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX  -  Free Report), Avici Systems Inc. (AVCI) and Texas Industries, Inc. (TXI). Clayton Holdings, Inc. (CLAY) reached a 52-week high on Feb 23 and was one of the best-performing Zacks #1 Rank stocks last week with a gain of 19.2%. For its fourth quarter, the information and analytics company announced revenues of $61.2 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 8.7% from $56.3 million. Earnings per share advanced from the previous year as well, while also eclipsing the Wall Street consensus.  
"
1158,CF,"For 2006, Claytons first year as a public company, revenues advanced 15.3% to $239.2 million from $207.5 million in 2005. Over the past month, earnings estimates for this year are up approximately 17%. Clayton Holdings serves leading capital markets firms, lending institutions, fixed income investors and loan servicers with a full suite of information-based analytics, specialty consulting and outsourced services. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) advanced 15.2% last week and hit fresh 52-week highs each day from Feb 21 through Feb 23. The company put together a solid finish to 2006 as the fall season brought increased demand in nitrogen and phosphate. Net sales for its fourth quarter reached $506.2 million, an increase of 9% from $463 million in the same period of 2005. Earnings per share moved forward on a year-over-year basis as well, due primarily to increased sales volume and improved nitrogen margins. Net sales for 2006 advanced 2% to more than $1.9 billion. Nearly all of the covering analysts adjusted their 2007 profit forecasts in response, causing the consensus estimate to soar to $2.35 per share. 
"
1159,CF,"The year 2007 is shaping up as a very good one for major segments of American agriculture, said Chairman and CEO Stephen R.
