Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada.The consumer international business has been a growth driver for the past few years, and exceeded expectations with 11.8% and 7.4% organic growth in the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively. Prior to that, the international business grew 8% in 2015 and 10% in 2016. Further, the company is opening new offices in order to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Notably, continued strength at this business, along with solid growth in Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products businesses, drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter.

Clearly, the company’s investment spending is paying off.  However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have lost 8.8% over the past six months, as against the industry’s gain of 3%.The company has been witnessing high promotional and coupon expenses, which is hurting its gross margin. Evidently, gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) and 80 bps in the third and second quarters of 2017, respectively. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin was hurt by high promotional costs, input cost inflation and unfavorable currency movements. SG&A expenses also escalated on account of higher R&D costs, which in turn weighed upon operating margin. Further, the company witnessed higher marketing costs to support innovations and expects similar trends in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs should keep driving its performance. In addition, continued strength in the Consumer International unit, along with growth across other segments, keeps us encouraged.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

17,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report)) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading manufacturer and marketer of personal care, household and specialty products will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been delivering positive earnings surprise for three straight quarters now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 47 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period figure. Further, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $937 million, up roughly 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayA look at Church & Dwight’s past performance reveals that out of the past 13 quarters, the company’s bottom line has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 quarters, while the top line has surpassed the same 11 times. The impressive past performance can be attributed to Church & Dwight’s solid brand portfolio, along with focus on acquisitions and innovations. Evidently, in the last quarter, sales grew 2.3% on the back of acquisitions. Organic sales climbed 1.8% as higher volumes were largely offset by higher promotional investments, which continues to be a hurdle. While shares of the company have gained 3.8% so far this year, it has underperformed the industry’s jump of 16.3%.Higher Promotional Costs & Pricing Pressure May Dent MarginsSegment-wise, the company witnessed strong organic sales growth at Consumer International and Specialty Products units, while growth at the Consumer Domestic unit decelerated from the previous quarter. Moreover, increased promotion and coupon investments in the domestic business dented the company’s gross margin, which also weighed upon earnings. Further, the company expects higher marketing spending in support of new product launches and increased promotional spending to squeeze gross margins in the third quarter. Also, Church & Dwight continues to expect modest inflationary environment. These factors, along with pricing pressure, stiff competition and weak demand in many of its markets remain headwinds for the company.Contributions From Buyouts to Aid Top Line, Q3 ForecastsNonetheless, management remains confident of its performance, thanks to its stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, aggressive productivity programs and tight expense management. All said, in third-quarter 2017, the company expects reported and organic sales growth of 3.5%. Organic sales at the domestic unit is estimated to rise 3 %. Further, Church & Dwight envisions adjusted earnings of 46 cents in the quarter, including 2 cents of net dilution from Water Pik acquisition costs.As the domestic segment contributes a major chunk to Church & Dwight’s total revenues, let’s look at the third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment. The revenue consensus estimate for the Consumer Domestic segment is pegged at $710 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.8%. The consensus mark for Consumer International and Specialty Products segments are pegged at $147 million and $76 million, representing year-over-year growth of 9.7% and 5.6% respectively.  What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Church & Dwightis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In fact, its leadership brands like Braun, PUR, Honeywell, OXO, Vicks, Hydro Flask and Hot Tools are gaining traction in various markets.Also, Helen of Troy is exploring new opportunities for additional investments in product enhancement, expanding its footprint, digital marketing as well as e-commerce growth.However, the company is facing a tough retail landscape including sluggish brick-and-mortar business. Furthermore, it is facing intense competition in the personal care category, and is also being impacted by changing consumer preferences. In addition, Helen of Troy is witnessing sluggishness in its Nutritional Supplements and Beauty segments.Evidently, these factors hurt the company’s top line that has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last five quarters.Nevertheless, it is to be seen whether Helen of Troy is able to keep its positive earnings streak alive in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

19,CHD,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) continues to progress well with its savings programs along with a disciplined capital strategy and other initiatives. However, the company has a dismal sales trend.Savings Programs Bode WellColgate remains committed to its savings programs as both Global Growth and Efficiency Program (or 2012 Restructuring Program) as well as Funding the Growth initiatives are delivering impressive results.Furthermore, the company stated that the additional savings opportunities identified under the program in the second quarter of 2017 provide visibility to reach the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. Consequently, the company expects both GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.Markedly, this four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share position worldwide.Meanwhile, through funding growth initiative the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers while reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are anticipated to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Other CatalystsColgate commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. In fact, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles of the company’s growth strategy over the years, thus enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. Management further expects to grow market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Going forward, the company remains focused on four fundamentals to boost profits including, increased spending on more impactful advertisements, innovation across portfolio of businesses, higher spends on high growth e-commerce business and aggressively maximizing productivity.Additionally, Colgate has always followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This strategy focuses on making investments to develop business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks owing to its strong cash generation ability.Stellar Earnings TrendColgate, which shares space with Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, the company has posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.ConcernsColgate has a dismal sales trend as its top line has lagged estimates in 16 of the trailing 17 quarters. In fact, the company’s second-quarter results marked its fifth straight sales miss. Sales in the quarter were hurt by the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, low global unit volumes and negative currency fluctuations were deterrents.Management anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide in the near term.Bottom LineWhile the soft sales trends indicate weakness, we remain confident of the company’s growth prospects, given its innovation track record and ongoing initiatives. We believe the company’s actions will help counter the dismal sales trends. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

20,CHD,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in 13 out of the last 15 quarters, with an average beat of 4.4% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the third-quarter results.                     Estimate Revisions The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the last 30 days at $1.05, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 1.7%. However, estimates for fiscal 2017 have increased by a cent to reach $4.09, reflecting growth of 8.3% from the prior-year period.Further, analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1.15 billion for the third quarter, up 5% from the prior-year period. Revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $4.8 billion, displaying an increase rise of 7.9% from the previous year.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.McCormick has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.05. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at Play McCormick’s strategic focus on acquisitions has been aiding the company to boost top line for quite a while now. It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The acquisition is anticipated to generate cost synergies of approximately $50 million, expected to be achieved by 2020, with significant margin and earnings accretion in 2017. Moreover, the buyout is expected to position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U.S. condiments category. In the past, the company has made several acquisitions including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (both carried out in 2016).Additionally, the company has been focusing on innovation and brand marketing to enhance portfolio and revenue opportunities. McCormick has also remained dedicated toward its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program, which aids cost reduction. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $109 million in 2016, up from $98 million in 2015. Further, it expects to deliver cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019.Nevertheless, McCormick has been battling with increased input costs since the past many quarters. Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, thereby affecting margins. For fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. Further, the company’s sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors. Moreover, its business in the U.K. has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to gain space for general merchandise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.                                   Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.45 and carries a Zacks Rank #3Church & Dwight Company Inc (CHD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.26% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

Moreover, the company’s Specialty Products business has been underperforming of late. Sales at this segment witnessed a year-over-year decline in all the four quarters of 2016. However, the same showed a slight increase in first-quarter 2017 due to lower volumes in the specialty chemical sector of the business. Encouragingly, the animal productivity business improved in both price and volume due to higher demand from the U.S. dairy industry as milk prices and dairy farm profitability seem to have stabilized. Further, management remains on track to revive this division’s performance to boost overall profitability.Though the company expects rising commodity costs and foreign currency headwinds to prevail in 2017, the recent acquisitions of Agro BioSciences, VIVISCAL business and ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands are expected to add further strength to the company’s sturdy portfolio and improve business.For the second quarter, the company expects reported and organic sales growth of approximately 1 to 2%.

While the acquisition of the Miller global brands helped improving sales in the International regions, sales volume continued to decline in Canada and Europe. A difficult economy, unfavorable currency and competitive pressure remained the major deterrents. The company’s dismal performance is reflected in its share price. Molson Coors’ shares have fallen 12.3% in the last one year, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 2.4%. In order to revive its performance, Molson Coors has been focusing on expanding its foothold through strategic agreements and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.The recent agreement with Hornell Brewing Co., Inc., an affiliate of AriZona Beverages, is in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives. The deal will give Molson Coors the license to market and distribute a new Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB) brand, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half, through its U.S. division MillerCoors. This would aid Molson Coors to capture the momentum of ready-to-drink teas (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in the U.S.In regard to its cost savings target, the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions. The acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in MillerCoors will also drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. This will also help the company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead.

26,CHD,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its long-term initiatives, solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, strong brand portfolio and a disciplined capital strategy.Let’s find out more about the stock, which also boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.2020 StrategyClorox remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In fact, the whole strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3−5%, improvement of EBIT margin by 25−50 basis points, and generating free cash flow of 10−12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.We note that the company is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of eCommerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds – desire, decision and delight.Sturdy Q4 Results & Favorable OutlookClorox posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. Notably, earnings marked the third straight quarter of a beat, while sales reverted to its positive surprise track after a miss in the last quarter.While the bottom line gained from strong sales and cost-savings, the top line was fueled by higher volumes, better International pricing and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016). Further, sales grew year over year in each segment in the quarter. The company’s fiscal 2017 performance also remained robust with solid top- and bottom-line growth year over year. (Read More: Clorox Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat the Zacks Consensus)Further, management is encouraged by its International operations, and expects pricing and cost savings to continue driving results. It expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth. For fiscal 2018, Clorox expects sales to grow in a range of 2–4%, and earnings from continuing operations to rise 3–7% year over year.Other StrengthsWe believe Clorox's diversified brand portfolio places the company well above its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain itself in the currently challenging environment.In fact, its focus on boosting sales through brands is well-evident from its constant innovations and marketing strategies to drive top-line growth. Alongside, it maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy, making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to lower debts and enhance shareholder returns.Concerns/WeaknessHowever, the stock is not devoid of concerns/headwinds, which might dampen its performance in the near term. Clorox’s significant international presence exposes it to major foreign currency risks (especially in Argentina), which have hurt results for a while in the past. Also, currency headwinds are expected to have one point adverse impact on sales growth in fiscal 2018.Additionally, Clorox faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Bottom LineWhile these headwinds, along with a retail landscape that is expected to be more competitive in fiscal 2018, the company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued investments in innovating products and brands, will help drive results.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

However, sales growth in Consumer Domestic segment was dented by decline in Personal Care Products category.

28,CHD,"Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report) is all set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading consumer products company will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.6% in the fiscal second quarter. However, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Spectrum Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. QuoteSpectrum Brands has an Earnings ESP of -1.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.89, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.92. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.What to Expect?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 and $5.82 for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017, respectively, has declined by two cents each in the last seven days.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.38 billion and $5.08 billion for the said quarter and the fiscal year, respectively.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the Consumer Staples sector looks decent. While total earnings for the sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Factors Influencing the QuarterSpectrum Brands’ shares have declined 14% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s loss of 3.1%. In contrast, the Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector gained 2% and is currently placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).We note that the company’s top line has lagged estimates in four of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. Moreover, its sales have been declining since the last three quarters, primarily due to soft sales recorded at the Global Batteries & Appliances, Global Pet Supplies and Global Auto Care segments. In fact, sales decreased 3.3% and 0.6% in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. The same had slumped 4.5% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016.Further, Spectrum Brands continues to battle adverse foreign currency effects, which is likely to mar its results in the near term. Management expects net sales for fiscal 2017 to include about 100–150 basis points impact from currency headwinds.However, on the positive front, we remain encouraged by the company’s innovative products in all categories and persistent leverage of its global infrastructure and shared services. Also, it is making acquisitions and exiting underperforming businesses to improve profitability, margins and free cash flow. So let’s wait and see if Spectrum Brands can counter the hurdles and be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarter with these initiatives.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

29,CHD,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.13%.In fact, despite sales remaining subdued, the consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling for the last few years to boost sales. Notably, the company’s sales declined in the last 13 consecutive quarters. Major foreign exchange headwind, weak volumes, divestitures and slowing market growth have been hurting the company’s sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets also adds to the worries.The trend is not likely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the U.S. and volatility in developing markets will likely have an adverse impact on Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and profitable market, the U.S. (accounting for 40% of net sales), grew by less than a point in the fiscal third quarter, a lot lower than the roughly 2% growth registered in the first half of fiscal 2017. Overall, the company posted flat organic sales growth in developed markets.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales. However, fiscal third quarter’s gross as well as operating margins fell despite benefitting from productivity savings. This was due to higher input costs, a planned increase in marketing spending, higher R&D costs, and lower pricing due to increased competition.Hence, lower sales accompanied by higher commodity costs, more investments for marketing and increased R&D spending to push demand might adversely affect margins, thereby putting pressure on bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. This will be partly offset by cost-saving measures.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 78 cents, reflecting a decrease of 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $15.98 billion, implying a 0.8% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Procter & Gamble is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Procter & Gamble’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 78 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few consumer staples companies that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.

30,CHD,"Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 3% from 70 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.  Including one-time items, earnings came in at 59 cents a share compared with 67 cents reported in the year-ago period.Despite earnings beat, Colgate’s shares are down 2.3% during pre-market trading hours, as investors remained skeptical about the company’s top-line performance that fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter. In fact in the last three months, the stock has declined 2.1% compared with the broader industry’s growth of 2.9%.Deeper InsightTotal sales of $3,826 million dipped 0.5% from the year-ago period and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,885 million. The benefits of 1% increase in prices were offset by a 1% drop in global unit volumes and a negative impact of 0.5% from currency fluctuations.On an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales were flat with last year. The flat results were due to the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. This was considerably mitigated by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill’s Pet Nutrition.Adjusted gross profit margin was 60.7%, up 50 basis points (bps), driven by benefits of cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program, along with better pricing. These were partly neutralized by increased raw and packaging material expenses, including currency exchange transactions costs.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $995 million dipped 1%, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 10 bps to 26% on 40 bps increase in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, offset by improved gross margin.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.8%. Further, the company continued to lead with market share in the global toothpaste with a gain of 43.6% year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (20% of total sales) fell 3.5%, reflecting a 2% drop in unit volume and 1.5% decline in pricing. However, currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.5% on account of market share losses in the dish liquid business and increased slowdown in category growth, both in the U.S.Latin America net sales (26% of total sales) jumped 7% year over year gaining from 4.5% increase in pricing and 2.5% volume gains, while currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. Volume growth can mainly be attributed to increase in Brazil, the Andean region and Argentina. On an organic basis, sales increased 7%.Europe net sales (15% of total sales) slipped 3.5% year over year, due to 1% decline in unit volumes and negative impact of 3% from currency fluctuations, partially offset by 0.5% increase in pricing. Unit volumes were hurt by declines in Germany and Norway, offsetting gains in the Netherlands, U.K. and Poland. Europe organic sales dipped 0.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (18% of total sales) declined 5%, attributable to 2% decline in unit volume and 1.5% fall in pricing and 1.5% negative impact from currency fluctuations. Unit volumes declines in India, Thailand and Australia were partly offset by gains in the Philippines, Vietnam and New Zealand. On an organic basis, sales for Asia Pacific decreased 3.5% due to the inventory reductions by wholesalers in India in anticipation of the new Goods and Services Tax that went into effect on Jul 1, 2017. Additionally, increased competition related activities in Australia and lower consumptions in Thailand acted as headwinds.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) inched up 1% year over year, fueled by 4.5% jump in pricing and positive currency effects of 4%, partly offset by 7.5% drop in unit volumes. Volume declines in the Sub Saharan Africa region, Turkey and South Africa were partly offset by gains in Russia. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 3%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were flat with the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, positive impact from 2% increase in pricing was neutralized by 1.5% decline in volumes and 0.5% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume declines in the U.S., Japan and Canada were slightly countered by gains in Russia, Latin America and South Africa. On an organic basis, sales rose 0.5%.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteOther Financial DetailsColgate ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,241 million and total debt of $6,519 million. Net cash provided by operating activities came in at $1,305 million for the six months ended Jun 30, 2017.OutlookLooking forward, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. Consequently, the company reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth. However, on account of the soft first half 2017, management now envisions organic sales growth for 2017 to be in the low-single digit range, compared with the previous forecast of moderately below 4–7% range.Nevertheless, the company remains encouraged by the progress on its 2012 Restructuring Program and continues to pursue additional savings opportunities under the program. In this regard, the company stated that the additional opportunities identified in the second-quarter provide visibility for reaching the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range.Consequently, on a GAAP basis, management forecasts gross margin expansion for the year. Further, it expects GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and the other 2016 one-time items, Colgate continues to project low-single-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis for 2017. Further, the company anticipates robust operating cash flows, gross margin expansion and rise in advertising investment for the year.Zacks Rank & Key PicksColgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, management believes that the company is well placed to achieve adjusted operating income improvement in the higher end of its targeted range of $600-$650 million.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned growth drivers, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin since the past three quarters, thanks to higher inbound freight costs. Driver availability challenges in the industry have led to increase in freight costs. Further, during the third quarter, the company’s U.S. Broadline operations were hurt by food cost inflation, while rising prices stemming from product costs and currency translations in the U.K. marred international segment performance. Persistence of such headwinds continues to be a threat to Sysco’s performance in the forthcoming periods. Notably, other consumer staples companies such as McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) have also been struggling with higher commodity costs.On the bright side, we are impressed with Sysco’s acquisition and efficiency boosting strategies that have been yielding favorably. In fact, such aspects have raised investors’ optimism on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, evident from its 16.4% rally in a year, while the industry fell 16%. Moreover, we are hopeful that Sysco’s cost-management strategies will offset the negative impacts stemming from cost-related hurdles in the forthcoming periods. With such positives embedded, Sysco is likely to continue in investors good books.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

32,CHD,"The Boston Beer Company Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) witnessed significant momentum since reporting solid first-quarter 2017 earnings on Apr 25, 2018. The company’s upside story relates to continued progress on its strategic initiatives. We remain encouraged by Boston Beer’s three-point growth plan, focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands.Stock SurgesShares of Boston Beer have increased 6.8% in the past month against the industry’s decline of 6.3%. However, the stock has witnessed growth of 9.4% after reporting solid results on Apr 25 while the industry declined 4%.Boston Beer delivered earnings and sales beat in first-quarter 2018, marking its fifth earnings beat in the last six quarters and the third positive sales surprise in the trailing four quarters. Bottom line gained from solid revenue growth as well as higher gross margin, somewhat negated by rise in advertising, promotion and selling expenses. Results gained from gross-margin improvement, lower operating costs, owing to the company’s cost-saving initiatives, as well as lower tax rate. Meanwhile, sales benefited from improved shipment volumes and depletions.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteLet’s find out more about the growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Strategic Initiatives ImpressThe company remains committed to the three-point growth plan, focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. Firstly, it plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand-communication initiatives. Further, it remains keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea’s momentum while ensuring Truly Spiked & Sparkling's leadership position in the hard sparkling-water category. Efforts to improve trends at Samuel Adams comprise its integrated 'Fill Your Glass' marketing campaign alongside sales execution of its Samuel Adams initiative, Sam ’76. Additionally, the company is focused on making more investments in Angry Orchard media in the second quarter.Secondly, the company accelerated its focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with these savings directed for further brand development. Based on current opportunities, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019. The company’s third priority is long-term innovation and maximizing the shareholder value. Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories.Improving Depletion TrendsBoston Beer’s top-line gains in the first quarter were driven by 15% improvement in shipment volumes and 8% depletions growth. In the reported quarter, depletion primarily gained from increases in Twisted Tea, Truly Spiked & Sparkling, and Angry Orchard brands, partially offset by the fall in the Samuel Adams brand. Depletions for the year-to-date period through the 15-weeks period, ended Apr 14, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 8% from the comparable year-ago period. For 2018, depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6%.Cost Savings Aid Gross MarginsBoston Beer is making strides to address industry challenges through improved cost structure and re-investing these savings for brand development. This has been significantly contributing toward improving gross margin. In 2017, the company’s cost savings and efficiency projects delivered above the targeted ranges, providing increased flexibility to invest in brands. This positions the company well for 2018. Gross margin improved 330 basis points (bps) in the first quarter, driven by better pricing, product and package mix, and favorable fixed-cost absorption along with cost-savings gains from the company-owned breweries. For 2018, the company expects gross margins between 52% and 54%, driven by continued progress on cost-saving initiatives.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

33,CHD,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) has been sailing in troubled waters, thanks to the prolonged struggle with rising commodity costs, lower selling prices and increased competition in the diaper segment. These factors have weighed on the company’s shares that have declined 9.4% in the past three months against the industry’s fall of 8.8%.Rising Commodity Costs Higher input costs have been troubling Kimberly-Clark’s performance for a while. Evidently, commodity cost inflation of $175 million, stemming from greater costs of pulp and other raw materials, caused the company’s adjusted operating profit to fall 3% in the first quarter of 2018. Such factors have also been a drag on the gross margin, which contracted roughly 890 basis points (bps) to 28% in first-quarter 2018.Prior to this, gross margin witnessed year-over-year declines of 200 bps, 60 bps and 10 bps in the preceding three quarters, respectively. To make matters worse, management anticipates input cost inflation of about $400-$550 million for 2018. We expect that such aspects will persistently dampen profits.Apart from Kimberly-Clark, other consumer staples companies such as McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) have also been struggling with higher commodity costs, which has been marring their profitability.Lower Net PricesLower selling prices are another hurdle faced by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, this trend lingered and affected results in most segments. Evidently, lower net selling prices dragged sales and operating profits of Kimberly-Clark’s Personal Care as well as K-C Professional (KCP) divisions. Moreover, such deterrents limit the company’s ability to fend-off negative impacts stemming from rising commodity costs. Prolonged Weakness in the Diaper SegmentKimberly-Clark’s diaper segment, that holds a vital place in the Personal Care category, has been bearing the brunt of increased competition across several markets. The segment remains particularly challenged in South Korea, due to lower birth rates. The bleak performance of the diaper unit also puts the company’s market share at risk.Any Rays of Hope Ahead?Considering the constant struggle with rising commodity costs, it only seems natural for Kimberly-Clark to undertake aggressive measures to cut costs. The company’s Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program has generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017. In the first quarter, Kimberly-Clark generated savings of $90 million from this program and projects cost savings of $400 million in 2018.The company estimates more than $1.5 billion to be generated over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. These savings are expected to be achieved through management’s focus on enhancing productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses and attaining distribution efficiencies.Speaking of building efficiencies, Kimberly-Clark’s recently embarked 2018 Global Restructuring Program deserves special mention. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, enable it to compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. On a combined basis, the company expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years.While Kimberly-Clark’s savings efforts seem quite robust, they are yet to fully offset the negative impacts from the aforementioned hurdles. That said, let’s wait and see if such initiatives yield favorable impacts in the forthcoming periods and lift investors’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

In addition, the top line comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,593 million.Revenues from U.S. operations came in at $1,841.1 million, up 6% year over year. The upside came on the back of the company’s case-ready and small bird businesses’ stellar performance.Mexican operations generated revenues of $361.3 million in the reported quarter, up 27.2% year over year. The upside was driven by robust demand for both Pilgrim’s Pride’s and Del Dia branded chicken products.Top-line results from the company’s European operations also improved 18.6% year over year to $544.3 million. Successful integration activities of Moy Park buyout (closed in September 2017) primarily boosted Pilgrim's Pride’s European sales. Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pilgrim's Pride Corporation Quote Costs/MarginsCost of sales in the reported quarter flared up 10.6% year over year to $2,459 million. However, gross margin expanded by 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 10.5%, on the back of strong top-line performance.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 5% year over year to $85.3 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin came in at 9.9%, expanding 70 bps year over year.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowPilgrim's Pride exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $580.8 million, slightly down from $581.5 million recorded on Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt (net of current portion) was $2,625.7 million, as against $2,635.6 million recorded in 2017-end.In the reported quarter, the company provided $0.64 million of cash from its operating activities, in contract of $66.3 million cash secured in the year-ago quarter.  Capital spending totaled $76.7 million compared to $121.6 million incurred in the prior-year quarter.OutlookPilgrim's Pride is poised to grow on the back of its latest acquisitions and recent investments. The company perceives that efficacious integration of Moy Park business and increased operational efficacy will boost its profitability going forward.Zacks RankPilgrim's Pride currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Rising costs, if unchecked, can dampen the company’s profitability in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, the company continues to face supply side challenges relating to labor constraints as well as feed and logistic issues.

The upside was backed by a 4.2% rise in global consumer products growth. This in turn was fueled by higher volumes (up 4.7%), somewhat negated by unfavorable product mix and pricing.Adjusted gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 44.9% due to increased commodity and transportation expenses. Further, marketing costs (as a percentage of sales) escalated 20 bps to 10.5%, excluding buyouts. SG&A costs also rose 30 bps as a percentage of sales to 13.1%, mainly due to buyouts.Segment DetailsConsumer Domestic: Segment net sales were up 13.9% to $751.4 million, courtesy of gains from acquisitions and higher household and personal care sales.

37,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its international consumer sales unit that has been performing well for quite some time. Also, strategic acquisitions have been contributing to the company’s top line. These factors along with focus on innovations and continued organic sales growth seem to be boosting investors’ confidence.Markedly, Church & Dwight has gained 9.6% in the past three months, against the industry’s decline of 1.6%. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock scaled a 52-week high of $55.05 on Jul 13, though it closed a tad lower at $54.9.What’s Behind the Rally?Church & Dwight has been consistently gaining from strength at its International Consumer unit. In first-quarter 2018, organic sales in the international segment jumped 6.8%, driven by higher volumes, and improved pricing and mix.The company’s overall international sales surged 26.3%, receiving considerable impetus from OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia. Additionally, the company is opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong. Also, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which are likely to be major growth drivers in the future.Also, Church & Dwight has been witnessing organic sales growth for quite some time now, backed by its solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales grew 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018 following increases of 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the first quarter of 2018, organic sales growth was driven by a 4.2% rise in global consumer products’ growth, which, in turn, was fueled by higher volumes. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow more than 3%.Furthermore, the company is actively pursuing strategic acquisitions that has been boosting its revenues, which are expected to reach $4 billion in 2018. In this regard, Church & Dwight recently acquired Waterpik, which contributed significantly to its sales in the first quarter.

High commodity and transportation expenses, and unfavorable brand mix remain threats to margins.Nevertheless, we expect the company’s aforementioned upsides to offset these hurdles and help it continue with its stellar show.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

42,CHD,"Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company delivered organic sales growth of 2.9% (in local currency).A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying for the last six months. Shares have rallied 37.4% over the said time frame, outperforming the Zacks categorized Soap & Cleaning Materials industry’s 13.1% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 3% of the Zacks Classified industries (7 out of the 256).Unilever currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and we believe there is much value in the stock which is quite evident from its VGM Score of ‘B’.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What’s Driving the Stock?The Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.The consumer products giant is divesting its underperforming businesses and has reportedly decided to sell its unprofitable spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter, in April. Furthermore, the company announced that it would buyback shares, hike dividends, raise cost savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Unilever has also undertaken a program called Connected 4 Growth to reduce costs, under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over. The company is also consistently focusing on product improvement through innovation. Moreover, it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA, which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders.Notably, Unilever has entered into many deals to fortify its position in home care and personal care products. These acquisitions will strengthen its portfolio and generate substantial revenues. Unilever is reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to buy the foods division of British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser.Meanwhile, the company continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil. Further, it is witnessing softness in the developed markets in North America and Europe with little sign of recovery. Nevertheless, the company remains focused on boosting sales in the emerging markets which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. Though these markets are generally volatile, they offer robust long-term prospect.Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever NV QuoteStocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

43,CHD,"Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. The manufacturer of comfort fabric apparel has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. However, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what’s in store for Delta Apparel this time around.What to ExpectThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 27 cents, which shows a 42.6% slump from 47 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $100 million, down 3.8% from the year-ago period reported figure. Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Apparel, Inc. Quote Factors Driving the QuarterDelta Apparel is likely to gain from its robust endeavors aimed at rationalizing business, enhancing operational efficacies and implementing marketing initiatives. These strategies, along with solid consumer demand helped the company deliver strong results in the last reported quarter. Further, management remains encouraged about expansion plans of Art Gun, Salt Life as well as Soffe. Art Gun’s focus on solidifying geographic reach, Salt Life’s strength across retail stores and e-commerce, and Soffe’s efforts to curtail costs and improve performance are likely to fuel Delta Apparel’s performance. All these factors bode well for the quarter to be reported.However, we remain cautious about the tough retail environment, that may weigh on sales and margins. Further, the company divested its Junkfood business toward the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which may hurt year-over-year comparisons this time. Apart from this, we remain apprehensive about higher raw material costs that weighed on the company’s gross margin in the last reported quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Delta Apparel is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CHD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.52% heading into earnings season.Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

45,CHD,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. This provider of food and related products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.1% in the trailing four quarters, with a beat in each quarter. Let’s see if Sysco can keep this positive streak alive this time around as well.Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote U.S. Food Service Unit & Strategy for 2020: Major DriversWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from strength at its U.S. Foodservice segment as well as its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. These factors and solid cost-savings efforts helped the company retain its robust past record in the last reported quarter. Notably, Sysco’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its fourth straight quarter of sales beat, whereas earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the past nine straight quarters. Results in the quarter were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, wherein restaurant sales continued to grow and compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters. Management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment.In the third quarter analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from U.S. Foodservice and International units to grow 5.7% and 8.3% to $9,761 million and $2,739 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at $14,382 million, up from $13,524 million recorded in the year-ago period.Apart from this, we also remain encouraged about Sysco’s focus on its strategy for 2020, as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. This is evident from the recent launch of its redesigned website, which is aimed at enhancing consumers overall experience. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Further, we commend Sysco’s focus on acquisitions, which are expected to drive sales and also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Will Cost Hurdles be Offset?However, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past two quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company continued to bear the brunt of higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry. Segment-wise, the U.S. Broadline unit gross margin was marred by food cost inflation of 3.3%, owing to categories like meat, dairy and produce. The International segment was hurt by food cost inflation in the U.K., driven by higher product costs and currency movements.Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby hurting volumes and margins. Further, adjusted operating income for the International segment tanked 28.8% to $79 million. Persistence of these hurdles remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Nevertheless, we expect Sysco’s robust cost-saving initiatives and other growth endeavors to help offset these hurdles in the to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel the bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver a solid third quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents, which marks a solid 25.5% improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

46,CHD,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell. The company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.3%.So, let’s delve deep into the factors to see how Newell is doing before its first-quarter earnings release.Factors at PlayNewell has been struggling with strained margins for the last few quarters. Lower core sales, absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and, higher advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment have been denting the company’s margins. These factors might hurt overall profitability in the first quarter, apprehending which investors’ sentiments have taken a hit. Consequently, shares of the company have plunged 32% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 14.6%.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteThough the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents for the first quarter of 2018 remained stable in the last 30 days, it portrays a year-over-year decline of 20.6%. Also, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $3.04 billion for the quarter, down 6.8% from the year-ago period.Furthermore, the consensus estimates of $1,051 million, $523 million and $551 million for Live, Learn and Work segments, respectively, reflect a decline of 39%, 5.1% and 21.8% sequentially. However, the consensus mark of $633 million for the Play segment shows an increase of 12.4% from fourth-quarter 2017.While the company has been witnessing margin issues, Newell remains on track with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans. Further, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in the industrial and commercial products as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. On completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company with leading consumer-facing brands, impressive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.Furthermore, Newell’s Project Renewal Program continues to focus on saving costs in the areas of procurement by reducing the complexity of its business and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes, through further overhead reduction. In addition, it intends to use a major portion of the savings in accelerating growth by investing the same in business, while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. These savings are also expected to boost margins, cash flow and further investments.All said, we remain cautious about Newell’s performance in the upcoming quarter, however, the company is poised well for growth in the long term.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Newell is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter.

47,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This consumer goods behemoth has surpassed earnings estimates for five consecutive quarters now, courtesy of its robust international presence, solid organic sales trend and focus on buyouts. However, the company is plagued by escalated expenses, which remain a threat to margins. So, let’s see if Church & Dwight can keep its splendid surprise streak alive this time around as well. Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Quote International Business: A Major StrengthWe expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its international business, which has been a growth driver over the past few years. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8%, courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Well, international sales have also been contributing strongly to the company’s organic sales growth. Thus, the company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth, as evident from its considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China. Also, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business and expects its international operations to remain strong,Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Consumer International to surge 20.3% to $172 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products segments are pegged at $728 million and $78 million, respectively, in comparison with $660 million and $74 million reported in the year-ago period.Other DriversChurch & Dwight is also likely to continue witnessing organic sales growth, which has long been backed by the company’s solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which also gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company expects organic sales growth of 2%.Apart from these factors, Church & Dwight has been benefiting from its focus on acquisitions. The company started with only one brand, i.e. ARM & HAMMER and since then has acquired a number of brands which are generally number-one or number-two brands with high margin. These businesses are likely to have boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is on track with its integration.Considering all aforementioned factors, management projects first-quarter reported sales growth to be 11% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $979 million, up 11.6% from $877 million recorded in the year-ago period.Will Cost Woes be Offset?However, Church & Dwight continues to battle increased commodity and transportation costs. Management expects these headwinds to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Further, the company plans to increase marketing expenditure, while it also expects SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales) to increase, owing to intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions. This may impact the operating margin.Nevertheless, it looks like the company expects strength of its international business and revenue-driving initiatives to compensate for these obstacles, as it envisions adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.3% (on an adjusted basis). This also falls in line with the Zacks consensus estimate that has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Church & Dwight carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with its Earnings ESP of +0.52%, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +11.31%.

48,CHD,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

49,CHD,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2. The company has an impressive earnings history, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the past five quarters.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the company’s earnings announcement. The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteFactors at PlayWe note that Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue in the forthcoming period. Margin was strained due to escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments for growth and cost savings initiatives, which might continue to increase expenses and hurt profitability in the quarter to be reported. Meanwhile, intense competition from well-established players in the consumer products industry remains a cause for concern.In the past three months, shares of Clorox have lost 17.5%, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.6%.However, Clorox remains committed toward brand management and improvement in margins through cost saving and productivity initiatives. Also, it makes strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities both in the physical world and online. Recently, management has agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. The deal is expected to expand Clorox's dietary supplements business, thereby accelerating growth of its top brands in the fast-growing categories, alongside focusing on health and wellness. Additionally, it remains well on track with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share.These tailwinds might contribute to the company’s top line and boost profitability. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues to come in at $1.51 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.In the light of these above-mentioned factors, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Clorox in third-quarter fiscal 2018.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.94% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat in the ensuing quarter.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #3.

50,CHD,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), on May 28. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but flaunts an attractive VGM Score of A. Strong demand for on-trend branded products is supporting the company’s growth, however, prevalent turkey market challenges remains a headwind.Let’s dig deeper into the basic fundamental factors affecting the stock.Factors Favoring the StockImproving demand for popular brands like Hormel Black Label bacon, SPAM, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips is currently driving Hormel Foods revenues. Moreover, the company expects that the Make the Switch campaign this summer will bolster sales of its value-added businesses in the second half of fiscal 2018.The company also intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. Successful integration of the Fontanini and Columbus buyouts are expected to strengthen Hormel Foods’ business portfolio, going forward.Hormel Foods has been boosting its liquidity on the back of reduced corporate tax rates. In first-half fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flows of $443 million, up 58% from the year-ago period, on grounds of lower taxes. Notably, Hormel Foods narrowed its fiscal 2018 tax rate to 17.5-19.5%, from the prior fiscal’s 33.2%, and anticipates to generate cash flow benefit of $100-$140 million in the current fiscal. The company intends to finance its new marketing and capital investment projects with these proceeds.Over the last three months, Hormel Foods shares have rallied 10.8%, as against the 2.1% loss recorded by the industry.Existing SetbacksTurkey market challenges have been hurting revenues and profitability of Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment for the past few quarters. The company noted that a supply glut has been affecting the prices of turkey and cold storage meat. Notably, soaring freight expenses and elevated advertising costs also weighed over the segment’s bottom line in second-quarter fiscal 2018. The company stated that surge in fuel prices and scarcity of trucks will continue to escalate freight costs until fiscal 2019.Hormel Foods’ margins are also vulnerable to input price fluctuations. For instance, inflation in the prices of pork bellies and beef trim marred the company’s profitability in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, volatilities in the prices of beef, hog and hog sport trim pulled down its margins in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In the fiscal second quarter, Hormel Foods experienced inflation in beef prices and anticipates the same to persist through the remaining of the current fiscal. Moreover, uncertain impact of tariffs on the pork industry remains a major cause of concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are listed below:B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 0.68% in the past four quarters.

The company came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.17% over the trailing four quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

51,CHD,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7, before the opening bell. Rising demand for protein-rich products has been favoring Tyson Foods’ performance. Positive synergies from buyouts and cost-saving efforts have also been fueling the company’s growth.However, we note that Tyson Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly release.Factors Impacting Q2Rising demand for protein and meat products has been an aspect of cheer for Tyson Foods for a while. This is evident from the fact that sales volumes across the Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, management expects demand for protein to continue to rise and is well placed to exploit opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.Such a positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments and cater to consumers’ demand efficiently. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples. It has also been bolstering its poultry production capacity in Tennessee and other regions. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Buyouts Add Strength to PortfolioTyson Foods’ prepared food segment is expected to benefit from the positive synergies of the AdvancePierre buyout. Through this acquisition, management has been trying to expand fresh food offerings along with bolstering protein brands portfolio. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects incremental sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre in fiscal 2018. Also, the company is on track to integrate Original Philly Holdings (acquired in November 2017) within its Prepared Foods segment.Driven by such positives, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales across Beef, Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments to rise 6%, 6.1%, 2% and 17.3%, respectively, in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the impeding quarter is expected at $9,954 million, depicting a rise of almost 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteEnhancing Operational EfficiencyToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, which is expected to enhance operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line in the forthcoming periods. These efforts are expected to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018, which bode well for the upcoming quarterly release. Notably, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter, which boosted the bottom line.We expect that the aforementioned factors will significantly aid the company’s bottom-line performance during the second quarter. Evidently, the consensus mark for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $1.37, depicting a surge of 35.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. However, the projection has gone down by four cents over the last 30 days, perhaps due to the the apprehensions stemming from the recently raised tariff rates on pork by China. Escalating labor and freight expenses are also a hurdle for the company, which may impede the bottom line.Wrapping it up, lets take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the impending quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

52,CHD,"The Q4 earnings season is in full swing, with more than 250 companies, including 81 S&P 500 members, releasing quarterly results this week. Moreover, the earnings picture so far has been encouraging. Per the latest Earnings Outlook released on Jan 19, 53 S&P 500 members have already released quarterly results. Earnings of these companies increased 11.7% and revenues rose 7.5%.The Zacks Consumer Staples sector is yet to witness major releases. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, Consumer Staples is among the top 44%. Per the Earnings Outlook, the sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 4.6% and revenue increase of 2.6% this earnings season.The sector seems to be faring well, courtesy of rising consumer optimism, which received boost from an improving economy. Also, efforts such as focus on innovations, strategic buyouts and product launches are likely to drive players in this space. Additionally, aggressive cost-saving initiatives and attempts to keep pace with changing consumer patterns bode well for the stocks in the space.Such endeavors seem appropriate considering the heightened competition, price wars, input cost inflation and promotional environment. Notably, the Consumer Staples sector has gained 11.8% in a year, whereas the S&P 500 market rallied 23.7%.Let’s see what awaits McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), which is set for earnings release on Jan 25.Per our research, stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP are likely to post a positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .What to Expect from McCormick This EarningsMcCormick is a leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products. The company is poised to beat earnings this season, as it now has an Earnings ESP of +0.49% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s look into some of the factors which are likely to impact McCormick’s performance this season.Acquisitions & Costs Saving Efforts Bode Well For McCormickMcCormick’s performance is expected to gain from positive acquisition synergies, particularly from the buyout of Reckitt Benckiser Group. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for year-on-year sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0.18% and 0.25%, respectively. Further, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017, which indicates the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency.Additionally, McCormick’s cost-saving and productivity-enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program are expected to boost profits. The company expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from the previous expectation of at least $100 million.Increasing Costs: A WorryAlthough the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s margins. Prices of raw materials like cinnamon, oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while. In fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. The company’s increased spending on brand marketing also poses adequate threats to profits. (Read More: Will McCormick's (MKC  -  Free Report) Q4 Earnings Gain From Acquisitions?)Wrapping UpMcCormick’s performance in the fourth quarter is likely to benefit from business expansion and cost-saving efforts. We also expect that the company’s efficient pricing strategies will help it tide over cost-related hurdles.Notably, expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 grew 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,475 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.2% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $4.82 billion, up 9.3% from fiscal 2016 sales.All said, we expect McCormick to deliver impressive results in the upcoming release.    Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some more companies which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc.

53,CHD,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been reporting weak organic sales growth along with continued market share losses for quite some time now (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).However, the company has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost savings plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.In order to counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing cost-saving program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters. In the last reported quarter, Procter & Gamble’s core gross margin decreased 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 51.2%, as productivity cost was more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Even, the company’s core operating margin decreased 40 bps year over year to 23% in the quarter, reflecting lower gross margins and higher marketing and overhead costs.That said, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending have helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. Its SG&A margin decreased 10 bps and productivity savings positively impacted its profitability by 190 bps.Overall, for the to-be-reported quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that has heightened further by the recent hurricanes. The company expects higher commodity costs, including pulp, kerosene, ethylene, and propylene, to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings will partly offset these woes.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Gross Margin (TTM)  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Gross Margin (TTM) | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

54,CHD,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell. The bottom-line results of this leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at $1.52 and $4.22, respectively. Expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 depict a growth of 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. Notably, management expects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20-$4.24 per share.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,475 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.2% from sales recorded in the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $4.82 billion, reflecting a rise of 9.3% from fiscal 2016 sales.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick’s performance, aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio. To this end, McCormick’s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, in August 2017, deserves special mention. Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, the deal led to sales growth in the industrial and consumer business segments of the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In fact, the acquisitions of Reckitt Benckiser and Enrico Giotti SpA contributed to sales growth in the third quarter. Further, the company continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group.Driven by such factors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0.18% and 0.25%, respectively.Moreover, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 to reflect the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency. The company expects sales to grow approximately 9-10% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous range of 4-6%. Excluding currency, McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10-11% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous band of 5-7%.McCormick’s cost-saving and productivity-enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program have also been positively impacting performance. Owing to the cost-savings efforts, the company delivered double-digit adjusted operating income growth in the third quarter and expanded adjusted operating income margin by 140 basis points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. McCormick expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from the previous expectation at least $100 million expected previously.Although the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s margins of late. Prices of majority of the raw materials including cinnamon, oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while.

55,CHD,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The company’s total sales grew only 1% in the first quarter. The improvement during the last reported quarter was due to higher shipment volumes. However, lower pricing had a negative impact on sales. Organic sales grew 1%, softer than 2% growth in the prior quarter.Nonetheless, this $65-billion conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Resultantly, Procter & Gamble’s shares have gained 3.2% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 1.2%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although the company has refrained from providing any quarter-specific sales guidance, the company’s management remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3%.Segment Discussion: The Fabric Care and Home Care segment (accounting for 33% of the total sales) is likely to witness 1.9% sequential and 4.1% year-over-year growth to $5.5 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, banking on improvement in both Fabric Care and Home Care divisions.The company’s Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment (accounting for 27% of its total sales) revenues of $4.8 billion is expected to grow 2.6% year over year and 4.9% sequentially in the second quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company remains upbeat about China Baby Care sales this fiscal year and expects Pampers to return to share growth, marking a significant turnaround. Again, premium innovations like Whisper Infinity and Radiant is likely to drive Family Care organic sales.The company’s Beauty segment (19% of total sales) revenues of $3.1 billion is expected to decline 2.1% sequentially but witness 4.5% growth year over year, banking on improvements in Skin & Personal Care, owing to continued growth across PG’s “superpremium” SK-II skincare brand in China.Again, the consensus estimate for Health Care (11%) segment revenues of $2.1 billion are likely to increase 11.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Grooming segment (10% of total sales) revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase of 10.7% from the prior quarter but a decline of 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. Aggressive competitive activity, changes in grooming fashions and habits, and increasing online competitors in some markets like the United States are hurting the performance of the grooming segment.Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%. Revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are likely to increase 2.9% year-over-year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. That said, new product launches are likely to offset the negatives.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Church & Dwight Company, Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Church & Dwight is expected to register 11.5% EPS growth in 2018.Clorox has an expected EPS grow rate of 6.5% for this fiscal year.Colgate-Palmolive projects earnings growth of 8.6% for 2018.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

56,CHD,"Markets ended in negative territory on Friday following the addition of a staggering number of jobs to the U.S. economy. The report led to a surge in interest rates, resulting in benchmark 10-year yield rising to their highest levels since 2014. All the major benchmarks ended in the negative territory, with Dow posting its sixth biggest daily decline since inception.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 2.5%, to close at 25,520. However, the S&P 500 fell 2.1% to close at 2,762.13. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,240.95, losing 2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 37.1% to close at 18.47 — its highest level since November 2016.A total of around 5.39 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.33 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 7.70 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.90-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow nosedived 666 points on Friday to end below the below the 26,000 mark in the negative territory. Such a decline marks its sixth largest drop in terms of points since inception. Moreover, this was also the first time since June 2016 that the blue-chip index plummeted more than 500 points in a single session. Losses for the Dow were rather broad based, with all of its 30 components ending in the red.The S&P 500 lost 60 points to close in negative territory. All of the major 11 sectors of the S&P 500 ended in the red, with energy leading the decliners. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) dipped 4.1% on Friday — its worst one day drop since Jan 25, 2016.Finally, the Nasdaq plunged 145 points following a decline in tech shares. Technology shares declined 3% on Friday following a spate of dismal earnings from some of the big names in the space.Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined 4.3% after reporting first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. The company reported earnings of $3.89 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents and increased almost 16% year over year. Sequentially, earnings jumped 88.2%. However, iPhone unit sales of 77.3 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79.8 million. Apple Services (9.6% of sales) revenues of $8.47 billion also missed the consensus estimate of $8.65 billion. (Read More)Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) declined 5.3% after reporting fourth-quarter diluted non-GAAP earnings of $9.70 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12. However, earnings increased 2% sequentially and 29% year over year. The increased spending on its consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services impacted its profits. (Read More)What Moved the Broader Markets?Broader markets suffered losses on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added a total of 200,000 jobs for the month of January, more than the consensus estimate of 183,000.On the other hand, average hourly earnings surged 0.3%, more than the consensus estimate of 0.2%. This boosted the yearly average to 2.9% — the highest since June 2009. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%.Such staggering figures led to a surge in interest rates, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising as much as 2.9% to hit a four-year high. Such an increase in interest rates weighed on investor sentiment and led to broad based losses for the markets.On the economic data front, total vehicles sales for January increased 17.1%; lower than the consensus estimate of 17.2%. Meanwhile, factory orders remained unchanged at 1.7%, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 1.1%.On the Earnings FrontShares of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) declined 5.1% after reporting fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.88, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Meanwhile, Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report)’s shares declined 5.6% after reporting fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.73, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 4.1%, 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined. An increase in U.S. shale production led energy stocks downward.Moreover, rising bond yields had a broad-based negative impact on all the three key indexes. Markets also lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Finally, investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014.Stocks That Made HeadlinesChurch & Dwight Beats on Q4 Earnings, Guides for FY18Church & Dwight Company, Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged.

57,CHD,"Church & Dwight Company, Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged. However, both top and bottom lines grew year over year. This marked the company’s fifth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise.Adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share were up 18.2% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe company reported sales of $1,033.1 million that advanced 15.3% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,007 million.Organic sales rose 3.4%, which was ahead of the company’s guidance of 2.5%. The uptick was driven by better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. Further, organic sales were fueled by volumes growth of 4.3%.Adjusted gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 46.6% owing to gains from productivity programs, volume growth, and acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter excluded a prior-year Brazil charge. Adjusted operating margin also increased 90 bps to 20.8% driven by higher gross margin.Segment DetailsConsumer Domestic: Segment net sales were up 13.3% to $787.8 million and organic sales improved 2.7% benefiting from a 4% increase in volume, partly negated by a 1.3% negative impact from price. Volume gains in the quarter can be attributed to key product launches and increased personal care products sales.VITAFUSION adult gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH toothbrushes, ORAJEL oral analgesics, BATISTE dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER baking soda continued to be the main growth drivers.Consumer International: Segment net sales soared 33.3% to $170.1 million backed by recent acquisitions and broad-based sales growth for household and personal care products. Organic sales increased 5.8% driven by a 6% increase in volumes, partly mitigated by a 0.2% fall in price.STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada provided a major impetus to sales.Specialty Products: Sales at this segment improved 3% to $75.2 million. Organic sales advanced 5.1% backed by 2.8% higher volumes and favorable pricing (up 2.3%), mainly in the animal productivity business.Other Financial UpdatesChurch & Dwight ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $278.9 million, long-term debt of $2,103.4 million and total shareholders’ equity of $2,218 million.In 2017, the company generated cash flow from operations of $681.5 million and incurred capital expenditure of $45 million.Concurrently, management raised quarterly cash dividend to 21.75 cents per share, marking a 14% increase from the previous dividend rate of 19 cents. This brings the annualized dividend to 87 cents per share, raising the dividend payout to nearly $215 million. The increased dividend is payable on Mar 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as on Feb 15. This marks the company’s 22nd straight year of dividend increase. Moreover, the company has regularly paid dividend for 117 years.Guidance for 2018Innovations have been a key growth driver for Church & Dwight. As part of its long-term strategy to boost top and bottom lines, the company announced several new product launches in various categories.The company expects reported sales to grow about 8% and organic sales to rise 3% in 2018. Though recent acquisitions are anticipated to attract lower marketing, the company plans to increase spending to maintain marketing at nearly 12% of sales. Further, the company expects SG&A expenses to increase, as a percentage of sales, owing to lower intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions.As a result of the new tax reform, the company anticipates reduced tax burden. The effective tax rate is expected to be about 24-25% compared with 32% in 2017. Consequently, the company estimates earnings per share of $2.24-$2.28, reflecting adjusted earnings per share growth of 16-18%. However, reported earnings per share are expected to decline 21-23%. The company’s guidance assumes persistent business strength, a lower tax rate and reinvestment to accelerate growth, and other long-term objectives.Q1 OutlookFor the first quarter of 2018, the company expects reported and organic sales growth of 11% and 2%, respectively. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents in the quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19.6%.

58,CHD,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 10, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.4%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.3%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q2PepsiCo has been head on heels trying to improve its performance through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. The success of the company’s initiatives was well reflected in first-quarter 2018 earnings, which were driven by strong international performance on revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.Moreover, the company’s fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio, product innovation and strong snacks business. Notably, PepsiCo has delivered positive earnings surprise for eight consecutive quarters.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteAs a result, PepsiCo stock has been gaining over the past month, reflecting a positive sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have increased 7.9%, outperforming the industry’s 4.4% rise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is $1.51 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 0.7%. However, we note that the consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter has moved south in the last seven days. The downward estimate movement can be attributed to the fact that the beverage industry is witnessing sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes, which is a pressing concern. CSD volumes for PepsiCo’s North America Beverages (NAB) business decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2018. Looking back, PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015, 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2017 in the NAB business.Furthermore, consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. To this end, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo’s total net revenues comes from “Guilt-Free” products, more than half of which comes from the “Everyday Nutrition” category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company’s stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.PepsiCo has also broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas, keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. The company’s non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.Nonetheless, results of the NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the first quarter. This is because it was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Segment DiscussionPepsiCo’s North America Beverages or NAB business accounts for about 33% of the company’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 1% in first-quarter 2018, preceded by declines of 6% and 3% in the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017. However, the metric remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $5.18 billion. This reflects an increase from $4.4 billion reported in the first quarter and a decline from $5.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.For the Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), PepsiCo had a good balance of volume growth and net price realization. The segment’s revenues improved 3% last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, mirroring an increase from $3.6 billion in the prior quarter and $3.7 billion in the year-ago period.The Quaker Foods North America segment revenues improved marginally in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $551 million compared with $601 million in the first quarter and $553 million in the second quarter of 2017.The Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 15% in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.04 billion, implying an increase from $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter and $1.7 billion last quarter.The Latin America segment revenues were up 14% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in first-quarter 2018.Revenues at the Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment improved 7% year over year in the first quarter. The metric is likely to increase to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2018 from $1.6 billion registered in the year-ago period and $1.04 billion in the prior quarter, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $16.1 billion, reflecting 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.18%.

59,CHD,"Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jul 9. This consumer products player has delivered positive earnings surprise for eleven straight quarters now. Let’s see what’s in store for the company this time around.Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Helen of Troy Limited QuoteFactors Driving Helen of TroyHelen of Troy is likely to continue gaining from its Transformation Plan, which concentrates on making investments in core areas, undertaking customer-centric innovations, undertaking prudent mergers and acquisitions, building superior shared services, making upgrades to workforce and systems, and reducing wastage to improve quality and curtail costs. These factors drove Helen of Troy in the last reported quarter, wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results were driven by solid performance by Leadership Brands along with growth in online sales. Markedly, Helen of Troy has been focused on making solid investments in its Leadership Brands, which are considered most productive as they have been delivering robust results.To this end, the company is on track with its investments in product launches, marketing efforts and e-commerce strategies for these brands, which are the highest margin, greatest volume generating and most efficient businesses for the company. Further, the company is likely to keep gaining from its consistent online sales and digital marketing efforts, on the back of which online sales increased in all three segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Talking of segments, the company’s Health & Home unit delivered one of its best quarters in a long time.Will the Hurdles Be Offset?However, the company’s Beauty segment sales did not witness even a single quarter of year-over-year growth, throughout fiscal 2018. The Beauty segment has been suffering from softness in personal care category, mainly due to tough competition. In the fourth quarter, Beauty segment sales fell 2.1% on account of weakness across brick and mortar channels. Further, Beauty sales are projected to dip in low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2019, which remains a concern for the top line in the quarter under review as well.Also, on the cost front, the company witnessed contraction in gross and operating margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin fell 30 basis points, due to increased promotions and adverse channel mix. Further, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales escalated 60 basis points on account of increased incentive compensation, and higher advertising and new product development costs, among others.Well, overall rise in commodity and transportation costs creates a competitive pricing environment, which keeps margins under pressure. Moreover, management expects fiscal 2019 bottom-line growth to be hit by a rise in investments to fuel the company’s Leadership Brands.  Nonetheless, the aforementioned growth drivers as well as Helen of Troy’s Project Refuel should help the company overcome these hurdles. The Project Refuel restructuring plan was initiated to improve the performance of the company’s Beauty and Nutritional Supplements units. After the sale of Nutritional Supplements, management continues to target generating annualized profit growth of nearly $8.0 million over the tenure of this strategic plan.Q1 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $333 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.33, which shows a 3.9% jump from the year-ago period. Notably, the earnings estimates witnessed a 6.7% uptrend in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Helen of Troyis likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Helen of Troy carries a Zacks Rank #3, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.17% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

60,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc.’s (CHD  -  Free Report) consumer international segment has been performing well for quite some time now, thereby driving its top line.In first-quarter 2018, overall international sales surged 26.3%, driven by recent acquisitions, broad-based sales growth for household and personal care products, and improvements in export business. Notably, the segment received considerable impetus from OXICLEAN in the export business — STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico, and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets.In fact, the international consumer business has been a growth driver over the past few years and exceeded expectations with 11.8%, 7.4%, 6.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The company is also opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong.Further, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which is likely to be a major growth driver in future. This is evident from the company’s recent tie-up with DKSH, to make the latter Church & Dwight’s leading distributor in Southeast Asia.Also, the international consumer business has been consistently contributing to organic sales growth of the company. Evidently, organic sales grew 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018. Further, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively.In the first quarter, organic sales growth was driven by a 4.2% rise in global consumer products growth. This was backed by organic sales growth across both Consumer Domestic and International segment, wherein organic sales rose 3.6% and 6.8%, respectively. Organic sales at Consumer International segment was backed by improved volumes (up 1.6%), along with better price and product mix (up 5.2%).Continued strength at Consumer International along with solid growth in Consumer Domestic businesses drove Church & Dwight’s results in the first quarter. Both top and bottom lines grew year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, this marked the company’s sixth and third consecutive quarter of positive earnings and sales surprise, respectively.

This in turn was fueled by higher volumes (up 4.7%), somewhat negated by unfavorable product mix and pricing.Adjusted gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 44.9% due to increased commodity and transportation expenses. Further, marketing costs (as a percentage of sales) escalated 20 bps to 10.5%, excluding buyouts. SG&A costs also rose 30 bps as a percentage of sales to 13.1%, mainly due to buyouts.Segment DetailsConsumer Domestic: Segment net sales were up 13.9% to $751.4 million, courtesy of gains from acquisitions and higher household and personal care sales. Organic sales improved 3.6% benefiting from a 5.3% increase in volume, partly negated by a 1.7% negative impact from price and product mix.ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OXICLEAN stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins and TOPPIK and VIVISCAL hair care businesses continued to be the main growth drivers.Consumer International: Segment net sales soared 26.3% to $180.7 million backed by recent acquisitions, broad-based sales growth for household and personal care products and improvements in export business. Organic sales jumped 6.8% driven by improved volumes (up 1.6%), along with better price and product mix (up 5.2%).OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia provided an impetus to organic sales.Specialty Products: Sales at this segment dipped 0.7% to $73.9 million. Organic sales slipped 1%, on account of a 3.8% drop in volumes, somewhat cushioned by favorable commodity pass-through pricing (up 2.8%), mainly in the animal productivity business. Management stated that reduced milk prices has been leading to soft demand in the dairy industry. On the contrary, poultry industry demand is on the rise, which has reduced the company’s focus on the dairy industry.Other Financial UpdatesChurch & Dwight ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $119.8 million, long-term debt of $1,802.1 million and total shareholders’ equity of $2,143.3 million.In the first quarter, the company generated cash flow from operations of $155.5 million and incurred capital expenditure of $9.9 million.The company recently announced a quarterly dividend of 21.75 cents per share, which is payable on Jun 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as on May 15.Guidance for 2018Innovations have been a key driver for Church & Dwight.

These factors, which helped the company retain its solid earnings surprise trend in first-quarter 2018, are expected to fuel growth further at the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.While Church & Dwight has gained 4% in the past six months, it has fared much better than the industry that has tumbled 8.7%.

Moving ahead, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs are expected to keep driving its performance.Management expects solid volume growth and improved market share to drive 2018 results.

64,CHD,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for TreeHouse Foods this time around. TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Quote Headwinds Looming Over TreeHouse FoodsTreeHouse Foods’ last reported results marked its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in earnings and sales. The company has been bearing the brunt of pricing pressure stemming from stiff competition in the grocery industry. This, along with commodity cost inflation and rising freight costs has been marring TreeHouse Foods’ DOI margin for a while now.These factors were reflected in the fourth quarter, wherein earnings bore the brunt of soft sales and margins, whereas revenues were marred by divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. Divestiture of SIF business led to reduced sales at Baked Goods and Meals segments. Further, intense industry competition pressurized pricing in most segments, while volume/mix also remained challenged in the Meals segment. Apart from this, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the company’s direct operating income (DOI) margin, which marked its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year contraction.Can Strategy for 2020 Provide Respite?The company remains on track with its TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that was announced in second-quarter 2017. The plan was designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Alongside of cost savings, the initiative is expected to manage the company’s portfolio and optimize production and supply chain.  TreeHouse 2020 aims to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020, by undertaking complete business integration and expense reduction.However, it looks like these efforts will take time to offset the hurdles completely. Unfortunately, management expects input cost inflation to remain a headwind in 2018, wherein freight costs are also expected to be a major deterrent. These hiccups also weighed on management’s guidance for the first quarter. Earnings for the first quarter are expected in the range of 10-20 cents per share, which shows a year-over-year decline due to soft volumes, operational inefficiencies, and the unfavorable timing of elevated commodity and freight costs with respect to pricing.The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to slump 77.1% year over year to 14 cents. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1,427 million, down from $1,536 million recorded in the year-ago period.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Even though TreeHouse Foods has an Earnings ESP of +1.03%, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into earnings announcements.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

65,CHD,"We expect Kellogg Company (KHC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 3. Last quarter, this cereal and snacks company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.95%. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.16%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Per our proven model, Kellogg has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of +2.17%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #2.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets, as well as soft U.S. snacks business, owing to lower demand.Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kellogg, like a number of other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the company expects its sales in the European business to remain soft in the second quarter due to lower volumes, tough comparisons and currency headwinds. However, strong performance in Latin America and Asia is likely to compensate for the above headwinds.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. In order to counter the sluggish sales trend, the company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation.Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 92 cents, reflecting a 1.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is $3.15 billion, implying a 3.5% decline.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Hence, weak consumption trends in the U.S. along with currency headwinds in Europe are likely to restrict sales growth in the near term.Nonetheless, this Pittsburgh, PA-based packaged food company’s cost-savings and restructuring initiatives have been giving a boost to the margins, thereby driving the bottom line, which is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also expects its go-to-market activity to normalize in Canada, which is likely to further support sales.That said, adverse impact of lower volumes and higher commodity costs raise concern.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 13.1% year-over-year increase.

These factors have been driving Church & Dwight for a while now, with the Consumer International segment in particular.Consumer International to Remain a Major Driver Church & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2%, thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Clearly, this segment holds immense potential and is likely to sustain its splendid trend this time around as well. Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $154 million, reflecting a solid 20.3% upside from the year-ago reported figure.Growth Initiatives to Continue Driving Performance Further, Church & Dwight’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future. As for acquisitions, Church & Dwight has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in third-quarter 2017 and is on track with its integration.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Quote Together, such strategic endeavors drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. While this marked the consumer products giant’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In fact, Church & Dwight’s strong record has helped it jump 10.58% in the past three months, crushing the industry’s 2% growth. Delving deeper into the results, we note that improved volumes drove organic sales by 3.2% — thereby retaining its long year-over-year growth trend. Apart from continued strength at consumer international, organic sales were also backed by growth in domestic sales and solid Specialty Products business improvement. In fact, broad-based growth across segments also helped the company to offset high promotional costs and generate bottom-line growth. A look at the consensus marks for sales for Church & Dwight’s other segment reveals that, Consumer Domestic segment is likely to deliver sales of $776 million (up from $695 million posted in the year-ago period), while consensus estimate for sales at the Specialty Products unit stands at $77 million (up 4.1% from the year-ago reported figure).Q4 & 2017 Expectations as a WholeAll, said we expect this New Jersey-based company’s broad-based strength to continue helping it overcome increased promotional and other expenditures this time around. Encouragingly, management expects reported and organic sales growth of 11.2% and 3.2%, respectively in the fourth quarter. International sales are anticipated to jump 6.2%, whereas sales of Specialty Products are expected to advance 7.5%, both on reported and organic basis.  Management also expects domestic volumes to gain 7% and lead to market share gains. All said, the company expects adjusted earnings of 50 cents in the fourth quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 50 cents, which represents more than 13% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,007 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago reported figure. For full-year 2017, Church & Dwight envisions bottom line to increase 8.5% year over year to $1.92, which is in line with the consensus mark.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

70,CHD,"Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5. The food products giant delivered positive earnings surprise in seven out of the past eight quarters, while sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters. Sysco’s strong record has also helped it to jump 22.8% in a year against the industry that dipped 0.2%.So, let’s see if this Texas-based company can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Factors at PlayWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from its cost-saving and revenue-management efforts, which have been driving its performance for a while now. Incidentally, the company has been impressively managing expenses for the past few years, and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain areas. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements.Driven by these endeavors, the company remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600-$650 million through the end of FY18. This growth is expected to come from lower administrative costs and improving gross margin, which gives out positive signals for the quarter under review.Further, the company’s focus on acquisitions, new product developments, value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities remains a growth driver. In this regard, the company’s recent acquisition of HFM Foodservice is likely to augment its top line, by boosting revenues of the U.S. Foodservice segment. Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than aiding sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Backed by these factors, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for quite some time now, and we expect this trend to continue in the quarter to be reported.How Are Sysco’s Segments Placed?Taking a segment-wise look, we remain optimistic about the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, which delivered a strong performance in the last reported quarter despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes. Notably, sales in this segment advanced 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations up 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8%, backed by the company’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives.Going forward, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $9,561 million, which reflects 5.2% growth from the year-ago period.Moving to the International Foodservice Operations, this unit delivered improved sales too in the last reported quarter. However, results were partly hurt by softness in Europe, which is battling slow traffic. Moreover, weak UK currency resulted in food cost inflation, thereby leading to pricing pressure. These headwinds are likely to persist throughout the fiscal, though management remains focused on reducing the impact of such obstacles. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about the growth prospects in Latin America. Markedly, the consensus mark for International sales stands at $2,784 million compared with $2,626 million in the same year-ago period.The company also remains hopeful of growth in its SYGMA segment, for which the consensus estimate for sales is $1,613 million, up 6.1% from the year-ago reported sales figure.Q2 Expectations as a WholeSysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation QuoteGiven these factors and Sysco’s focus on its recently announced strategies for 2020, we believe that the company will continue with its top and bottom-line growth in the second quarter.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents, which represents more than 12% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,186 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model Unveils?To top it, our proven model shows that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

71,CHD,"After a blissful holiday season, investors’ focus has shifted to the fourth quarter reporting cycle, which is probably the most significant among all quarters. The fourth-quarter outcome not only lends a deep insight into the companies’ annual performance but also gives signals for the next reporting year, helping investors take a stock of their portfolio.This earnings season is on the verge of being in full swing and the trend so far appears quite good. Notably, 44 S&P 500 companies have already posted results with earnings up 11.4% on revenue growth of 7.5%, per the latest Earnings Preview report. Also, 77.3% of these companies topped on earnings and revenue estimates.Focusing our attention on the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, we are yet to witness the main show from the space. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, this sector is ranked among the top 38% and seems quite well-placed for the ongoing earnings season on the back of favorable economic indicators as well as the companies’ strategic growth endeavors.An Introspection of Consumer Staples SpaceThe Consumer Staples sector, considered defensive even in rough tides, has been benefiting from the uptick in the U.S. economy. With unemployment rate at its 17-year low, favorable consumer spending, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, the economy appears in good shape.  To top it all, President Trump’s recent tax overhaul is likely to provide a major cushion to many consumer companies. Taking a look at the companies’ growth efforts such as focus on innovations, strategic buyouts as well as product launches, these factors are likely to keep driving the players in this space.Certainly, these endeavors seem appropriate given the heightened competition, price wars, input cost inflation and promotional environment. Also, aggressive cost-saving initiatives and attempts to keep pace with changing consumer patterns make us optimistic about the stocks.The impact of these factors is clearly visible in the overall expectations for the sector. For this earnings season, the bottom line of the Consumer Staples space is envisioned to climb 4.5% year over year with the top line anticipated to advance 3.5% (per the latest Earnings Trends report). Notably, these forecasts fare better than the previous quarter’s earnings and revenue improvements of 3.9% and 1.9%, respectively.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonFinally, we used the Zacks methodology to identify Consumer Staples stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Thus, investors can count on these stocks, which are most likely to trump estimates.Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5, is a solid bet. The company’s Earnings ESP of +0.30% and Zacks Rank #2 make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise. We expect the company to continue gaining from constant investments in product innovations as well as its focus on buyouts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 is pegged at 50 cents and $1.92, respectively.We also suggest investing in Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR  -  Free Report), expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 12. This manufacturer and distributor of fragrance and cosmetic products has an Earnings ESP of +5.77%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter and full year is currently pegged at 10 cents and $1.29, respectively. Further, the company, which has delivered positive earnings surprises in all the trailing four quarters, carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock worth considering is Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report), which has an Earnings ESP of +42.86% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. This Oregon-based brewer is expected to post fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 15. Craft Brew’s consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 4 cents for the fourth quarter and 12 cents for 2017. Notably, the company boasts an impressive bottom-line surprise history.Another viable option is Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), a major manufacturer and marketer of ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.44%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter and full year is pegged at 96 cents and $4.03, respectively. The company with a solid earnings surprise history is slated to announce fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. We expect Kellogg to gain from its robust cost-saving initiatives as well as investments in brand building and innovations.Investors can also place bets on Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1.  This leading tobacco company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.4% and is likely to gain from its focus on expanding in the smokeless products category and efficient pricing. Notably, Altria’ Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62% indicate the company to likely post another earnings beat this time. The consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 81 cents while the same for 2017 stands at $3.28.Well, these five stocks are not the only bets to put money on. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screenerand some permutation and combination, investors may also discover other consumer staples stocks with strong potential to pull off a positive earnings surprise.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

72,CHD,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. This global brewer has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Molson Coors this time around. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise   Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe expect Molson Coors to continue gaining from its solid focus on cost savings, which have been driving year-over-year growth at its bottom line for nearly a year now. Notably, the company has been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability. These initiatives include closure of underperforming breweries, improving efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources and reducing labor and general overhead costs. Also, the company has been focusing on improving supply chain network and building on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation. These endeavors helped Molson Coors generate cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017 that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, management raised its three-year savings goal (up to 2019) to $600 million, which is likely to help the company expand its EBITDA margins. These dedicated efforts give out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well.However, input cost inflation remains a concern, as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. Incidentally, for 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across all segments, except International. These factors may act as hurdles in the company’s upcoming release.Can Molson Coors Cheer Investors? Molson Coors’ top line has been gaining from focus on strengthening brand portfolio. Armed with a robust portfolio of well-established brands, the company has been steadily progressing with growth of its above-premium segment. Impressively, the company has also been gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. We believe the company’s shift of focus on expanding the above premium category along with solid innovation program is likely to positively impact the upcoming quarter.However, we remain cautious about the company’s U.S. volumes, which remained soft and ended up hurting Molson Coors’ overall worldwide brand volume as well as its financial volumes in the last reported quarter. In fact, Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline.A Look Back & Expectations for Q1Molson Coors ended 2017 on a superb note as in the fourth quarter, both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were backed by sales growth in most regions (except United States), favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, greater royalty volumes, cost-saving benefits, MG&A efficiencies and cycling of indirect tax provision. However, the U.S. region continued with its dull volumes, as it witnessed a decline in both sales-to-retailers (STRs) volume and sales-to-wholesalers’ volume, which fell 3% and 1.5%, respectively. These factors pose concerns over the company’s top line for the quarter to be reported.For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales in Central Europe to dip 1.8% year over year to $375 million. The consensus marks for net sales in Canada and International is pegged at $288 million and $66 million, compared to $291 million and $62 million reported in the year-ago period respectively. Also, the consensus estimate for U.S. sales stands at $1,734 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall revenues is $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million recorded in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, management remained impressed with its performance amid the tough market conditions. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms and focus on First Choice, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors prospects. Well, underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range 18-22%, which is considerably low and also makes us hopeful about first-quarter earnings. The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Molson Coors is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Molson Coors Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21% makes us less confident about earnings beat. In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

73,CHD,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents for the quarter under review moved south by 3 cents in the last seven days and reflects a decline of 6.7% year over year.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has been struggling with a dismal surprise history for quite a long time. In fact, the company has lagged sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14,965 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.In the previous quarter, the company’s margins remained under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Oilseeds Processing segment. Despite robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins and lower South American origination margins. These factors also hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results affected Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations.However, Archer Daniels’ solid focus on cost savings to strengthen business is commendable. It remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A. Furthermore, the company’s Project Readiness program that aims at enhancing operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks to curtail costs bodes well. Management has also been on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program.In March, management realigned its business into four segments namely Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination, to accelerate growth and resonate well with changing customers’ needs. These changes will be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results. The new business segments are expected to clearly differentiate the company’s product and service offerings, while justifying its operating structure. Additionally, the segments should help Archer Daniels provide value-added and exclusive product assortments, hence boost growth across its business portfolio. These efforts, in turn, are likely to add stimulus to the company’s performance and profitability.Given the major strengths and weaknesses, let’s wait and see what lies ahead for Archer Daniels when it reports quarterly results.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

74,CHD,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 14 and four consecutive quarters, respectively. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the company’s well-chalked buyouts, innovations, savings efforts, strong market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network.On the flip side, the company has been facing receding traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Moreover, the company’s gross margins have been strained for a while now, thanks to a mix of factors.On that note, let’s see if Estee Lauder’s growth can counter the aforementioned hurdles and aid it in maintaining its spectacular surprise streak alive this time.Acquisitions to Boost ResultsThis cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have been strengthening its fastest-growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Estee Lauder’s investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is likely to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods. The company’s previous moves in this regard include the buyout of By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW. Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has also acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brands such as Le Labo (The Lab) and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Quote E-commerce & Travel Retail to Drive GrowthEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years. The company has been constantly implementing digital experiences such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. Further, Estee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged a major sales driver for the company. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by the company’s continued investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, along with double-digit increases in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Well, the company is committed toward undertaking greater strategic efforts to enhance travel retail business.Forecasts Look BrightBuoyed by the aforementioned factors, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.02-$1.04 per share for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the previous projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for the said period is currently pegged higher at $1.07.Further analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management predicts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter. Foreign currency is expected to positively impact sales by 3%. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 9-10%.  Can Efforts Offset Hurdles?Persisting concerns surrounding lower sales in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores has been a concern for Estee Lauder for quite some time. Also, the company is cautious about social, economic and political issues that could affect consumer spending in few countries. Further, the company has been struggling with gross margin declines for more than four quarters now.Nevertheless, we expect the company to overcome the impacts of such hurdles with the help of the aforementioned growth drivers. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. All these upsides, along with expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keep management encouraged about continuing with its sturdy performance in the second half and fiscal 2018. Well investors’ too are optimistic regarding the stock, evident from its astounding 69.4% surge in the past year, while the industry rallied 35.1%.All said, lets now finally take a look at what the Zacks Model unveils regarding Estee Lauder’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Estee Lauder is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The buyout deal is currently subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority.A Win-Win Strategy for BothUpon approval of the deal, Kent Frozen Foods will form part of Sysco’s U.K. and European business bandwagon, which already includes popular names such as M&J Seafood, Fresh Direct and Brakes. Per the norms of the deal, although Kent Frozen Foods will continue to function as a separate entity, it is set to gain from Sysco’s superior hold and brand image in the foodservice market. Further, the deal will enable Kent to establish closer ties with other businesses of Sysco in the U.K. and European regions.From Sysco’s point of view, acquisitions have always been profitable and aided in augmenting its market share and distribution network, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. Notably, the company expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions, in the long run.Looking back, in 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores. Apart from that, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.That said, we expect Sysco’s latest venture of adding Kent Frozen Foods to its business portfolio to result in boosting its international presence. In addition to augmenting product offerings, Sysco is expected to reap gains from Kent Frozen Foods’ focus on independent customers.Other Growth Oriented Moves of SyscoSysco outlined some key growth strategies at the New York Investor Day event on December 2017, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency. Furthermore, by evolving with changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve the supply chain, increase transparency and enhance delivery capacity.Driven by these strategies, Sysco expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55-65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25% by 2020. Earnings per share are envisioned to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020.  Going ahead, we expect such efficient financial plans, supported by strong balance sheet and cash positions, to aid the company in continuing with its investments and expansion efforts. Markedly, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s strategic growth endeavors have augmented its business capabilities and made it a strong contender in the foodservices arena. Such factors have also acted as a catalyst in enhancing investors’ confidence, evident from the stock’s 21% surge in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 0.6%.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

This has helped the company put up an impressive record of earnings and sales surprises.Notably, this consumer products behemoth has gained 8.1% in the past three months, against the industry’s decline of 4.5%. So, let’s take a closer view of the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on.Focus on 2020 StrategyClorox is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of e-commerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight. The strategy aims at achieving certain long-term goals, including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points (bps) and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.Brand Management, Go Lean StrategyClorox's diversified brand portfolio positions it well ahead of peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain it in the currently challenging environment. The company remains committed to investing in product and brand differentiation to safeguard value proposition. The company’s approach to brand management allows each of its brands to develop further through rigorous research and development (R&D), marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage.Further, the company is focused on strong investments in demand building, including digital marketing, e-commerce and product innovation pipeline. It is also well placed to improve margins through cost saving and productivity initiatives. Moreover, the company’s Go Lean strategy in International remains focused on improving margins through operational efficiencies. We believe these strategies will aid the company in catering to near-term challenges.Keeps with Current Trends – E-commerce in FocusIn response to the changing retail environment, Clorox is keen on making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities not only in the physical world but also online. Consequently, the company has bolstered digital capabilities in the last few years leading to a strong performance in e-commerce, which now represents 4% of total sales. Moreover, the company recorded nearly 40% annual growth in e-commerce sales in the last two fiscal years. Looking ahead, the company is ahead of track and nearing its 2020 target of $500 million from e-commerce sales.Clorox’s Strategies Aid Quarterly PerformanceClorox’s actions and strategic initiatives have gone a long way in aiding the company’s earnings and sales scores. The company has a marked record of delivering positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, while sales has topped estimates in the preceding two quarters. The company’s last reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings gained from solid sales and gross margin expansion, while sales was driven by growth across the United Sates and International businesses, alongside rise in volumes.Growth at the International business was particularly backed by increased pricing, offset by unfavorable mix. Additionally, the company’s efficient cost-saving initiatives and improved International pricing aided gross margin growth. Going forward, the company remains confident of the continued strength in underlying business performance.Uptrend in EstimatesClorox’s robust past performances and a favorable view on its business has led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last 30 days. This indicates that the investor community is watchful of the company’s actions and holds a positive outlook on the stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second quarter has moved up by 1 cent to $1.22 per share and estimate for fiscal 2018 it has surged by 10 cents to $5.70 per share.

77,CHD,"Hillenbrand, Inc. (HI  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 3. The company has been delivering positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters now, buoyed by a flourishing Process Equipment business. However, headwinds in the Batesville unit have been a worry.With these factors in mind, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the quarterly announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q2Hillenbrand has been witnessing year-over-year growth in the top and the bottom line for more than a year. Well, the company has been gaining from strength in the Process Equipment segment. The segment has been delivering impressive results on the back of higher demand for screening and separating equipment as well as plastics projects. Incidentally, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues in this segment jumped 19% year over year to reach $264 millionFurther, the company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipment market by investing in enhanced expertise and engineering solutions, to cater to consumer more effectively. Indeed, such upsides have been fueling investors’ optimism in the stock, which surged 27% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 5.7%.   We expect that strength in the Process Equipment segment will continue to drive Hillenbrand’s performance in the impeding quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the second quarter is pegged at 60 cents, depicting an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. This estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $417 million, reflecting a rise of almost 5.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.On the flip side, Hillenbrand has long been struggling with its Batesville business segment, thanks to lower burial volumes, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. Evidently, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, segment revenues fell 1% to $133 million. Moreover, performance in this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger and hurt revenues as well as margins in second-quarter fiscal 2018, which is a concern. Nevertheless, we expect the Process Equipment unit to sufficiently cushion Hillenbrand in countering the headwinds in the Batesville segment. Hillenbrand Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hillenbrand Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hillenbrand Inc Quote All said, let take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

78,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) has all those things it takes to be able to witness growth – robust international presence, impressive organic sales trend and much more. In fact, courtesy of these factors, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has managed to return 3.8% in the past six months, even when the industry was down 9.4%.   Though escalated costs remain a threat to margins, we expect the Church & Dwight’s strategic growth efforts to help offset these hurdles and fuel further growth at the company, which possesses a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.5%. On that note, let’s delve deeper into these catalysts.Focus on Acquisitions Strengthens PortfolioChurch & Dwight, which started with only one brand (ARM & HAMMER) has acquired a number of premium brands over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, which is expected to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is  on track with its integration. The company's other recent acquisitions include Agro BioSciences in May 2017 and VIVISCAL business in January 2017. Prior to that, the acquisitions of ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson in December 2016 helped the company boost its business internationally.International Consumer Business: A Major Growth AvenueThe company’s international consumer business has been consistently contributing to organic sales growth of the company. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8% courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Notably, the international consumer business has been a growth driver over the past few years and exceeded expectations with 11.8%, 7.4% and 6.2% organic growth in the first, second and third-quarter 2017, respectively. In fact, the international business grew 8% in 2015, 10% in 2016 and 18.3% in 2017.The company is also opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong. Further, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which is likely to be a major growth driver in future. This is well-evident from the company’s recent tie-up with DKSH, to make the latter Church & Diwght’s leading distributor in Southeast Asia. The company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth.Organic Sales Trend Bodes WellChurch & Dwight has been witnessing organic sales growth for quite some time now, backed by its solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth came ahead of the company’s guidance of 2.5% and was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. Organic sales rose 2.7%, 5.8% and 5.1% in the Consumer Domestic, International and Specialty Products segments, respectively. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which is also its evergreen annual growth target.Q4 Retains Earnings Surprise Trend, View Looks EncouragingBuoyed by these factors, Church & Dwight marked its fifth consecutive positive earnings surprise, when it came out with fourth-quarter 2018 – wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year. Further, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs are expected to keep driving its performance. Also, management remains impressed with the broad-based growth and expects gains from tax reforms to benefit the bottom line. The effective tax rate in 2018 is expected to be about 24-25% compared with 32% in 2017. Consequently, the company estimates earnings per share of $2.24-$2.28, reflecting 16-18% growth in 2018.Shareholder-Friendly Moves Instill OptimismApart from this, the consumer goods behemoth has a consistent track record of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases. In fact, management recently raised its quarterly dividend by 14%, which marked the company’s 22nd straight year of dividend increase. Notably, the company has regularly paid dividend for 117 years. Also, in the last quarter management authorized a new buyback plan of shares up to $500 million.Clearly, these factors reflect Church & Dwight’s robust ongoing prospects, which should drive further cheerfulness among investors.Looking for More Promising Bets?

79,CHD,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. The dividend will be paid on or after May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Apr 20, 2018. The new figure will add up to an annual dividend of $2.8688 per share.This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike that reflects the company’s commitment to add value to shareholders, reflecting its confidence in business growth.P&G is considered to be one of the dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 Index, given its consistent increase in dividends each year in its span of operations of more than 100 years in business. This, along with a dividend yield of more than 3% (3.53% as of Apr 10, 2018) helped P&G to attain the position.P&G generates strong cash flow annually. The company generated operating cash flow of $7.3 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with $6 billion a year ago. The company spent $1.9 billion as capital spending in fiscal 2018 so far. Thus, the company was left with a significant free cash flow of $5.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in the year-ago period. This allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and brand development, in addition to regularly paying dividends and repurchasing shares. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the company returned $7.9 billion of cash to shareholders via $3.6 billion of dividend payments and $4.3 billion of common stock repurchase.P&G is known for strong brand recognition, diversified portfolio, impressive product development capabilities and marketing prowess, as well as strong cash flow productivity. The company remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging and marketing initiatives, and productivity cost-savings plan.Additionally, growth from emerging markets like China and India is expected to make 2018 another strong year for P&G. For fiscal 2018, P&G expects earnings per share growth of 5-8%, a modest improvement from the prior expectation of 5-7% growth.Investors should keep in mind that P&G's shares have lost around 13.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with 3.5% decline of its industry. The 13.2% decline also compares unfavorably with the broader Consumer Staples sector’s decrease of 1.9%. Earnings estimates have remained stable for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days.The recent dividend hike is expected to bolster investors’ confidence in the company’s financials, improve its market position against competitors and lend upside to the stock.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksP&G carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Tyson Foods, Inc.

80,CHD,"Driven by consumers’ improved spending on beauty and personal care products, The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been depicting sturdy growth across most of its geographic regions and product categories. Moreover, the company has been resorting to acquisitions and expanding online sales channels to further strengthen its foothold in the industry.Well, the impact of such factors is evident from this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s bull run in the stock market. Shares of this leading cosmetics company witnessed an astounding surge of 61% in a year compared with the industry’s rise of 32.1%. Let’s now take a look into the aspects driving this spectacular growth and see if the company can add new leaves to its growth story.Acquisitions Boost PerformanceEstee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced has strengthened its fastest-growing prestige portfolio and contributed significantly to sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The investment in DECIEM, a fast-growing multi-brand company, is also likely to aid top-line performance in the forthcoming periods.  Prospects in Emerging MarketsEstee Lauder has a strong presence in the emerging markets which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The company derives a significant amount of its revenues from the emerging markets. In fact, Brazil is one of Estee Lauder’s fastest-growing markets, driven largely by M-A-C, DKNY and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Also, The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Notably, Estee Lauder has bright prospects in China, wherein sales soared nearly 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s Chinese operations have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management envisions persistent strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region.Surging Online BusinessEstee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.

Owing to technological advancement and growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for each store appointment, and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line in the forthcoming periods.Looking AheadEstee Lauder projects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 4-5% during fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company’s strong fundamentals have led management to provide an optimistic view for the year.

81,CHD,"SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) is witnessing no relief from adverse industry conditions, which are plaguing its retail segment’s performance. This, in combination with the company’s dismal gross margin trend, has been a hurdle for long.  The implication of such factors is quite apparent from the recent downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate and investors’ receding optimism in the stock, following its third-quarter fiscal 2018 outcome.Evidently, shares of this leading grocery company declined almost 16.8% over the last three trading sessions, post the company’s quarterly results on Jan 10, 2018.  In fact, SUPERVALU’s shares have been struggling for a while.  The company’s shares plunged almost 45% in a year, much wider than the industry’s dip of 3.8%.Soft Retail Business & Gross Margins: A Consistent WorryWhile earnings for third-quarter fiscal 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales missed the same, on account of underlying weakness in the retail segment. Well, the issues pertaining to the retail segment runs deep and has been pulling down the company’s overall results for a while. Price competition, competitive store openings and intense promotional environment are major deterrents. Markedly, the company has been witnessing identical store sales decline in the retail segment for the past 11 quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, identical store sales dropped 3.5%, which along with store closures caused net sales at the retail unit to tumble 4.1% to $1,017 million. Moreover, the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $3 million, while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions. Unfortunately, management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018.In addition to the worries pertaining to the retail segment, SUPERVALU has been suffering year-over-year declines in gross margin, since three consecutive quarters. Notably, unfavorable business mix and lower margins from Unified Grocers dented gross margin during the third quarter.  Estimates Trending DownFor fiscal 2018, management projects net earnings from continuing operations in the range of a loss of $20 million to earnings of $2 million. Management also expects adjusted EBITDA in a range of $475-$485 million, compared with the previous expectation of $475-$495 million. The narrowed view reflects the impact of greater-than-expected trucking and logistic expenses incurred in the Wholesale segment during the third quarter.Owing to such factors as well as the aforementioned hurdles pertaining to the retail segment, consensus estimate for the fourth quarter have declined 8 cents to reach 73 cents, since earnings announcement.Growth CatalystsNevertheless, SUPERVALU’s booming Wholesale business segment offers considerable strength to combat the aforementioned hurdles and keep the company afloat in the industry. Notably, sales from this segment improved 52% year over year to $2,888 million in third-quarter fiscal 2018, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. Thus, the company is on track to develop wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. Incidentally, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth quarter, which along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers (acquired in June 2017) underscores the company’s focus on solidifying Wholesale business.Further, SUPERVALU has been trying to improve performance and business effectiveness by focusing more on prospective areas, such as organic food products. The company has been evaluating the growth prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category. Apart from this, SUPERVALU also strives toward improving its omni-channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends. In this respect, the company recently agreed on a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards at its e-commerce sites.Bottom LineWhile SUPERVALU’s retail business continues to be pressurized, management is optimistic about the underlying growth of its Wholesale business and the strategies it is undertaking to fuel the same. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been working hard to achieve a turnaround in retail segment, through e-commerce innovations, new divisions and increased focus on private brands. We expect such dedicated efforts to boost the company’s performance in the forthcoming periods and thereby uplift investor’s confidence in the stock.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

82,CHD,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The company has been reeling under soft depletion trends due to persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. However, we remain confident about Boston Beer’s three-point growth plan focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands.A glimpse of the company’s earnings performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it has outpaced the estimates by an average positive surprise of 48.9%. Nevertheless, Boston Beer delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10.6% last quarter.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteAlthough the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the impending quarter remained stable in the last 30 days, the same reflects a year-over-year decline of 15.6%.So, let’s find out what’s in store for Boston Beer in the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.Things You Should KnowBoston Beer has been grappling with lower depletions and shipment volumes since last few quarters. In fact, volumes declined in all four quarters of 2017. Apparently, depletions fell 10% in the fourth quarter and 7% in 2017. Softness in depletion volumes mainly stems from the weakness in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands as well as soft hard cider category.Depletions for the year-to-date period through the six-week period ended Feb 10, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period. Despite a bullish shipments and depletions outlook for 2018, the company expects volumes to be sensitive to innovations that might hurt top and bottom lines. Evidently, lower shipment volumes along with decline in depletion volumes marred sales in the previous quarter. As a result, top line declined 6% year over year.  Also, industry-wide challenges related to general softening of the craft beer and hard cider categories as well as increased entry of start-up brewers might hurt the company’s performance.Nevertheless, Boston Beer’s growth plan that includes the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via its packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives is encouraging. Also, it recently launched new-media campaigns for the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands and remains optimistic about other new innovative product such as Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA. Further, management expects to sustain momentum for its Twisted Tea brand and gain leadership for Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand in the hard sparkling water category. Also, its cost-saving initiatives that led to margin expansion bode well.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $172.1 million, up 6.5% year over year. Moreover, the estimate for shipment volume is likely to increase 5% from the year-ago period.In the past three months, Boston Beer has gained 19.1% against the industry’s decline of 2.7%. Robust initiatives led to the stock's impressive performance.Given these mixed aspects, let’s wait and see whether the company’s initiatives sail it through soft depletions and shipment volumes or these concerns will continue to persist.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Boston Beer is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

84,CHD,"The consumer staples sector is often regarded as an abode of defensive stocks. It is one of the most trusted even when economic conditions are not congenial. Thus, adding stocks from this basket usually lends more stability to investors’ portfolio.We believe impressive labor market scenario and rising consumer confidence will benefit consumer staples stocks in the near future. Notably, Trump’s latest tax policy is anticipated to provide a big push to consumer goods companies and boost their investments.Among the numerous potential gainers, adding Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio will be a promising investment move at the moment.

The company’s organic sales inched up nearly 1% in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended January 2018) on the back of strong sales of these popular brands.Sound Marketing Moves: Hormel Foods expects that its near-term market share and aggregate sales will improve largely due to the company’s marketing initiatives. For instance, on Feb 26, the company launched the BE SMOOTH LIKE SKIPPY campaign in a bid to portray the deliciousness and smoothness of its peanut butter brand — SKIPPY. Through various videos, the campaign will showcase the recently-rolled out products under the brand, such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites.  Acquisitions: Hormel Foods intends to fortify its business on the back of well-planned business acquisitions.

The company believes implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (in December 2017) will largely reinforce its commercial competency. On grounds of lower tax rates, Hormel Foods anticipates to generate cash flow benefit within $100-$140 million in fiscal 2018.The company intends to fund new capital investments and provide higher returns to employees as well as shareholders with these proceeds.

85,CHD,"Investors often fail to think through sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking winning stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, betting on stocks completely depending on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued based on their revenues not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. In contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues. But superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Also, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in St. Petersburg, FL, Raymond James Financial, Inc.

86,CHD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Church & Dwight Company, Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.1% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CHD due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Church & Dwight Beats on Q4 Earnings, Guides for FY18Church & Dwight posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share were up 18.2% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.The company reported sales of $1,033.1 million that advanced 15.3% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,007 million.Organic sales rose 3.4%, which was ahead of the company’s guidance of 2.5%. The uptick was driven by better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. Further, organic sales were fueled by volumes growth of 4.3%.Adjusted gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 46.6% owing to gains from productivity programs, volume growth, and acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter excluded a prior-year Brazil charge. Adjusted operating margin also increased 90 bps to 20.8% driven by higher gross margin.Segment DetailsConsumer Domestic: Segment net sales were up 13.3% to $787.8 million and organic sales improved 2.7% benefiting from a 4% increase in volume, partly negated by a 1.3% negative impact from price. Volume gains in the quarter can be attributed to key product launches and increased personal care products sales.VITAFUSION adult gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH toothbrushes, ORAJEL oral analgesics, BATISTE dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER baking soda continued to be the main growth drivers.Consumer International: Segment net sales soared 33.3% to $170.1 million backed by recent acquisitions and broad-based sales growth for household and personal care products. Organic sales increased 5.8% driven by a 6% increase in volumes, partly mitigated by a 0.2% fall in price.STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada provided a major impetus to sales.Specialty Products: Sales at this segment improved 3% to $75.2 million. Organic sales advanced 5.1% backed by 2.8% higher volumes and favorable pricing (up 2.3%), mainly in the animal productivity business.Other Financial UpdatesChurch & Dwight ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $278.9 million, long-term debt of $2,103.4 million and total shareholders’ equity of $2,218 million.In 2017, the company generated cash flow from operations of $681.5 million and incurred capital expenditure of $45 million.Concurrently, management raised quarterly cash dividend to 21.75 cents per share, marking a 14% increase from the previous dividend rate of 19 cents. This brings the annualized dividend to 87 cents per share, raising the dividend payout to nearly $215 million. The increased dividend is payable on Mar 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as on Feb 15. This marks the company’s 22nd straight year of dividend increase. Moreover, the company has regularly paid dividend for 117 years.Guidance for 2018Innovations have been a key growth driver for Church & Dwight. As part of its long-term strategy to boost top and bottom lines, the company announced several new product launches in various categories.The company expects reported sales to grow about 8% and organic sales to rise 3% in 2018. Though recent acquisitions are anticipated to attract lower marketing, the company plans to increase spending to maintain marketing at nearly 12% of sales. Further, the company expects SG&A expenses to increase, as a percentage of sales, owing to lower intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions.As a result of the new tax reform, the company anticipates reduced tax burden. The effective tax rate is expected to be about 24-25% compared with 32% in 2017. Consequently, the company estimates earnings per share of $2.24-$2.28, reflecting adjusted earnings per share growth of 16-18%. However, reported earnings per share are expected to decline 21-23%. The company’s guidance assumes persistent business strength, a lower tax rate and reinvestment to accelerate growth, and other long-term objectives.Q1 OutlookFor first-quarter 2018, the company expects reported and organic sales growth of 11% and 2%, respectively. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents in the quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19.6%. Further, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to 17.3% increase.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

87,CHD,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc.’s (CHD  -  Free Report) stock has been moving up the charts, thanks to its focus on innovations which have also helped the company to put up an impressive past record. Well, this consumer products behemoth has gained 6.8% in the past three months, as against the industry’s dip of 0.3%. So, let’s take a closer view of the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on.Focus on Innovations, Solid Brand PortfolioThis developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products has a diversified portfolio with 11 power brands, including ARM & HAMMER, Trojan, OxiClean, Spinbrush, First Response, Nair, Orajel, Xtra, VMS, Water Pik and Batiste. The company’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future.Robust Acquisitions Bolster GrowthChurch & Dwight, which started with only one brand (ARM & HAMMER) has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These asset-light businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter of 2017 and is on track with its integration. The company's other recent acquisitions include Agro BioSciences in May and VIVISCAL business in January 2017. Prior to that, the acquisitions of ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson in December 2016 provided impetus to the company’s international business. Talking of international, let’s analyse the company’s Consumer International segment that remains its major growth driver.Consumer International Segment: A Major DriverChurch & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2% thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Impressive Past RecordChurch & Dwight’s third-quarter 2017 results marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, whereas sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 out of the last 14 quarters now. Results were backed by continued organic sales growth, which in turn was driven by higher volumes. Clearly, the company’s investment spending is paying off. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, Church & Dwight’s organic sales rose 3.2%, backed by growth in domestic sales, continued international business expansion and solid Specialty Products business growth. Management remains impressed with the broad-based growth and it also remains hopeful of achieving bottom-line growth of 8.5% in 2017.All said, we believe that Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of innovative products and aggressive productivity programs should keep driving its performance.Looking for More?

Though sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate after two consecutive beat, it improved year over year driven by strength in the International, Lifestyle and Cleaning segments on higher prices.For fiscal 2018, the company raised its earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $6.17-$6.37 from $5.47-$5.67 guided earlier.  It expects earnings per share to include 70-75 cents gain from the new tax reform, partly offset by lower gross margin. (Read: Clorox Beats on Q2 Earnings, Raises FY18 EPS View)Consequently, Clorox has witnessed solid upward earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has moved up 53 cents and 35 cents, respectively, to $6.23 and $6.55 in the said time period.What’s Ahead?Clorox remains keen on using the benefits from the tax reform to support long-term business growth as well as enhance shareholders’ returns. Apparently, it raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 14% to 96 cents per share from 84 cents, payable on May 11, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Apr 25.In addition, the company anticipates the new tax reform to boost its earnings and cash flows going forward. This was well reflected in the aforementioned guidance raise for fiscal 2018 earnings. Clorox also raised its long-term free cash flow target, under the 2020 Strategy. It now expects to generate free cash flow, as a percentage of sales, in the range of 11-13% (on a yearly basis) compared with 10-12% projected earlier.We believe Clorox is well placed for long-term growth backed by its 2020 Strategy, robust e-commerce and brand management initiatives, and maximizing shareholder’s value. These initiatives are likely to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares as well.Not Done Yet? Check These Trending Consumer Staples StocksThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

92,CHD,"Growing consumer preference for organic and natural food products has directed investor’s attention on companies such as United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report). Notably, the company has been riding on robust consumer demand across its sales channels along with sturdy growth initiatives. Courtesy of these factors, shares of this leading distributor of specialty food products have surged close to 27.9% in the past six months, comfortably outperforming the industry’’s rally of 4.6%.So, let’s delve deeper into United Natural Foods’ strategic endeavors and see if there’s more room for growth for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Expanding E-commerce CapabilitiesUnited Natural has been actively responding to consumers’ rising preference for online shopping. To this end, the company strives to strengthen e-commerce space by investing in technology and infrastructure. Owing to such efforts, e-commerce sales jumped more than 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein the food service e-commerce sales recorded highest quarter of year-over-year growth. Further, United Natural’s efforts to expand online operations have encouraged management to project robust opportunities in this space in fiscal 2018. Efforts to Widen Network and PortfolioUnited Natural has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to enhance brand portfolio, distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In this regard, buyouts of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru in 2016 have proved to be lucrative, as they have been driving top-line growth. The Gourmet Guru deal helped the company in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands. It also expanded United Natural’s presence in key urban markets. The acquisition of Haddon House provided greater operating scale and resources to augment product and service offerings.Other notable buyouts include Nor-Cal Produce, Inc (in 2016), Tony’s Fine Foods (in 2014) and Trudeau Distributing Company (in 2013). Further, we believe that United Natural will continue boosting portfolio and business reach through such strategic acquisitions.Focus on Organic food productsUnited Natural commands a strong line-up of organic and specialty food products in the United States and Canada. In the face of rising demand in the specialty foods market, the company has accelerated distribution of specialty food items including ethnic, kosher and gourmet products and have expanded into a number of high-growth business markets. This has not only allowed the company to capture market share but also provided an opportunity to conduct business with a number of conventional supermarkets.Robust OutlookDriven by the aforementioned strategic efforts, United Natural delivered a stellar start to fiscal 2018, wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. During the first-quarter conference call, management stated that it continued to witness record sales and shipping unit volumes in the second quarter. For fiscal 2018, management continues to be committed toward achieving core strategic objectives, including plans to enhance customer base, improve gross margin and broaden distribution channel by adding new products and businesses.Encouraged by these factors, management also raised its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018. United Natural expects net sales for fiscal 2018 to grow in the range of 6.2-7.8%, while earnings are expected to increase in the range of 6.3-9.4%.All said, the company is likely to continue with its sturdy performance and be in investors’ good books.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?
