7,MTD,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
8,MTD,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

The Russell Small Cap Index (RTY)  has been unable to recover - having broken all 3 key technical supports and is now challenging the November lows - right here at 1145 -  and now looking at a 'black hole' which could cause it to revisit the October lows of 1085...or a 5% move lower from here....which would represent an 11% ytd decline - if that happens.  So look - it ain't pretty right now....which makes us wonder what data sets is the FED using to gauge real economic activity and sentiment?   Job Growth?  Really?  As the threat of a recession looms large, we will see the 'flight to safety' trade....the large cap, solid dividend paying listed companies  will be the 'safe haven' (or safer haven)  trade as a defensive maneuver by large institutions to weather the storm of the approaching hurricane...After falling nearly every day in December,  the mkt is now oversold and that would suggest a bounce ahead as the mkt tries to find its footing.  And this morning US Futures are fighting to move higher.....At 5 am they were ahead by  10 pts and now at 7 am they are only up 6 pts......as they battle to stay in positive territory......Keep your eyes on 2032......a breach here will ignite the algos - sell side orders will hit the mkt while the buyers retreat......I mean - why would you  stand in front of a moving train?  (Barring the obvious answer!) Overnight global mkts continue to fall....in Asia - Japan is at a 1 month low falling 1.32%, Hong Kong lost 0.45%, China -0.50% and ASX -0.84%.    In Europe - mkts continue to bleed as the rout in oil and other commodities as well as weakness in Asia rip the wound wide open......never allowing it to scab over..... Economically, there was more bad inflation data from Europe.  French CPI was flat yoy vs. (E) 0.2%, further justifying the ECB’s QE expansion last week while providing a reason for even more...FED policy, a stronger dollar and broader macro concerns continue to be the story.   FTSE -0.47%, CAC 40 0.145%, DAX  -0.16%, Eurostoxx -0.32%, Spain  -0.08% and Italy  -0.07%. There are no mkt moving eco stats today at all.....so expect the focus to be on the Oil story and the FED story.....If the bottom falls out before next Tuesday - Will that cause the FED to 're-think' it's  'strong economy' story????  I'm just sayin'.....Take good care - KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

Revenue rose 4% to $684.3 million, more than $10 million better than estimates. The company added a nickel to its 2014 EPS guidance, now $11.40 to $11.60 vs. $10.58 last year. Revenue was guided to grow 3% to 4% this year.""The clear highlight was growth outperformance in Europe (boosted by easy comps),"" wrote analyst Ross Muken of ISI Group in a note late Wednesday. ""From a segment perspective, better-than-expected Lab results (strength in Asia and EU) and a return to growth in Industrials ... counteracted revenue declines in Food Retailing.""Muken added a buck to his price target, now 253, and maintained his neutral rating. UBS analyst Daniel Arias upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, lifting his price target to 263 from 245. In midday trading Thursday, shares were around 248.Mettler-Toledo's report continued a pretty good earnings season for the Electronics-Scientific/Measuring group. Danaher (DHR) and Waters (WAT) both gained after beating Q4 estimates, though the stocks have since retreated in the larger market selloff.

335,MTD,"When management decides to merge or acquire another company they tend to see all the potential positive impacts the move will bring to the bigger company, but a perfect acquisition rarely occurs.  This is the situation facing our Zacks Bear of the Day, MTS Systems Corp (MTSC  -  Free Report) who saw a negative impact on their EPS due to their recent integration.  This Zacks Ranked #5 (Strong Sell) is a leading global supplier of test systems and industrial position sensors. The Company's testing hardware and software solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development, and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products, and structures. MTS' high-performance position sensors provide controls for a variety of industrial and vehicular applications.Recent Earnings ReportOn April 10th management reported FY 16, and Q1 17 earnings and revenue results where they missed the Zacks consensus earnings estimate, but beat the Zacks consensus revenue estimate.  In the quarter the company saw year over year changes in Revenues +42%, on stronger than expected organic revenue growth.  EPS fell by -29.5% when compared to the year earlier due to a -$0.46 negative impact from acquisition integration.  The company was also negatively affected by violations of the company’s Code of Conduct by some employees.  This investigation resulted in no loss of intellectual property theft, and caused management to create a new Chief Risk and Compliance Officer.  Lastly, management admitted that their PCB acquisitions’ cost and restructuring expenses will have a negative impact on their FY 2017 results.  FY 2017 GuidanceDuring the earnings report, management gave updated guidance for FY 2017, and both EPS and revenue were below the Zacks expectations.  Management guided EPS in a range between $1.67 and $2.15, well below the Zacks consensus estimate of $2.82.  Moreover, management adjusted FY 2017 revenue guidance to a range between $760 million and $790 million, well below the previous estimate of $809 million.  Management’s TakeDr. Jeffrey A. Graves, President and Chief Executive Officer of MTS Systems commented on their recent results and 2017 outlook stating, “With regard to the business performance and the PCB acquisition that closed in July 2016, fiscal year 2016 ended on a strong note with overall double digit revenue growth that extended into the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The integration of PCB is progressing as anticipated, and we remain excited about the products and capabilities added to the company, and the revenue and cost synergies we expect to realize from the combination. While the integration costs and restructuring expenses did have a negative impact on our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings and will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 results, we believe the Test and Sensors businesses are more complementary than ever before and will deliver greater value to our shareholders for years to come.”Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see from the chart below, after almost 2 years of declines, the company saw an uptick in early 2017, but the 2017 guidance caused the stock to fall once again.MTS Systems Corporation Price and Consensus MTS Systems Corporation Price and Consensus | MTS Systems Corporation QuoteDeclining Future Earnings EstimatesOver the past 30 days earnings estimates for Q2 17, Q3 17, FY 17 and FY 18 have all seen significant declines; Q2 17 fell from $0.58 to $0.48, Q3 17 dropped from $0.74 to $0.49, FY 17 slipped from $2.59 to $2.13, and FY 18 plummeted from $3.48 to $2.63Bottom LineMerging a new acquisition into your current operations is typically not an easy task, and it appears as though management will continue to have difficulty with this task.  Unfortunately, this merging will have a negative impact through 2017.  Therefore, it would be prudent to wait till these issues are past, and the company can more focus on core items.  If you are inclined to invest in the Scientific Instruments sector you would be best served by looking into Mettler-Toledo Intl (MTD  -  Free Report) which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

337,MTD,"Industry Rank Analysis 2-15-11 
"
338,MTD,"I have written about this group before in this column, but they still look good. We currently have a ten-way tie for first place in the Zacks Industry Rank. Five of those are either semiconductor firms, or the firms that make the gear to make semiconductors.
"
339,MTD,"None of these “industries are all that big based on the number of firms. The largest is the semi-equipment/wafer fabrication industry, with eight firms; the other four “industries all have either one or two firms in them. Each of these industries has an average Zacks rank of 2.00.
"
340,MTD,"In addition to the five semi and semi-equipment “industries"" in the tie for first place, two other related industries also show up well. The scientific instruments industry (lots of scientific instruments are used in the production of semiconductors) and the electronic test equipment industry (the chips all have to be tested before they are shipped) also show up very well in the industry rank, the instruments in 13th place with an average score of 2.18 and the test equipment industry in 19th place with an average score of 2.29.
"
341,MTD,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list.
"
342,MTD,"The same holds true for the bottom of the list. It is even more interesting when you have three large industries, all from the same area, that are clustered together near the top or the bottom. The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the “industry.  
"
343,MTD,"Semiconductors are essentially the raw material/basic building blocks for all technology. Not just the obvious tech things like computers and smart phones, but chips find their way into almost every manufactured product today. Your average compact car today has more computing power embedded in it than did the Apollo 11 space capsule. The strength of the semiconductor industry on the Zacks rank is thus a very hopeful sign for the economy, both here and overseas.
"
344,MTD,"The first table semiconductor and related stocks that hold the vaunted Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). The second table shows the Zacks #2 Ranked (Buy) firms. Most of the stocks are small caps, and even micro caps. There is a fair representation of mid cap stocks as well, and two large caps, so there should be something for everybody, at least in terms of company size.
"
345,MTD,"Valuations are a bit on the high side based on current fiscal year earnings (mostly 2011) but if you are willing to look out to next year, become much more reasonable.Number 1 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceAsml Holding Nv ASML $18,962  10.6 11.64 22.43% 33.57% $43.54 Natl Instrs Cp NATI $3,644  27.17 22.91 7.30% 7.30% $46.59 Varian Semi VSEA $3,373  11.22 11.13 27.27% 19.55% $45.60 Teradyne Inc TER $3,269  10.3 8.94 26.76% 23.62% $18.02 Intl Rectifier IRF $2,290  16.1 14.34 16.48% 15.07% $33.00 Coherent Inc COHR $1,478  19.86 17.54 21.68% 23.90% $59.03 Fei Company FEIC $1,206  17.51 15.08 24.90% 28.72% $31.54 Mts Systems MTSC $672  18.24 16.95 22.37% 17.02% $43.90 Adv Energy Inds AEIS $664  9.94 8.17 1.23% 0.25% $15.34 Caliper Life Sc CALP $335  285 55.42 N/A 60.00% $6.65 Number 2 Ranked StocksCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceTaiwan Semi-Adr TSM $67,047  12.66 12.88 1.39% 8.06% $12.94 Ametek Inc AME $6,996  21 18.47 1.79% 1.53% $43.71 Mettler-Toledo MTD $5,485  21.52 19.31 3.06% 2.43% $167.11 Bruker Corp BRKR $3,084  20.85 17.62 1.70% 1.92% $18.71 Ezchip Semi Ltd EZCH $754  25.21 16.04 5.78% N/A $30.00 Newport Corp NEWP $619  12.71 12.34 6.79% 13.75% $16.85 Photronics Inc PLAB $454  14.3 12.99 7.31% 0.00% $8.40 Measuremnt Spcl MEAS $424  16.52 14.32 1.15% 2.27% $29.00 Iris Intl Inc IRIS $188  30.17 27.26 0.00% 0.00% $10.36 
"
346,MTD,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
347,MTD,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
348,MTD,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
349,MTD,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

351,MTD,"Key Points - Update:
"
352,MTD,"Demand for industrial products remains good, despite the sluggish economy
"
353,MTD,"Several industrial product companies have customers in sectors not significantly hurt by the credit crunch
"
354,MTD,"Second-quarter results for industrial product companies aided by stronger economic growth abroad and the weaker dollar
"
355,MTD,"Despite the sluggish economy, many industrial product companies are continuing to enjoy growth. There are two primary reasons for this:
"
356,MTD," The first is that many of these companies have exposure to sectors that have not been significantly hurt by the U.S. economic slowdown, such as energy, food, scientific research and utility.
"
357,MTD," The second is international sales. Most countries in Europe and Asia are experiencing stronger growth than the U.S. Furthermore, the weak dollar makes U.S. products more price competitive to overseas customers. And, as sales conducted overseas are translated back into dollars, a gain is realized. This is because each euro is worth about $1.55 in U.S. dollars.
"
358,MTD,"These two factors have allowed several industrial product companies to both report strong second-quarter reports and raise their full-year guidance, including Cooper Industries (CBE), Mettler-Toledo (MTD  -  Free Report) and Woodward Governor (WGOV).
"
359,MTD,"An Electric Quarter For Cooper Industries
"
360,MTD,"Cooper Industries, which makes electrical and circuit protection products as well as hand tools, earned 97 cents per share in the second quarter, on an adjusted basis, versus 78 cents a year prior. Brokerage analysts had expected profits to total 92 cents.
"
361,MTD,"Revenues rose 18% to $1.72 billion, reflecting organic growth, the positive impact of acquisitions and the weak dollar.
"
362,MTD,"The company's Electrical Products segment was particularly strong, with sales increasing 19%. Strong demand from the industrial, utility and energy markets all played favorable roles.
"
363,MTD,"Citing the positive business momentum, CBE raised its full-year guidance to between $3.61 and $3.71 per share. Nearly all of the 9 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to $3.62 per share.
"
364,MTD,"Mettler-Toledo Profits Measure Up
"
365,MTD,"Mettler-Toledo credited its broad customer base for propelling revenues 20%. The company, which makes weighing and laboratory analytical instruments, saw sales reach $515.6 million, versus $430.5 million a year prior. Per share earnings totaled $1.38 per share, 29% above last year's level and 10 cents better than the consensus earnings estimate.
"
366,MTD,"MTD generated double-digit growth in its laboratory, industrial and retail segments. A weak dollar helped boost demand internationally and contributed to the overall growth.
"
367,MTD,"The company increased its full-year EPS guidance by 10 cents to a range of $5.53 and $5.63 per share. Positive revisions from 6 of the 7 covering brokerage analysts caused the consensus earnings estimate to rise 10 cents to $5.63 per share.
"
368,MTD,"Woodward Governor Blows Past Expectations
"
369,MTD,"Woodward Governor, which makes power systems, saw fiscal third-quarter sales rise 23% to $329.8 million. WGOV's Electrical Power Systems unit was a key drive, with growth coming from the power generation and wind turbine inverter markets. The company also enjoyed double-digit growth in its larger turbine and engine systems units.
"
370,MTD,"The sales growth translated into second-quarter profits of 47 cents per share, a sharp increase over year-prior results of 34 cents. Brokerage analysts had forecast 44 cents.
"
371,MTD,"Based on the results, CEO Thomas Gendron raised his full-year EPS guidance to $1.75 per share, seven higher than the consensus estimate.
"
372,MTD,"Not only did nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raise their profit projections for fiscal 2008 in response, they also raised their projections for fiscal 2009. The consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2008 now stands at $1.75 per share. The consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2009 is now $2.04, 7 cents above the average forecast of a week ago.
"
373,MTD,"Industry Groups

374,MTD,"CBE is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock and is classified in Machinery-General Industrial. This group contains three Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks: Graftech (GTI), Metsco (MXCYY  -  Free Report) and Nordson (NDSN  -  Free Report).

"
381,MTD,"This weeks screen isnt so much a screen, but rather a look at how using a market sentiment item can help find new stock picks. 
"
382,MTD,"The item is called the short ratio. 
"
383,MTD,"The short ratio is the number of shares sold short (short interest or bets that the stock will go lower in price) divided by the average daily volume. This is sometimes referred to as the ""days to cover"" ratio because it tells approximately how many days it will take short-sellers to cover their positions if good news sends the price higher. 
"
384,MTD,"The higher the ratio, the longer it would take to buy back the sold (borrowed) shares. And in theory, the more short positions there are to cover, the stronger the short covering rally would be. 
"
385,MTD,"Many people who use this indicator like to look for the number of days to cover to be higher than 8-10 days. Its generally believed that a short ratio of that size could prove difficult to cover and therefore trigger a strong rally on any hint of an upswing. (My personal preference is to take that into consideration, but also compare it to the industrys average ratio and the stocks own historical ratio.) 
"
386,MTD,"And while I wouldnt recommend using just the short ratio, I do think it can be a great tool for helping define great opportunities. 
"
387,MTD,"For example, sometimes when Im looking for stocks that have been in a lengthy consolidation, Ill look for those stocks with high short ratios.  
"
388,MTD,"Why? 
"
389,MTD,"Because consolidation ranges are basically areas of market indecision.
"
390,MTD,"Bets are being made by both bullish and bearish investors. So finding stocks that are going back and forth near their price highs with a growing short ratio shows that ever-increasing bets are being made on prices going lower. 
"
391,MTD,"However, if the stock breaks out to the upside, properly positioned bulls will more than likely add to their winnings; undecided traders will now be convinced to get long; and shorts will have to scramble to cover their bearish bets. This can be an explosive situation.    
"
392,MTD,"This can be used quite effectively for bottom fishing too. 
"
393,MTD,"When a stock is getting battered and pundits are wrangling over whether its the bottom or not, you should pay close attention to the short ratio. 
"
394,MTD,"Of course, there has to be a reason for a stock to move higher. So seeing an improving fundamental outlook is important.  
"
395,MTD,"But when lopsided market sentiment seems to be at its worst (reflected in investors buying and selling) the short ratio can be just the thing to uncover extremes.   
"
396,MTD,"For beaten down stocks, you can search for companies near their 52 week lows with increasing short ratios. Or better yet, look for short ratios above their average values or even ones that are at (or near) their historical highs.  
"
397,MTD,"For stocks moving higher, try looking for historically high short ratios for stocks up 20% or more (new uptrend) or that have just rallied past an important moving average like the 50 or 200-day average. (Funds will often pile in at those points. So a large short ratio could propel the market significantly higher as huge buyers bid the market up while panicky shorts chase it even higher just to get out.) 
"
398,MTD,"A screen Im currently running, however, is not a bottom picking screen. In fact, its looking for stocks in solid uptrends. The parameters to this weeks screen are:  Up 20% or greater over the last 12 weeks.  Trading within 10% of their 52 week high.  With upward earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter over the last 4 weeks.  All of this is added to companies trading over $5.  And that have an average daily trading volume of at least 50,000 shares or more. 
"
399,MTD,"Here are three of the companies that made the list this week (11/26/07): AIRM Air Methods Corp. DM Dolan Media Company (MTD  -  Free Report) Mettler-Toledo International 
"
400,MTD,"Try using the short ratio in some of your current screens and see if it doesnt give you a greater edge and keener insight into whats really happening in your stocks.  
"
401,MTD,"This item isnt available in all screeners (especially the historical values and industry values), but it is available in the Research Wizard. 
"
402,MTD,"And remember the key to successful screening is in discovering those screens that have produced profitable results in the past. Thats exactly what you get with the powerful Screening and Backtesting ability of the  Research Wizard   Disclosure: Officers, directors and/or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and/or hold long and/or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material.

403,MTD,"The Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry is benefiting from strong end-market demand, particularly from life science, pharmaceutical and academic markets. Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is also driving growth for the scientific tool and apparatus providers.The growth prospect of the Instruments - Scientific industry is quite bright in the near term given rising spending by the government and academic labs. The $3-billion increase in the National Institute of Health (NIH) budget for fiscal 2018 also bodes well for this industry.Moreover, socio-economic factors like aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are driving demand for scientific measurement solutions.Additionally, continued innovation by pharma companies that are increasingly focusing on large molecule therapies, which demand more analytical measurement content, is positive for the Instruments - Scientific industry participants.Further, the industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India, which are growing much faster than the United States.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsHowever, looking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the ongoing trade tension between the United States and China has been dampening the sentiment of investors in the Instruments - Scientific industry.The Zacks Instruments - Scientific Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively climbed 0.8%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.2% and 16.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Performance Stretched Valuation a ConcernMoreover, the Instruments - Scientific industry’s valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 21.29, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.11 and the median level is 18.29.Price/ Earnings Forward 12 Months Moreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.52 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Instruments - Scientific Industry’s respective ratios.Price/Earnings Forward 12 Months Underperformance May Continue Due to Dim Earnings OutlookThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China are expected to hurt shareholder returns in the near term. Notably, most of the companies that form the Instruments – Scientific industry have significant exposure to China.However, what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the Instruments - Scientific industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance.Price and Consensus: Zacks Instruments - Scientific Industry This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $4.30 EPS estimate for the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in it, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the EPS of the industry for 2018, but how this projection has evolved recently.As you can see here, the $4.30 EPS estimate for 2018 has remained steady from the end of April, but increased from $4.26 at the end of March. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry have been proactive in raising their estimates.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #70, which places it at the top 27% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Long-Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has increased since mid-October 2017 to reach the current level of 11.39%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate Instruments – Scientific industry’s long-term growth prospects are alluring. Demand for instruments and analytical measurement tools is expected to remain strong primarily due to strong growth in worldwide healthcare spending.Pharma companies are focusing on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics, biopharma and applied, microbiology and diagnostics and neuroscience and cell microscopy, which present significant growth opportunity for the industry participants.Moreover, the growth prospect in China is huge as regulators are attempting to upgrade the Chinese biopharma industry to global standards, resulting in strong demand for instruments.These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016. Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin.  Bottom LineWe believe strong growth prospects in emerging markets, increasing spending on healthcare driven by an aging demography and continued innovation in the pharma and life science end-market are key catalysts for this industry.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Instruments - Scientific industry based on the above-mentioned factors.Currently, none of the stocks in the Instruments – Scientific industry sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, there are few stocks that investors can hold on to given the positive fundamentals and strong long-term growth prospects of the industry.Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) - Milford, MA-based Waters carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 8.7% over the past year. The consensus EPS estimate for the company has remained steady at $8.21 for the current year, over the last 30 days.Price and Consensus: WAT Mettler-Toledo International (MTD  -  Free Report) - Headquartered in Polaris Parkway, Columbus, the weighing instruments provider also has a Zacks Rank #3. Its shares have lost 2.7% over the past year. Moreover, the consensus EPS estimate for the company has remained steady at $20.25 for the current year, over the last 30 days.Price and Consensus: MTD PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) - Headquartered in Waltham, MA, this Zacks Rank #3 stock has gained 9.1% over the past year.

404,MTD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. (MTD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MTD due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsMettler-Toledo International, Inc. reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $3.74 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents but came ahead of the management’s guided range of $3.65-$3.70 per share. The figure increased 12% on a year-over-year basis but decreased 37.3% sequentially.Net sales of $660.8 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $651.1 million and were up 11.1% year over year but down 15.1% from the previous quarter. In local currency, sales grew 5%, which was in line with the management’s expectation of 5% growth. Further, favorable exchange rate contributed 6% to the year-over-year growthThe top-line growth was driven by robust performance of Laboratory business across all the geographies and benefits from Biotix acquisition. Also, Mettler-Toledo performed well in China which propelled the growth further.Top Line in DetailBy Segments: The company reports in three segments — Laboratory Instruments, Industrial Instruments and Food Retail Weighing Solutions.Laboratory Segment: This segment accounted for 52% of net sales in the reported quarter. The company witnessed 10% sales growth on a year-over-year basis, which was driven by strong instrument portfolio. Especially balances, auto-chem and process analytics instruments performed well. Further, Field Turbo investments, marketing initiatives and improving Spinnaker sales also contributed to sales growth in this segment. Moreover, acquisition of Biotix benefited the segment.Industrial Segment: The company generated 40% of net sales from this segment although revenues dipped by 1% year over year in the first quarter. Sales in this segment were down due to weak performances of product inspection business which declined mid-single digit and core industrial business which also fell low-single digit. Product inspection business suffered in this quarter from shifting of U.S. inspection unit to Tampa and implementation of new ERP system in German inspection operations.

In local currency, sales grew 6%, which was better than management’s expectation of 5.5% growth. In the quarter, reported sales increased 10%, of which 4% was attributed to favorable foreign exchange rate.The better-than-expected results were driven by strong growth across Laboratory and Industrial segments in all regions. Mettler-Toledo’s strong product pipeline along with Field Turbo investments, marketing initiatives and Spinnaker sales contributed to its results.In the last quarter, Mettler-Toledo acquired Biotix, a manufacturer and distributor of laboratory consumables and liquid handling solutions to the life science market.

416,MTD,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 12 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings once last year. In third-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive streak, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%.The bottom-line figure fared much better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 12.7% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.57. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 7% year over year to $566 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.6 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 6% year over year) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 7% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 15% growth in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 8% and 6%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 7% and 20% growth, respectively. However, sales in the Americas continued to reflect weakness and remained flat year over year.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $135.2 million, up from $123.9 million incurred in third-quarter 2016. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $33.8 million compared with $30.4 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter climbed 4.8% year over year to $159 million.Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteLiquidityWaters Corp.’s cash, cash equivalents and investments at the quarter end amounted to $3.3 billion, higher than the $2.81 billion recorded as on Dec 31, 2016. The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.53 billion from $2.36 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business started 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum, going ahead. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader sector include MAM Software Group, Inc. (MAMS  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. (MTD  -  Free Report).

In second-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive streak, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 by 2.3%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.58. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Asia, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 4% year over year to $558 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.9 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 7% on a constant currency basis) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 4% on a constant currency basis). The momentum was further aided by growth of 5% (on a constant currency basis) in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales grew 5% and 3%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 14% and 5% growth, respectively, at constant currency.

The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.48 billion from $2.36 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a strong revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business started 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum, going ahead. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business, moving ahead.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other similarly-ranked stocks in the same space include Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report), Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.
