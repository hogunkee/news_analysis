0,L,"Former President Barack Obama is swaggering around and claiming he didn't really have any scandals as president. In February, he said we ""didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" This only means shamelessness can seem like a winning tactic. In May, he said, ""I didn't have scandals, which seems like it shouldn't be something you brag about.""By any objective measure, this man is a liar.Obama can claim he was only following the lead of his servile press corps. CNN, which screams about Donald Trump scandals all day long, ran a two-hour Obama special at the end of his second term during which host Fareed Zakaria claimed: ""He ran an administration that was largely scandal-free. ... And he did it all the while under a microscope — because he looked different.""This man is a liar as well. There's no other way to put it.So when the Justice Department inspector general released a report on the Hillary Clinton email scandal on June 14, it's not surprising that the network newscasts ignored any reference to Obama, who is certainly scolded in the report, including pages 66 to 69.ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS did multiple segments on the IG report, and all of them completely skipped an Obama angle. They centered their coverage on how the IG scalded former FBI Director James Comey, and they ignored that Comey was appointed by ... who? Obama in 2013.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThese networks also skipped over the report's discussion of the scandal of then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac shortly before the Justice Department announced it would not prosecute. Naturally, in their liberal eyes, the scandal here was that President Trump was claiming he was vindicated by the IG report. This was apparently the false statement.Obama can lie without any consequences. For starters, in 2015 he denied knowing that Hillary Clinton used a private email address for her government business. The IG report makes clear that Obama ""was one of the 13 individuals with whom Clinton had direct contact using her clintonemail.com account."" As he so often did during eight years of assorted scandals, Obama claimed he only learned about it ""through news reports."" No one called him a) dishonest or b) clueless.But it was worse than that. Obama caused indigestion inside the FBI when he went on television and insisted nothing Clinton did was worth prosecuting.On ""60 Minutes"" on Oct. 11, 2015, Obama insisted, ""I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered."" CBS' Steve Kroft nudged him, saying, ""This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers."" Obama replied: ""there's no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We don't get an impression that here there was purposely efforts ... to hide something or to squirrel away information.""Lynch told the IG that Obama stepped in it by prematurely proclaiming on CBS that there was no national security damage. It created a suspicion of political bias at the top of the Justice Department. Obama repeated his line about Clinton's lack of harm to national security in a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview on April 10, 2016.It's not like the networks couldn't find these video clips. As energetically as they create a persistent ""crisis"" for Donald Trump, they have put a protective bubble around their precious Obama. He can boast that he has no scandals because the ""facts first"" media have manufactured that false perception for 10 years.Hillary Clinton email scandal explained.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1,L,"CNN host Van Jones, a former Obama White House aide, interviewed NBC late-night host Seth Meyers with the usual reverence that liberals offer to comedians of the Resistance. ""You're an icon. You're a legend,"" Jones gushed. ""You're doing a phenomenal service to the country.""But the best comedy in this interview came when Jones asked about the jesters lining up against President Trump.""You are really tough on him. A lot of the late-night folks are really tough on him,"" Jones acknowledged. ""Do you feel that the red-state folks have a legitimate complaint when they say all these late-night guys are just a, you know, attack squad against the president and there's no diversity there when it comes to ideological diversity or fairness?""Next he'll wonder if CNN has an issue with Trump, too.Meyers started with a who-needs-ratings answer: ""Look. I can understand that they don't like it. And I certainly respect their opinion to choose not to watch."" In other words, this show isn't really performed for anyone other than disgruntled liberals who think they're living in hell.Then came the line that makes you reach for a drug test: ""With that said, most comedians are pretty consistent in calling out hypocrisy and lying. I don't think, you know, we don't every day just say, 'Hey, we got to attack Donald Trump. What is there?' It's the opposite. The thing comes first, and then we realize in order to talk about it is to, in some degree, to attack Donald Trump.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

What we remember is comedians rolling out the red carpet to honor her. Women at Comedy Central nearly fainted in her presence as she winked at them.Then there is Meyers, who helpfully loaned his star power to the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in 2014. He announced: ""President Clinton is here! And so is Bill!"" The Washington Post later reported, ""Bill grinned and applauded from the audience.""Meyers the Merciless really let them have it for their hypocrisy and lying.In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine, Meyers nominated Hillary Clinton for the GQ ""100 Hottest Women of the 21st Century."" He told the magazine: ""I think somebody who is getting sexier every year is Hillary Clinton. Every year she seems better at whatever she's doing.""In April 2015, Meyers took on Peter Schweizer's book ""Clinton Cash"" on his show, saying, ""It's certainly fair to raise questions about the donations to the Clinton Foundation, but it's also fair to be suspicious of the cottage industry of anti-Clinton books that come out every year."" As if he's not part of a ""cottage industry"" of anti-Trump comedians?He didn't mention his own Clinton Foundation gig from the year before. He then suggested the anti-Clinton books wouldn't be damaging. ""She's been attacked for 25 years. It's possible she's built up an immunity to everything,"" he said. The liberal audience laughed. ""At this point, she could walk into Disneyland, lick the handrails at Space Mountain and walk out with a clean bill of health.""When Jones asked how he can still ""find the funny,"" Meyers was more honest about his personal Resistance: ""if you can point out how insane it all is, I think that helps keep you sane and keeps bringing you back. ... If you take a few days off criticizing what the president does, I feel like maybe that means he wins, and I don't want somebody to be so abnormal and have them win by us ignoring it.""Trump. Must.

2,L,"A growing chorus of prophets and pundits has been proclaiming the death of the American coal industry. After all, more than 250 coal-fired power plants have been retired since 2010 with several dozen others slated for closure within the next year. (We now generate more electricity from natural gas than from coal).Domestic coal production dropped from 1.2 billion short tons in 2008 to 773 million last year while industry employment, at 52,000 today, is down nearly 40% from a decade ago.But maybe it's premature to publish the industry's obituary. In 2017, coal production was up 45 million tons, the largest year-over-year increase since 2001, with growth recorded in each of the five major coal-producing regions. The largest regional increase was in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, where production jumped 8%.Even though U.S. coal consumption declined slightly last year, exports jumped 58% from 2016 driven by a weaker dollar, lower production costs, and rising demand in Asia and Europe. Coal prices across the U.S. rose as well, especially for Central Appalachian coal. Mining employment is also up slightly, about 1,500 from a year ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo is this a one-off, or is the coal industry on a sustainable rebound?Unquestionably, the use of coal for power generation here in the U.S. will continue to decline in the face of cheap natural gas and subsidies for renewables like wind and solar, even if President Obama's clean power plan should be rescinded. But globally, the outlook is much different.Recent forecasts by both the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy and the Paris-based International Energy Agency show the world's demand for coal growing steadily, especially for power generation, at least until 2040. Though environmentalists despair at this reality, it offers tremendous export opportunities for America's coal industry.And it's not just fast-growing economies like China, India and Indonesia where coal use is projected to rise. Japan is building dozens of new coal-fired plants to replace nuclear facilities closed after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Cloud Peak Energy, a company that mines in the Power River Basin, recently signed a multiyear contract to supply its coal Tokyo Electric Power Company.Germany, planning to shutter all its nuclear plants by 2022 while achieving 45% renewable energy by 2030, is also building coals plants in an effort to improve grid reliability and bring down some of the highest electricity prices in the world, a major concern for that country's export-oriented manufacturing industries. Though Germany possesses abundant supplies of high-CO2 lignite, it is relying on cleaner coal from countries like the U.S. for its new power plants.China has also re-emerged as an importer of U.S. coal, which is much cleaner than their domestic variety.The development and deployment of advanced technologies that reduce pollution and CO2 emissions also bode well for the future of coal, especially if these technologies are adopted abroad. High efficiency, low emission (HELE) plants with carbon capture are commercially available and have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the entire power sector by 20%. Pulverized coal combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle systems can reduce CO2 emissions by 25% compared with conventional coal plants.Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) has also become a commercial reality. As one example, the Parish Coal-Fired Generating Plant southwest of Houston that began operations last year is capturing 1.6 million tons of CO2 annually and shipping it via pipeline to oil fields where it's used for enhanced recovery. A Mississippi power plant burning lignite is also capturing CO2 and selling it to oil companies.So let's not write off America's coal producers. Export opportunities abound since coal will remain the world's primary fuel for power generation for decades to come. At the same time, the U.S. can become the global leader in HELE and CCUS, thereby contributing greatly to emissions reductions both here and abroad.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

3,L,"The late-night hosts hate President Donald Trump, so the idea that they would make friendly alliances shouldn't be shocking. But as we've come to understand, in today's world anything that reflects negatively on this president becomes ""news."" So when Stephen Colbert at CBS called up Jimmy Fallon at NBC and Conan O'Brien at TBS for a joint mockery of Trump, the liberal media jazzed up its importance.Vanity Fair called it a ""Historic Group Chat,"" as if these were world leaders in arms negotiations. Entertainment Weekly hyped them as superheroes engaging in an ""Avengers-esque collaboration."" CNN senior media reporter Brian Stelter led his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter with the headline ""Late night collusion!""This underlines how liberals elevate late-night comedians and ""Saturday Night Live"" satirists as the smartest, greatest Americans, an honor they don't deserve.
"
4,L,"The ""cold open"" that Colbert and Fallon presented on their shows was, as usual, a lame series of references to insults President Trump had issued. At a Monday-night rally in South Carolina, he called Colbert a ""lowlife"" and Fallon a ""lost soul."" Colbert and Fallon greeted each other with these insults.Oh, how touchy these comedians are when the tables are turned, where Colbert acting like a ""lowlife"" registers as a really serious insult. This is the same Colbert who ranted last year that Trump is the ""presi-dunce"" and ""prick-tator"" and speaks ""like a sign-language gorilla who got hit in the head.""

""Choking up,"" the Reporter writes, Fallon said: ""I heard you. You made me feel bad. So now what? Are you happy? I'm depressed. Do you want to push me more? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself?""Comedians are expected to do the left's bidding like pop-culture guerrillas. The agitators apparently driving Fallon to brink of suicide threats never minded when Fallon fawned all over Hillary Clinton.In 2012, he hosted then-President Obama for a segment of ""Slow Jam the News"" during which he let Obama push his agenda and then endorsed it, saying: ""Awww, yeah. You should listen to the president, or as I like to call him, the preezy of the United Steezy."" In 2013, Fallon dressed up as a woman and partnered with then-first lady Michelle Obama for a skit called the ""Evolution of Mom Dancing.""All is apparently right with the world when the networks work overtime to confirm the ""effortless"" coolness of Democratic leaders. But Republicans can never be normalized or humanized by late-night hosts.When Johnny Carson mocked President Ronald Reagan, it was gentle and had a ""just kidding"" vibe. All these years later, the left expects late-night comedians to lead a vicious campaign of character assassination to ruin Trump, which is why Fallon's hair mussing gets metaphorically reimagined as treason.Other columns by L.

5,L,"The ""news"" you see at night on broadcast television is defined by what ""outrage"" has been perpetrated by President Donald Trump.Last week, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted an enormous chunk of their airtime to parents who immigrated to the country illegally being separated from their children by federal agents — 128 minutes, almost half of their total nightly airtime not including commercials, according to the Media Research Center.By contrast, other parts of the nation's business are nearly invisible. Take, for one example, America's war in Afghanistan, which is obviously not a new topic, since it started in 2001 and is now the longest war in American history. If it doesn't feel like that, it's because it's out of sight, out of mind.Last week, U.S. Central Command said it conducted 591 airstrikes in Afghanistan in May, the most of any month this year. And more bombs were dropped in April and May than over all of 2015.But from January through June 22, the networks only mustered 32 minutes between them, barely 10 minutes each. ABC led the pack with a measly 12 minutes and 49 seconds, and CBS (11 1/2 minutes) and NBC (seven minutes and 11 seconds) were even worse.One reason should be obvious: The number of dead Americans is very low. Only two American soldiers have died in combat in Afghanistan in 2018. Those men, Sgt. 1st Class Mihail Golin and Spc. Gabriel Conde, each drew about 20 seconds of airtime on each network when they were killed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA second reason is less obvious: The networks don't have many reporters overseas anymore, and certainly not reporters covering ""forgotten wars"" with few casualties. The networks are, by nature, more likely to cover American military action when it goes wrong, as in when civilians die in the bombings.But neither reason is an excuse. This is not how war is meant to be covered — when it's your country at war.The networks haven't been any more interested in the war on terrorism in general. Trump can largely vanquish the Islamic State group as a territorial power and you can hear the crickets.Try this: On May 9, The New York Times, to its credit, reported that ""a complex cross-border sting carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence"" concluded with the capture of five senior Islamic State group officials. On CBS that night, this triumph drew 35 seconds. ABC and NBC did nothing. But all three offered full stories on the black Yale University student who was upset because someone called the police when she was found napping in a dormitory common room.So let's go back to the big picture of 2018. What did the networks obsess over instead of spending more than 32 minutes on Afghanistan? In the same time period, ABC, CBS and NBC offered 442 evening-news minutes on the still-unproven allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government in 2016. (That's in addition to the 1,234 minutes on this subject in 2017, adding up to a whopping 1,676 minutes total.)The hush-money scandal with porn star Stormy Daniels has received 107 minutes of evening-news attention. That's not counting another 81 minutes devoted to the exploits of Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen (who wrote the check to Daniels) and whether the FBI raid on his office will uncover nefarious Trump-enabling secrets.The American Army at war in Afghanistan is 30% as important as a two-bit prostitute.Whatever might cause the end of the Trump presidency is ""news."" Whatever might cause the re-election of Donald Trump is treated like it belongs in a deep, dark cave like containers of radioactive waste.Whatever is news is not news if it doesn't fit that narrative.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

6,L,"Over Memorial Day weekend, NBC's Chuck Todd opened his show ""Meet the Press"" by angrily lecturing his viewers about a so-called Trump ""tactical playbook"" on how to spin the Robert Mueller probe and the FBI informant in his presidential campaign.Here's Todd's list of Trump tactics, with our commentary:1. ""Perhaps fearing that Mueller is closing in, the president is applying a well-worn tactical playbook. Number one, distract with an invented crisis that attacks the investigators without evidence to plant a seed of doubt.""Let's pick at two phrases here. Many of Trump's supporters and more than a few independents would tell Todd that ""distract with an invented crisis ... without evidence"" is a better description of ABC, CBS and his own NBC offering about 1,500 minutes of evening-news hype about Russian ""collusion"" that still hasn't surfaced.Let that sink in: a full 25 hours of coverage about nothing much to date.In contrast, what is ""invented"" about the FBI confidential informant? You can spin about how he was really ""spying on the Russians,"" but was The New York Times making up Stefan Halper?Instead of actually reporting on Halper and his attempts to ""inform"" on Trump aides, they would rather just call it a ""distraction"" and, therefore, somehow a lie.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use2. ""Brand the crisis. According to The Associated Press, Mr. Trump wants to brand the FBI's confidential informant a spy, believing the more nefarious term would resonate more in the media and with the public. The president used some version of the word 'spy' 24 times in 15 tweets over 10 days.""Earth to NBC: Calling Trump's current standing a ""crisis,"" even as his polls are actually improving, is ... branding. Is Todd saying NBC would never dream of using ""nefarious"" terms that ""resonate ... with the public""? Here's Todd lead off in his May 22 MSNBC show: ""Fatal distraction! Are the president's systemic attacks on the Justice Department undermining the rule of law as we know it?"" ""Fatal""? Who died, Chuck? It sounds like he's writing Democrat direct-mail copy for his wife's company, Maverick Mail & Strategies.The media also use branding in a positive way. For example, immigrants who live in the country illegally and arrived to America as minors are typically framed as ""Dreamers,"" and with no ""so-called"" warning necessary.3. ""If accused of wrongdoing, use the 'I'm rubber, you're glue' defense, pinning anything you're accused of on your opponents.""This is especially obnoxious coming from journalists whose first rebuttal is often ""You can't call us biased! You are biased!"" We wonder if Todd slept through the Clinton years. When the then-President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign took donations from Chinese communists and Indonesian businessmen, ""everybody does it"" became the dominant media spin.4. ""If still caught with irrefutable facts closing in, assert that all facts are relative anyway.""President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is worried about Trump walking into a perjury trap. He told the Washington Post ""truth is relative"" and the Mueller team ""may have a different version of the truth."" At least those are the quotes the Post used.When the irrefutable facts of Clinton's lying about having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky were closing in, it was NBC's Matt Lauer who enabled Hillary Clinton to distract the country with warnings of ""a vast right-wing conspiracy."" Lauer even suggested this Lewinsky scandal could be ""the worst and most damaging smear of the 20th century.""The liberal media have no right to lecture about ""distractions"" and ""branding"" and treating facts as relative. These are all well-worn moves in their own ""tactical playbook.""Other columns by L. Brent Bozell and Tim Graham.

7,L,"The television networks have flooded us with hours and hours of coverage of the Robert Mueller probe as they continue to look under every rock for some sign of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. But on May 4, a federal judge harshly blasted Mueller's tactics in court, even going as far as challenging the scope of his authority in this probe.Was this a big story for our objective press? Did they insist on giving us a dispassionate examination of the facts? No. NBC and CBS gave it 30 seconds of airtime combined. ABC devoted two minutes to it, and that was that.A new Media Research Center study shows that in the first four months of 2018, these three networks have aired 321 minutes of evening-news coverage of the Russia investigation, and the tone toward President Trump was 98% negative. When you're this close to being perfectly negative, why wreck the trend?At least the Washington Post put the judge's bombshell rebuke on the front page Saturday. The New York Times buried it on the bottom of page A13, below other Trump-scandal stories.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves, ""PBS NewsHour"" offered nothing. NPR asked a reporter one question at the end of a segment on Saturday morning's ""Weekend Edition."" This is a story that broke on Friday, but it didn't make either network's regular ""week in review"" panel.This was a test for the Mueller-obsessed media — and they flunked. They are thoroughly invested in how Mueller's team could help them damage, or even end, the Trump presidency. They have zero interest in undermining their white knight. Apparently, they're not alone.""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,"" federal judge T.S. Ellis III scolded Mueller's team during a court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia. ""You really care about getting information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment or whatever.""He added: ""I don't see what relation this indictment has with anything the special counsel is authorized to investigate. ... What we don't want in this country is we don't want anyone with unfettered power.""It can't get much tougher than that.Mueller would appear to have unfettered power over the networks, too. While they have used the Russia investigation to bury Trump in negative evaluations, they haven't shown any interest in transparency for Mueller and his supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judge Ellis and House Republicans have demanded that Mueller fully disclose the (heavily redacted) contents of the instructions Rosenstein gave him on the scope of his investigation.On Jan. 3, when Manafort's lawyers challenged Mueller's investigation as being too broad, ABC gave it 51 seconds; NBC gave it 30 seconds; and CBS gave it 13 seconds. Add that up and so far this year, by our count, the networks have devoted roughly four minutes to serious allegations of Mueller's overreach with a team of investigators that clearly believes it has the power to delve into anyone's private life if it will harm the president.That's sure not how these transparently liberal networks treated Kenneth Starr when he threatened Bill Clinton's presidency. Back then, The Center for Media and Public Affairs found that from July through September 1998, Starr's network evening news evaluations were 15% positive and 85% negative. In the same time frame, Clinton received 37% positive coverage — while he was being impeached!Liberals pretend that criticizing or questioning Mueller reeks of obstruction of justice, but the public isn't buying this nonsense. The Media Research Center has documented that from January to April, there was another long stretch of 90% negative Trump coverage on the evening news.

It tells you everything you need to know about their political agenda.On the morning of Sunday, April 15, ABC anchor Paula Faris reported a new ABC News-Washington Post poll that showed President Trump's approval rating ""ticking up slightly"" to 40%, ""lifted in part by the strong economy."" The on-screen graphic also pointed out that 56% disapprove.Having established that America disapproves of her GOP president, it seemed fair to continue the narrative by connecting it to the next segment, with anchor Dan Harris and chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. Harris asked Stephanopoulos about his hourlong special that night that touted former FBI Director James Comey's book:""To your eyes, do you, do you see anything in this Comey book and interview that could hurt that approval rating?"" Stephanopoulos said it was ""a scathing personal assessment of President Trump, a scathing assessment of his presidency and what he believes President Trump is doing to the institutions and the rule of law in the country.""But the Washington Post poll also had bad news for Democrats in Congress.That part of the survey was covered ... on page A-4. ""Democrats hold an advantage ahead of the midterm elections, but a Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that edge has narrowed since January, a signal to party leaders and strategists that they could be premature in anticipating a huge wave of victories in November,"" the Post reported. Forty-seven percent of registered voters said they prefer the Democratic candidate in their district, and 43% favor the Republican. ""That four-point margin compares with a 12-point advantage Democrats held in January,"" the Post said.That ""blue wave"" could still happen. This is just one snapshot. But it's interesting that a shrinking advantage for Democrats didn't get a lick of airtime on ABC.

11,L,"Back in '92, the late Paul Weyrich and I held a press conference during the Republican National Convention to make two announcements.First, we were endorsing George Bush 41's re-election. Second, we'd just made the most meaningless endorsement in history. He had so thoroughly bungled his first term that there was nothing to be done to save him. And we were right.The Republicans are now facing the same future in November. At this point, they will certainly lose the House and quite possibly the Senate. Worse, they've so botched their opportunity that only they can save themselves now. Their $1.3 trillion omnibus bill was not just the most reckless spending bill in history, it was an abject surrender on every single political and policy pledge made to those who put them in office, save helping the military.It's been this way from the start. First, they asked for control of the House and its appropriations authority to right the fiscal ship, and as importantly, to end ObamaCare. In 2010, they got it — and immediately stated they could do nothing without the Senate. In 2014, they were awarded that, too — and just as quickly declared they could do nothing without the White House. So, in 2016 they were handed that, and with it complete control of the legislative process, but now with no more excuses available.And what have they done? They surrendered without a fight. Any real advance, be it Justice Gorsuch, regulatory relief, minimal border security, minimal tax cuts or minimal changes in ObamaCare, has all been driven by the White House. Congress has done nothing.Here's the difference between the two parties. For the past eight years, the GOP has been the party that begins each conversation with, ""This is why we can't do it."" The Democrats begin theirs with, ""This is how we'll get it done."" The crisis for Republicans is so grave that not even a rhetorical shift will save them. Only action, concrete action, might.

This means publicly embracing him as their leader. More to the point, it means supporting everything he puts on the table from here through November, and doing it with brio.2. Reverse that disastrous $1.3 trillion omnibus. This talk about a revision, or worse, a balanced budget amendment, is the height of hypocrisy and the public's not going to stand for it. It's like committing rape and then joining the #MeToo movement. Only tangible results, legislation that reduces the deficit and puts the government on the road to fiscal sanity, will work.3. Kill ObamaCare. Nothing less will do. The public that voted these Republicans in has had it with excuses and half-measures.4. End the funding of Planned Parenthood. The pro-life movement is leaving the GOP, and for good reason. When Republicans award the operation that proudly massacres more than 300,000 babies annually with $450,000,000 dollars taken from American taxpayers, there's no difference between the parties.5. Fund border security. The base will not stomach any more of the GOP's public displays of affection for Chuck Schumer while denying funds for Trump's border wall. Promises made, promises broken.6. Deliver real personal tax cuts. What they came up with last year rewarded big business nicely while excusing nearly 50% of Americans from the responsibility of paying taxes altogether. Everyone else was given a small amount of relief. Those were your voters, GOP.Here is the bottom line. On Sept. 30, five weeks before the election, there will be the need for a new spending bill to keep the government running. Everything listed above can be accomplished in that one piece of legislation. No more excuses. No more punts. No more stalling.It's so obvious, really. At this point the GOP faithful are set to make a devastating declaration in seven months: ""We gave you complete control, and you not only accomplished nothing, you broke your word on virtually everything. Good-bye.""And you know what, Republicans? They're right.

12,L,"The intense fear and loathing that permeates news coverage of President Trump is being multiplied on television dramas. Impeachment scenarios and 25th Amendment removal strategies are rolling around in the brains of scriptwriters.Barbara Hall, the creator of the pro-Hillary Clinton CBS show ""Madam Secretary,"" claimed ""We just take things that are already in the atmosphere, and if we find them interesting in terms of a civics lesson, we show you what it would look like. We're not campaigning for it. We're not politicizing it, really. We're just saying, 'Here's what the process looks like.'""Agenda? What agenda? It's a civics lesson.So CBS debuted a show called ""Madam Secretary"" with a heroic white female secretary of state in 2014, and it wasn't intended to promote the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton. It was merely showing ""what the process looks like"" when there's a noble, intelligent female president in waiting.In January, ""Madam Secretary"" had an episode where the president sounds too recklessly warmongering about going after Russia with ""force and ferocity"" (""fire and fury,"" anyone?), so our Madam Secretary and the White House chief of staff plot to remove him via the 25th Amendment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCan anyone imagine this plot twist if President Clinton were in office? We'd suggest there would be other topics for hot scripts, maybe a plot or two about the sexist ""deep state"" and crypto-fascist Congress that can't abide a brilliant female chief executive.CBS is also pushing an even less fictional scenario in its streaming program ""The Good Fight,"" a sequel to another Hillary-inspired drama, ""The Good Wife."" This show has real-life liberal horror Donald Trump at its center. The liberal lawyer main character, Diane Lockhart, has her firm competing with others in getting a piece of the Democratic Party's impeachment business after the midterm elections.""It's become this wet dream. We wanted to satirize that while (being realistic) about how Democrats, in our imaginations, are preparing to prosecute it,"" said the show's creator, Robert King. ""With something very controversial in the news, it's always fun to drive toward it, not run away from it."" Later this season, King and his wife and co-creator, Michelle, are promising an episode that exploits the tabloidish DNC-funded Trump-Russia dossier by former British spy Christopher Steele.The Kings do put some wretched liberal excess in their plot. A character played by Audra McDonald makes it plain she doesn't care whether the allegations that remove Trump are true or false, as long as they work.CBS is also employing a 25th Amendment plot over on the CBS-owned cable channel Showtime, in ""Homeland."" Here their paranoid female president Elizabeth Keane is fighting with her vice president, who begs her not to create a crisis by firing cabinet members who would vote to remove her.On ABC, the show ""Designated Survivor"" has its noble HUD Secretary-turned-president Tom Kirkman facing a 25th Amendment process after his wife was killed in a car accident and he turned to a therapist, whose tapes discussing the president's mental state have been leaked to the press. Kirkman is no Trump. He's more of a Mr. Smith-goes-to-Washington character. But impeachment is impeachment.In The Washington Post, TV writer Scott Tobias unloaded an unintentionally funny line that these writers are ""working at a time when television has embraced open partisanship, rejecting the firm political neutrality of the past."" Because in the Bush years, ABC's female-president drama ""Commander-in-Chief"" or NBC's heroic Democrat in ""The West Wing"" were firmly neutral?Is Hollywood just indulging itself with a liberal fantasy? Or is it preparing the public to accept impeachment and/or removal of the president as a desirable reality? If our times are so extremely partisan and desperate, why should we imagine this is all just a fictional exercise?Word to the wise: Hollywood is having a bigger impact than most realize.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Other columns by L.

16,L,"Liberal journalists have spilled a whole lot of ink in the Trump era, boasting how they've suffered watching a week or so of Fox News programming to explore the strange informational terrain of the Trump voter. They pompously proclaim it's television for your crazy Uncle Frank, pushing conspiracy theories for dumb people while nurturing resentment toward the elites — meaning, of course, them.That nasty cartoon is rebutted by the new Fox News program ""Life Liberty & Levin,"" hosted by Mark Levin. It is more intellectual than anything produced on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN or MSNBC. Nothing they have on air comes even close.For an hour, at 10 p.m. Eastern on Sunday nights, Levin interviews one guest — remember that? — drilling deep to explore how the guest has worked to protect and preserve the principles of freedom. It's substance over sizzle. It serves to enlighten, not to entertain. It is serious programming, so the liberal critics have demeaned it as a ""glacial slog.""It takes a nanosecond for Levin to go further than today's typically superficial television interview. He begins by reviewing his guest's biography, and viewers may learn a tidbit that immediately puts the guest's career in its proper perspective.Sen. Mike Lee, for example, is the son of former Solicitor General Rex Lee, and he gained his interest in politics by watching his father work in court.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Levin told viewers that they graduated from the same high school in the Philadelphia area (at a different time), and that Netanyahu spent a year after college working at the same consulting firm as former Gov. Mitt Romney. With just those two introductory nuggets, Levin has transcended the claptrap one hears from the elites at CNN or MSNBC.The series began with an interview of economics professor and columnist Walter Williams, a true icon in his field who we believe, like Thomas Sowell, has been insulted throughout his career (he's too much of a gentleman to say so himself) by so often being typecast by the media as an expert ""black economist,"" as if that were a notable or limiting descriptor (take your pick). You doubt us? Google that term and you'll find his name. Google ""economists"" and you'll find a list of the top 54 economists, and he's not on it.Levin put him front and center, where he belongs. Here's a question and an answer you'll never find on the other networks: Levin asked, ""Do you think liberty has the seeds of its own demise?"" Williams responded by explaining how tyrants always welcome freedom of speech to get their foot in the door only to undermine others' freedom of speech.The episode might remind older viewers of Milton Friedman interviews back in the '80s on his PBS series ""Free to Choose."" It will remind you of absolutely nothing on television today.How about Levin digging into matters like the meaning of the words in the Declaration of Independence, of natural law and inalienable rights, with Hillsdale College President Dr. Larry Arnn?They discussed how progressives undermine America's founding principles, and Dr. Arnn expertly put matters in proper perspective: ""(T) he first thing that happens is ... they start writing about this Declaration of Independence — 'It was really good for the time but not relevant anymore.' ... and that won't work, by the way, because if the Declaration is false now, it was false then by its own terms, right?""Liberals also peg Fox News as toeing the Trump line 24/7. That's certainly not true of Levin. In the last few weeks, he and several of his guests have brutally pounded on the Republican leadership for passing a 2,200-plus-page monstrosity of an omnibus spending bill, and passing it with absolutely no time for members of Congress to actually read it first (never mind debate it).One of those guests is former Attorney General Ed Meese, Levin's old boss in the years of President Reagan. On the other hand, Meese also deemed President Trump's judicial appointments ""outstanding,"" praising Trump for selecting judges that adhere to the Constitution, and consulting The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation. It's the kind of discussion those dumb conservatives want to hear and those elites don't want dumb conservatives to hear.Millions of Americans have enjoyed Levin's books on liberty and tyranny, and now it's possible to get some of that wisdom every Sunday on cable TV. All credit should go to Fox News for daring to put a calm hour of serious talk about political philosophy on the air.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Facebook Still Hasn't Owned Up To One Huge Privacy BreachThe Gender Pay Gap Is Nothing Compared With These Other Workplace GapsBy Handing Out Driver's Licenses, Far-Left California Invites Illegals To Stay — And Taxpayers To Pay

21,L,"This week's big planned Trump administration announcement of emergency investment and export rules targeting China is out, and it doesn't include any rules or even mention China. By now it should be clear that Trump is bending over backwards to soothe Beijing and avoid a China trade war.Instead of detailing tough new emergency measures, including a reported 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology, Trump will instead back legislation moving through Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.In a statement that never mentions China, Trump noted, ""certain countries direct and facilitate systematic investment in United States companies and assets in order to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property in industries those countries deem important.""Last week, Trump called members of Congress to the White House to stop them from interfering with his plan to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs at communications equipment firm ZTE put at risk by U.S. sanctions.Trump's moves appear designed to facilitate progress in trade negotiations ahead of a July 6 Trump tariff deadline that may dramatically intensify the emerging China trade war. On that date, the U.S. is to impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports, with tariffs on another $16 billion in goods due shortly thereafter. China has said it will match Trump tariffs dollar for dollar, whenever they are imposed.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all rallied early Wednesday on hopes that Trump's move to delay investment and export restrictions might keep the China trade war on the back burner. But they reversed sharply lower as the bond yield curve narrowed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Trump had been ""spooked"" by Monday's market sell-off, which helped spur the change in plans.Trump has already made clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would  ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy.Trump's latest decision could be a reprieve for the semiconductor sector. Chip equipment from key U.S. suppliers Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) was seen as one likely area for controlling exports. Chinese companies account for about 6% of the group's sales.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.On Tuesday, the House cleared the modernized CFIUS bill, which now will move to a conference merging it with a Senate-passed bill.Trump's statement said that ""such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE: Dow Jones Futures: 5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedStocks Strengthen In Afternoon; Netflix, Apple, Intuitive Surgical Lead Nasdaq 100Faster Than Concorde: Boeing Hypersonic Jet Concept Would Cross Atlantic In 2 HoursTesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

26,L,"One measure of how old we're getting is realizing how many voters today have no familiarity with the Chappaquiddick scandal. In July of 1969, then-Sen. Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge into a pond with a young woman in the passenger seat and left the scene of the accident alone. Kennedy waited 10 hours to report it, and Mary Jo Kopechne died.This is one compelling reason why many older voters thought liberals sounded preposterous when they suggested Donald Trump's presidential campaign should be canceled over the ""Access Hollywood"" tape of him boasting of grabbing women in the crotch. Kennedy had a woman's death on his resume, and it never stopped the left from boosting him as the finest presidential timber.How far has the manipulative Kennedy dynasty fallen? Somehow, the movie ""Chappaquiddick"" was made with well-known actors and distributed to movie theaters. Seven years ago, pressure caused the History Channel to deep-six a dramatic Kennedy miniseries (it ended up on the obscure cable channel Reelz).This movie is drawing favorable reviews from the movie critics. That's in part because they recognize the filmmakers didn't make a hard-edged cartoon — like, for example, the way Oliver Stone smeared then-President George W. Bush in 2008. From the first moments, the Ted Kennedy in this film is haunted by his older brothers, who were inflated into political giants, and spurned as a loser by his nearly mute father, who suffered a stroke in 1961.Staying close to the historical record is brutal enough. Kennedy left the scene of a fatal accident, failed to report it for hours, lied to investigators and the public about how and when it happened, and then expected that everyone would accept what he had done and re-elect him. The film notes at the end he was re-elected overwhelmingly and became known (to some) as the ""Lion of the Senate.""It also shows how the Kennedy political machine arrived to manipulate the press, and even the Kopechne family. There was no autopsy. This was pitched as another Kennedy tragedy, and the national media eagerly xeroxed the narrative.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOne of the things that the moviemakers get wrong is the idea that the press were hostile. The only named reporter in the movie was James Reston of The New York Times, who the script suggests was skeptical of Kennedy's claim of having suffered a concussion. In real life, Reston was, in the words of media critic Jack Shafer, one of those who ""attended to the family's legend like priests on retainer.""Reston's first draft on Chappaquiddick began, ""Tragedy has again struck the Kennedy family."" Mention of the actual victim was submerged in paragraph four. Luckily, the Times advised Reston to edit it and mention the actual victim in the lede. After Kennedy spoke to the nation with his dishonest narrative about what happened, Reston oozed again that he was a ""tragic 'profile in courage.'""For the rest of Sen. Kennedy's life, the media treated Chappaquiddick as an extremely distasteful subject only conspiracy-obsessed right-wingers thought was important. Whenever the scandal surfaced, journalists turned it into a story of ""redemption.""That's still happening. Former Boston Globe reporter Peter Canellos, now executive editor of Politico Magazine, did a write-up on the movie and oozed that it ""marked the start of one of the most remarkable revivals in American politics, as Kennedy settled down to the hard work of legislating and, almost as penance, went on to amass the most impressive list of accomplishments in Senate history.""As long as a politician can pass ""landmark"" liberal bills, his personal scandals are washed away by liberal journalists. And they call themselves idealists.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

27,L,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

28,L,"Chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) received a stock rating downgrade Friday over concerns about slower foundry investments in the second half of 2018.Needham analyst Edwin Mok lowered his rating on KLA-Tencor to hold from buy. He made the move after recent checks suggested an increased risk for slower 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer semiconductor equipment investments later this year.""While we like KLAC's longer-term prospects, we expect the foundry delays coupled with some memory push-outs to drive downside to consensus view in second-half calendar 2018 and limit near-term share price appreciation,"" Mok said in a report.KLA-Tencor is facing a situation similar to what happened in 2015 when foundries delayed investments in 16-nanometer and 10-nanometer technology.

It slashed through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, both key support levels.The Milpitas, Calif.-based company would be impacted by spending cuts at customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Taiwan Semi is likely to reduce or even delay its 5-nanometer pilot factory line investment, based on channel checks. Also, Taiwan Semi is likely to slow the growth of its 7-nanometer capacity, Mok said.""Coupled with limited investments by the other leading foundries, we expect to see a smaller-than-expected foundry rebound in second-half 2018,"" Mok said. That would drive down sales and earnings for KLA-Tencor.RELATED:Data Storage Firm Smart Global Holdings Beats Earnings TargetIntel CEO Resigns After Probe Of Improper Relationship With StafferMicron Earnings Report Shows Strength Of Memory Chip Market

33,L,"The leftist-organized wave of school walkouts on March 14 to protest gun violence is a classic example of the way protests are categorized by our news and entertainment media.1. Liberal protests are authentic cries from the grass roots; conservative protests are ""AstroTurf."" How homegrown were these liberal walkouts? They were organized weeks ago by the Women's March on Washington leftists. Liberal parents forced school administrators to knuckle under and allow the walkouts without punishment. They were supported by passionate media coverage and media conglomerates like Viacom, which dedicated 17 minutes of airtime to show solidarity.So, was this organized political activism? Helaine Olen at The Washington Post noted a bunch of this activity and then claimed that the idea that students were being ""manipulated by greater adult left-wing forces"" is ""conspiracy theorizing"" and ""absurd.""1a. This week's corollary: Liberal protests by children, organized and promoted by adults, are to be celebrated as child-generated. But conservative children going to a protest are uneducated robots influenced by their ministers or parents.Who are these kids anyway? The Washington Post celebrated the walkouts with the front-page headline ""We're the Next Generation."" Liberals represent everybody. We are the world and all that.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut when tens of thousands of teenagers attend the March for Life across the country, the national media ignore them — unless it's to expose the nefarious nature of those Christian zealots. In 2017, the media site Vocativ found Catholic young adults who felt they had been used. ""I was in 5th grade when I started going to the march,"" Miranda O'Shea complained. ""At that time we barely even knew what an abortion was, let alone the real meanings behind it."" Another woman said: ""I really feel for the kids under 18 that get bussed in. I don't really think they should go to the event until they've reached a point where they can decide if they want to go.""2. Liberal protests are newsworthy because they're disruptive; conservative protests are too orderly to be worth discussing. The news angle with the gun protests was the disobedience involved in walking out, something to be celebrated. Leftist protests demand police activity because leftists break stuff, and they demand to be arrested because it somehow makes them heroic. One hundred thousand conservatives could show up on the National Mall in our nation's capital and not leave behind so much as a candy wrapper on the ground. Bo-ring.3. Finally, liberal protests are somehow not political. When co-host Meghan McCain stated the facts on these marches on ""The View"" — a show that advocates passing gun control legislation and sticking it to the National Rifle Association — Whoopi Goldberg was outraged. She said: ""Let's stick to what this particular march is today. ... It's not political."" What will Whoopi claim next? That ""The View"" isn't political either?The Women's March organizers of this walkout wanted to protest not just gun violence but also racism, police brutality and how ""the United States has exported gun violence through imperialist foreign policy to destabilize other nations."" That's superpolitical.This whole process — liberal reporting followed by liberal protests — is one organized political campaign. The media start the outrage machine, demanding a liberal course of action, and the protests are organized to keep the story fresh by taking the demand for action to the streets.Any political analysis of this modus operandi leads liberals to make bizarre arguments, as if the protesters represent the entire public and their agenda is so universally supported it's no longer political. This gaseous bubble must be popped by conservatives for what it is: ""fake news,"" not facts.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

While former top stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) break down amid signs of slowing shipments, other semiconductor stocks are nearing potential entries and even attempting to break out in the stock market today.XChip gear maker Entegris (ENTG) tried to break out above a base's 38.35 buy point Thursday after announcing it acquired the SAES Pure Gas business from SAES Getters.

37,L,"A Wall Street analyst on Wednesday downgraded top semiconductor-equipment stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), but upgraded a third, ASML Holding (ASML).RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves sees demand softening for wafer fabrication equipment and organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display gear, negatively impacting Applied Materials and Lam. But ASML will benefit from deployments of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment for etching chips, he said.Steves lowered his rating on Applied Materials to sector perform from outperform and cut his 12-month price target to 55 from 64. He downgraded Lam to sector perform from outperform as well and slashed his price target to 210 from 245.Applied Materials stock gained 0.2% to close at 50.98 on the stock market today.

However, one significant area of growth in the industry will be in EUV systems from ASML, he said.""For investors that need exposure to the group, we would recommend buying ASML,"" he said in a report.

38,L,"Homebuilder stocks could be set to take another battering after an analyst warned of a slowdown in housing sales.XSpring selling season has got off to a weak start, a bad sign as it is a key period for the housing industry for both new- and existing-home sales.CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon believes the fact that home orders are not breaking new highs amid a strong economy could lead to lower revenue growth for homebuilders in the second half of 2018 and 2019.""While the spring selling season lasts through June, the data points we see so far are not encouraging,"" Leon said in a research note. ""In fact, the most recent releases confirm our key take-away that homebuilders are seeing higher pricing gains, but lower order unit growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe singled out KB Home (KBH), Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) and Toll Bros. (TOL) as stocks that could struggle amid market challenges. The sector's recent struggles also saw LGI Home (LGIH) drop out of the prestigious IBD 50 stock list.However, D.R. Horton (DHI), due to its more diversified offerings and geographical markets, could flourish.Homebuilder stocks were the top market group in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But they've been stock-market laggards in 2018 as mortgage rates have climbed along with Treasury yields, which are getting a boost from expectations for faster inflation.The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 184th place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.According to Leon, order growth will have to rebound from mid-single digits to high-single-digit-to-low teen range in both units and order value to suggest the market is as robust as 2017. However, he is skeptical due to the late stage of the economic cycle.Government data suggest new-home sales are slowing down. In addition, confidence among homebuilders is falling, despite higher pricing gains helping to at least partially offset lower order unit growth.Mortgage rates are another headwind. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit 4.6%, an eight-year high.There is still a chance the booming jobs market could help buck the trend. Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has added 2.7 million jobs, and since his tax cuts took effect there has been an average 200,000 new jobs each month. There has yet to be an accompanying jump in wages though.""Risks to our more cautious views on the housing market and new home starts would be strong job and wage income growth with mortgage rates flat to down, near 4.5%, in the next twelve months,"" Leon said. ""A slower rate of price increases would also be relief to affordability, especially in more expensive coastal markets like Seattle and (California).""And while homebuilders are skeptical, last month consumer confidence in housing was at an all-time high, according to Fannie Mae.The government-sponsored mortgage provider's Home Purchase Sentiment Index showed the confidence of those who think home prices will move even higher rose the most, while those who think it is a good time to sell came in second.The only group that reported a drop in confidence was those who think it's a good time to buy.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Analysts Bullish On Homebuilder Stocks Despite Dip — Here's WhyLGI Homes Crushed Earnings Views With Stock Already In Buy ZoneStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

39,L,"President Trump upset the media greatly at a rally in Pennsylvania, where he enthusiastically mocked NBC's Chuck Todd as a ""sleeping son of a b----."" Retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw tweeted: ""Really classy.""Explain that to your children.""On ""Meet the Press"" the next day, Todd tried to shame Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about Trump's contempt for a free press by asking him, ""When (President Trump) uses vulgarity to talk about individuals, what are they supposed to tell their kids?""Todd told the local NBC station, News4: ""I bring my kids up to respect the office of the presidency and the president. I don't allow them to say anything negative, ever, about the president. ... it creates a challenge to all parents when he uses vulgarities like that.""That would make Todd the most hypocritical father in Washington. He says everything negative about the president. He warned that Trump had a ""lame-duck presidency"" on the ""brink of collapse"" ... two months in to the presidency. He called Trump's attacks on the press ""un-American"" and asked, ""Could (Russian President) Putin have asked for anything more?"" Then, ""Free Press Chuck"" denounced the conservative media as Trump's ""Kool-Aid orbit."" He even compared Trump's election to the 9/11 terrorist attack.President Trump should not have used that language. No president should. But save us the lectures, please. Anyone watching television knows that curse words — like ""SOB"" — are commonplace in front of children, whether it's broadcast, cable or streaming, late night or early evening. Today's ""Son of a b----!"" is yesterday's ""Damn!"" and last week's ""Darn!""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLiberal media elites feigning shock at the utterance of curse words in front of The Children is ridiculous. The hypocrisy here is immense — and shameless.It would be nice if NBC and all the other TV networks would air less vulgarity. Then it would be reasonable to grab the smelling salts and call out Trump for his inappropriate language.Oh, and speaking of hypocrisy, where are the Tom Brokaws and Chuck Todds of the world when Democrats curse? Take Hillary Clinton, who appeared on BBC's ""The Graham Norton Show"" to plug her why-she-lost book last year. When talking about Trump's inaugural speech, she said, ""And it was reported that George W. Bush, as it ends, says, 'That was some weird s---.'"" Laughter and applause erupted, and host Graham Norton replied, ""And it was."" No one fell on a fainting couch.The Chuck Todds don't even blink when Democrats curse at ... Chuck Todd! They all laughed when then-President Obama made a video for the 2016 White House correspondents dinner in which Todd reported that Obama would become ""couch commander"" after leaving office. ""F--- you, Chuck Todd,"" Obama responded in the video.Did Todd explain that skit to his kids? You think he doesn't keep a copy of that video for future generations of the Todd family? Vulgarities don't matter when the press is laughing alongside their heroes. It's not the words that matter. It's the contempt.One reason Trump's ridicule resonates with voters is the media's arrogant lie about being nonpartisan voices of Truth. Two days before Trump cursed about Todd, Todd gave a speech at a media awards dinner and unloaded a whopper.He said: ""One thing we're not is the opposition. We've never tried to be part of the political debate, but people want to drag us into it. We shouldn't take the bait. We're simply a voice of truth.""The media have ""never tried to be part of the political debate""? A ""voice of truth""? That's a Levi's factory of pants on fire. Explain that to Todd's kids, since their mother operates a direct-mail firm for Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders — who paid her firm almost $2 million in the 2016 race.In his speech, Todd even proclaimed, ""Transparency is the new objectivity."" But he never tells viewers about his wife's business when he interviews Sanders on ""Meet the Press"" (he has 17 times since the start of 2016). Todd apparently thinks the rest of us are sleeping SOBs.

41,L,"Dow Jones giants Apple (AAPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) reportedly are teaming up to issue a credit card.The card will have Apple Pay branding and could launch early next year, sources told the Wall Street Journal it will carry. It's another way for the iPhone giant to extract cash from customers and boost its Apple Pay profile. For Goldman Sachs, which is moving into retail banking, this would be the first time that it's issues a credit card.Apple and Goldman are working out the terms and benefits of the planned card. In addition, the partnership will see Goldman offer in-Apple Store loans to customers buying iPhones and other products.An Apple-Goldman card would push aside Barclays (BCS) as Apple's rewards-card partner. Apple and U.K.-based Barclays currently offer a credit card with interest-free financing on Apple devices and points toward Apple Store and iTunes gift cards.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock is just extended from a 179.04 buy point in a double-bottom base, MarketSmith analysis shows. Goldman rose 0.7%, but hit resistance at its 200-day line. Barclays inched up 0.7%.Apple is trying to ramp up services revenue as iPhone sales growth slows down. The Apple Pay platform generates revenue on each transaction, however adoption has been slower than executives hoped. Improving use is a key part of its strategy.Goldman is seeking to move into consumer banking to offset a slump in its core securities-trading business. Revenue has fallen by more than 60% since the financial crisis, though its once-quiet bond and stock trading desks roared back to life in the first quarter.Back in 2016 it launched retail banking business Marcus for online savings accounts and personal loans. Last month the company said it had bought the personal finance app Clarity Money, which will strengthen its Marcus online lending service. Management is also looking into adding credit cards and wealth-management tools.""This move clearly shows that Goldman Sachs sees big opportunity in credit cards,"" said Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst. ""Despite worries in the industry about the rising cost of rewards and the uptick in delinquencies, banks still make a ton of profit off of credit cards and Goldman Sachs wants to get its share.""Schulz added: ""This isn't just about short-term profits for Goldman Sachs. It's also about branding. It's about tying their brand with Apple's hugely powerful brand and potentially establishing long-term relationships with Apple's highly desirable customer base, who tend to be younger than your typical Goldman client, more affluent than the average American and famously loyal to Apple.""Amazon (AMZN) reportedly has talked with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Capital One Financial (COF) to create a checking-account-like product intended to attract teenagers that don't have credit or debit cards.Amazon's business-lending service also has reportedly partnered with Bank of America (BAC) to offer small-business loans.An account for cardless teenagers would allow Amazon to draw in that population early.

In the Fed's May 2 news release, the central bank noted that the U.S. economy was rising at ""a moderate rate.""At the session high of 7748, the index has now marched 12.2% higher since Jan. 1. On IBD Leaderboard, the year-to-date gains have been steeper.Lululemon (LULU), which initially joined the Leaders list on Leaderboard on Feb. 7, has jumped 61% since Jan. 1. Shares in the premium-priced yogawear and sports apparel firm have also ramped up more than 50% since it roared off the 10-week moving average in late March, triggering a buy signal. On Wednesday, the stock backtracked into slightly negative territory after rising 1.9% to as high as 127.34.Fast-growing Etsy (ETSY) and Five Below (FIVE), two more consumer spending-oriented names on Leaderboard, have also scored market-smashing gains.The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as declines in wood products, homebuilding, mortgage service, paper, auto parts, department store and oil and gas machinery stocks offset strength in wholesale drug supply, movie, gaming software, drugstore chain and computer networking firms.The Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones utility average fell fractionally, but at 665 the sector index has dropped more than 8% so far this year. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 3 basis points to 2.99%, still below its May 17 peak of 3.11%.Volume is running sharply higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Going back to Netflix, shares bolted more than 4% higher and got as high as 384.25. Volume is running at a 127% faster than usual pace after Goldman Sachs reportedly boosted its long-term price target to $490 from $390. Analyst Heath Terry forecast that in 2019 the video streaming firm would garner 32.5 million net new subscribers. That well exceeds Wall Street's consensus estimate of 26 million net new adds.The very best companies in terms of fundamentals and stock price strength are able to launch breakouts from third, fourth, and even fifth stage bases. But later-stage bases always carry a higher risk of failure and a significant price correction.Netflix hauled out of a first-stage base at 107.07 in October 2016, then broke out again in the week ended July 21, 2017. Shares cleared a 166.97 buy point in a six-week cuplike base, then ramped up more than 20% before forming a third-stage base.More recently, Netflix surpassed a 338.92 follow-on entry point after testing support at the 10-week moving average in both March and April.In the year 2009, Netflix scored $1.67 billion in annual revenue. Last year, the top line grew 32% vs. the prior year to $11.69 billion. So over the past eight years, Netflix's revenue has not only risen 600%, but it's also achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 27%.Earnings have climbed from 28 cents a share to $1.25 over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the Los Gatos, Calif., company growing earnings 129% this year to $2.86 a share on a 38% jump in revenue to $16.1 billion.The Street also sees Netflix's top line shattering the $20 billion barrier in 2019.Other FAANG stocks continue to act well.Alphabet (GOOGL) edged up 0.2% for a third up day in a row. The Google search engine owner has formed a seven-day handle on its new double bottom.In Alphabet's double bottom base, the second sell-off took shares down to 984, undercutting the early February sell-off low of 997.An undercut of the first low is good action within this type of base, and the middle peak in between the two sell-offs plus 10 cents offers a standard buy point.So in Alphabet's case, the buy point of 1,178.26 offers a proper entry for growth investors. But the new downward slanting handle, formed in light volume, offers a lower buy point at 1,161.20.Microsoft (MSFT), part of the so-called ""FAAMG"" megacap tech clan, continues to inch higher and is near new highs. At 101.33, the cloud computing, business software and computer and video game console giant remains within the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 97.34 in a six-week flat base.In the March-ended fiscal third quarter, Microsoft posted a 16% boost in earnings to 95 cents a share. That's on top of a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenue accelerated 16% to $26.82 billion. That marked the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 14 quarters.In other stocks today, TAL Education (TAL), ranking No. 9 in the IBD 50, fell sharply on reports that short selling firm Muddy Waters said it's sold shares short. The Carson Block-led firm reportedly accused the for-profit school operator of overstating its earnings from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, ended in February that year.The stock slumped as much 16% to a session low of 38.41 before recouping some of those losses. The stock undercut the 50-day moving average but quickly gained institutional buying support.On May 10, TAL broke out of a six-week cup without handle, but heavy volume was absent. Ideally, a breakout should involve a minimum 40% to 50% increase in volume vs. the 50-day average.All daily charts in Investors.com and MarketSmith show the 50-day average turnover as a red line drawn across the volume bars at the bottom of each chart.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, proper sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:How Are The Top Growth Stocks Faring?

53,L,"The Dow Jones is still rangebound, but the S&P 500 index hit a multi-month high while the Nasdaq composite set a record close Monday. So it's a good time to be looking for top stocks to buy. IBD 50 stocks Alibaba (BABA), ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and Grubhub (GRUB) are all in buy range now. Tal Education (TAL), which was in buy range, sold off Monday to end just below its entry.The IBD 50 is an elite list of the very best stocks. Alibaba, ServiceNow, Red Hat, Grubhub all boast best-possible IBD Composite Ratings of 99. Tal Education has a 98 Composite Rating. Big stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their runs.All of these stocks are recent breakouts, but they have had some trouble holding in buy areas. That reflects the sideways stock market action of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and, until last week, the Nasdaq composite.Also the breakout volume generally has been light-to-lackluster, with the partial exception of Alibaba. That suggests a lack of conviction buying by mutual funds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlibaba rose 3.2% to 204.34 in Friday's stock market trading, moving above a 201.60 double-bottom buy point. Volume was 33% above normal.

54,L,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500, closing the session at 2798, is up 4.6%.On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hits the wires at 10 a.m. ET.

X When you're researching the best stocks to buy and watch, keep a close on eye on relative price strength.IBD's proprietary rating measures market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The grade shows how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. History shows that the top-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest climbs.See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksHi-Crush Partners broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 13.35 entry from a double bottom. If a stock you're tracking breaks past a buy point then declines 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. While revenue growth fell last quarter from 222% to 162%, EPS grew 942%, up from 0% in the prior report. The company holds the No. 8 rank among its peers in the Chemicals-Specialty industry group.

88,L,"Leftists in the Trump era claim to be the guardians of the First Amendment against an allegedly authoritarian president. But over the past few years, leftists have been the authoritarians on campus, squashing speeches by speakers they deem ""fascist"" and claiming that ideas they don't agree with are somehow tantamount to ""violence.""XThe latest example came from Lewis & Clark College in Portland — the alma mater of Monica Lewinsky. On March 5, the local Federalist Society welcomed Christina Hoff Sommers, author of ""The War Against Boys"" and ""Who Stole Feminism?""A gaggle of leftist groups scribbled a letter in which they demanded the college cancel this speaker and her ""violence."" They claimed, ""under the guise of 'open debate' and 'free discourse,' the Federalist Society ... (invited) a known fascist to our campus to encourage what we believe to be an act of aggression and violence toward members of our society who experience racial and gendered oppression.""No members of the public or reporters were allowed to attend, just law school students. When Sommers arrived to speak, the leftists tried to block the entrance to the room. Once the speech began, they prevented Sommers from talking by shouting things like ""Microaggressions are real"" and ""No platform for fascists.""Sommers says Janet Steverson, a law professor and — paging George Orwell — dean of ""diversity and inclusion"" at the school, asked her to ""wrap up"" her speech and take questions, and that said she only made it halfway through her speech. Halfway is better than not at all.This ""resistance"" is happening all over. In October, Seattle University's law school revoked its co-sponsorship of an immigration debate hosted by its chapter of the Federalist Society.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersShortly after that, the Texas Southern University law school canceled a Federalist Society chapter event that was to feature conservative State Rep. Briscoe Cain. Protesters yelled: ""No hate anywhere! You don't get a platform here!"" and ""When a racist comes to town, shut him down!"" The college president shut it down, alleging the meeting was not authorized.No one in the national media covered this week's outrage with Sommers — except New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss, in a piece titled ""We Are All Fascists Now."" Inside The Times, other writers want Weiss removed. They can't have ""neocons"" on staff.Instead, papers like the Washington Post prefer covering speeches by actual neo-Nazis. On March 6, it was covering Richard Spencer's speech at Michigan State University — due to legal challenges, it was allowed to go on, although attendance was very poor, and it was scheduled during spring break to minimize disruption. Nevertheless, the Post wrote almost 1,000 words on this fiasco. It began: ""Fights broke out between white supremacists and protesters Monday as anti-fascist activists, students and community members converged in and around Michigan State University to counter a speech by white nationalist Richard Spencer."" Everywhere these racists go they draw more protesters than supporters.This sentence perfectly summed up the left: ""Josh Lown, a protest organizer and graduate student at Michigan State, said midday Monday that they were hoping to avoid violence while disrupting Spencer's appearance as much as possible."" Even so, protest organizers ""posted an image on social media playing off the university's 'Spartans will ...' campaign, showing a still from a video of a man punching Spencer.""Conservatives cannot and will not accept lectures from the left about ""democracy dying in darkness"" while it shuts down — or beats up — people it doesn't like.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:What's Oozing Out Of College Campuses Is Polluting SocietyNow We Know: It's Liberals Who Are Out-Of-Touch, Arrogant, Smug And Intolerant

90,L,"Through May 31, the S&P 500 was up 1.3% year to date. Not a savory number for index investors. The Nasdaq composite rose 7.8%. And the IBD 50 gained 5.1%.While the list of premier growth companies has outperformed the large-cap benchmark by nearly fourfold, have some of the individual names done even better? You bet.Use the IBD 50 as a timesaving screen for picking great stocks at the right time. You know that making the IBD 50 means a company has top-notch fundamentals and wonderful relative strength. But the IBD 50 remains a watch list, not a buy list.What does this mean? Let the chart analysis at the bottom of every mini chart in IBD Weekly be your compass. If a stock is breaking out and in the permissible buy range, the analysis will say so. If not, then stay alert for follow-on buy points.Such additional entry points may include first and second rebounds off the 10-week moving average. Or a stock may thrust out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.Let's consider Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), SVB Financial (SIVB), Trade Desk (TTD) and TAL Education (TAL). All five made the IBD 50 during the week of Feb. 26. February was a pivotal month in 2018 so far; the S&P 500 suffered its first 10%-plus correction since February of 2016. Yet these five companies flexed strength.They also help teach stock traders the importance of being nimble.Viper Energy finished the week ended Feb. 23 with a tiny gain, up 0.3%. That trailed a 0.5% rebound by the S&P 500. Then the U.S. oil and gas play fell for three weeks in a row.On the surface that sounds bad, right?Well, not necessarily. This is where careful analysis of Viper's weekly chart comes into play. While the stock did fall three weeks in a row, it limited the overall decline to 3.2% — skimpy and stingy losses.Check out the week ended March 16. Viper bounded off its lows of the week and cut the loss to just 0.4%. It was a tight weekly close. Tight weekly closes within a base matter. Viper had a lot of them. Treat them as a subtle clue that institutional investors are not that willing to dump shares.The Midland, Texas-based firm uncoiled out of its base with a breakout past 26.29 on April 5. Volume wasn't hissing quietly; 1.3 million shares exchanged hands, 219% above the 50-day average. Big price move, big volume on the breakout? Good results usually follow.Viper is now trading near 32, up 22% past the proper entry.Intuitive Surgical, noted as a ""stock of the day"" in IBD's social media coverage, hit a new high of 452 on Jan. 25, then began falling a few days before the major indexes did. Shares basically floated within a relatively tight trading range of 400 to 450.But on April 18, the stock's character changed. After reporting strong Q1 results (earnings up 43%, revenue up 25%, the biggest top-line jump in more than four years), Intuitive jammed out of an 11-week base. Both 452.10 and 445.20 are valid entry points.The robotic surgery systems pioneer has not gained a lot since then. But at 459, the medical stock leader has stretched its advance from an early breakout at 242.49 in February 2017 to 89%.SVB Financial, TAL and Trade Desk have also cleared new bases in recent weeks and are spanking the S&P 500 with year-to-date returns of 33%, 43% and 87%.You can trade the IBD 50 efficiently with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) by Innovator Capital.

Contract manufacturer Pegatron is building the devices, with LG Display (LPL) providing the screen, DigiTimes said.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook reportedly will begin mass production of the speakers in June, but it has cut order volumes for 2018 by about 20% from its original plan, DigiTimes said.Amazon currently leads the smart-speaker market with its lineup of Echo devices, followed by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home devices.Apple (AAPL) entered the market with its HomePod premium audio speaker in February, but sales have been lackluster, analysts say. Apple has cut production orders for the HomePod to 200,000 units a month from 500,000, DigiTimes said.Smart speakers have raised consumer privacy concerns because they are devices in your home that always listen to what you're saying. Smart speakers respond to spoken questions and commands.Facebook shares are down as a result of the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal. Zuckerberg testified about the scandal in front of two congressional committees.

94,L,"A China-based new issue snapped free of its IPO base Tuesday and Wednesday, and Boise, Idaho's largest building products manufacturer remained in a buy range after a Friday breakout.But bank stocks Wednesday occupied nearly half of an Investor's Business Daily screen showing 32 stocks hitting new highs during the session, according to preliminary calculations. All of those were regional banks, most responding to banking reform legislation passed Tuesday and awaiting only a signature from President Trump in order to become law.The bill, among many other things, rolls back compliance oversight on banks managing between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets. All of the banks in that range which were hashing out new highs Wednesday traded well below the 400,000 share-per-day minimum required for CAN SLIM-grade stocks.Another new high went briefly to Urban Outfitters (URBN). The parent of the Anthropologie and Urban Outfitter chains reported a strong first-quarter beat, including a 280% surge in earnings. But sellers took control of the stock shortly after the open, driving the stock down nearly 1%. Shares remained extended above a 36.20 buy point.China-based IPO OneSmart International (ONE) trades more than 500,000 shares per day on average. The company provides after-school educational services for kindergarten through 12th grade students, similar to the much larger TAL Education Group (TAL).TAL has been among the top China-based stocks, rising 111% over the past year. On Wednesday, the stock was in a buy range above a 43.58 flat base buy point. However, the base was very late stage. That meant the breakout bore an above-average risk of failure.OneSmart is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Shares spiked 9% Tuesday and 10% on Wednesday. That left the stock 23% above its March 28 IPO price and extended above an 11.96 buy point in a three-week IPO base.IPOs can be wild, and OneSmart is no exception. The stock dived 22% below its IPO price April 30. That set the stage for the stock's first consolidation. Investors who jumped in at the buy point will want to make sure they stick hard-and-fast to the rule that triggers an automatic sale when a stock falls 7% to 8% below its buy point.Boise Cascade (BCC) retouched its high from Tuesday during Wednesday's session. It then pulled back, remaining well within buy range above a cup-with-handle buy point at 45.20.Boise earned 85% of its 2017 revenue through distributing building materials made by other manufacturers. The remainder came from its lumber-products manufacturing business.The outfit has reported three quarters of accelerating revenue growth. Earnings growth upshifted into triple-digit gains in the first quarter.The stock has gained 70% over the last 12 months. But its base is a second-stage pattern, which suggests the stock may have some room to run before a more serious consolidation is necessary.Boise peer TopBuild (BLD) also scored a new high Wednesday.

95,L,"When Bill Clinton was president, the liberal media establishment flogged itself for focusing on scandal over substance. In a four-hour PBS special during the fall election season of 1996, elitist Hedrick Smith confessed: ""By focusing on scandal and conflict over substance, and by our increasingly negative tone, the media has distorted the nation's agenda and lost touch with the public we claim to serve.""XNo one can imagine Smith complaining like this now that Donald Trump lives in the White House. One's a Democrat, the other a Republican. One is a man they genuinely admire, the other a man they genuinely despise.In the years of President Barack Obama, they pretended there were no scandals at all. Obama is still lying about this, having recently proclaimed at a closed-door session in Boston, ""We didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" The liberal ""fact-checkers"" like PolitiFact and Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post were napping on Obama, as usual.Fast and Furious? IRS scandal? Benghazi? Nope, doesn't ring a bell.But the Trump presidency is an ongoing and frenetic demonstration of the media choosing ""scandal over substance."" It is virtually all scandal all the time, even when there isn't a lick of evidence.A new Media Research Center study of the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC during January and February found that 91% of Trump evaluations were negative. Nearly 63% of news coverage was devoted to scandals like the Russia investigation (204 minutes), the allegations of wife beating against White House aide Rob Porter (54 minutes), unproven gossip from Michael Wolff's book about the Trump White House (53 minutes) and reports that Trump used the term ""s---hole countries"" in a discussion on African countries and immigration (31 minutes).Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Because it's been that, or like that, every single month since the election.The networks obviously believe their nightly narrative should not be diluted by focusing on any matter where Trump might be succeeding. Thus far in 2018, they have barely bothered to evaluate how Trump is doing on the economy and jobs (12 minutes), or the positive impact of the tax cuts passed in December (nine minutes). Guess how much time was spent on Team Trump's war against al-Qaida and ISIS: 83 seconds.Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, the three evening newscasts have spent a combined 1,438 minutes on the Russia investigation, accounting for more than one out of every five minutes (21%) of ""news"" time on the Trump presidency.And still, there is no evidence of Trump colluding with the government of Russia to get him elected. There is proof that agents paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign met with the Russians to get dirt on Trump. But the Clintons created multiple layers of separation (or deniability), so, apparently, that wasn't scandalous in the slightest.Every study of the media's performance reveals the ""news"" product is hyperbolic, negative and seemingly designed to make the Trump presidency appear perpetually on the verge of collapse. How can any of these journalists be surprised that Trump backers don't trust their narration of the first draft of history as it unfolds?

The stock faded from its highest levels on Tuesday, which is not unusual given Carbonite's history with breakouts. The past five breakouts since 2017 have resulted in minor gains, with shares soon falling into new consolidations.Carbonite late Monday reported adjusted earnings of 27 cents a share, triple the year-ago profit. Sales climbed 12% to $64 million. The cloud storage company beat expectations. Carbonite has the highest IBD Composite Rating in the industry group, along with Smart Global Holdings (SGH).

They were so upset by the president's victory-lap tweets that they fast-forwarded past the facts about McCabe's lies.The ABC and NBC morning shows skipped the part about McCabe's ""lack of candor."" They went straight to McCabe's self-defense about being a target of partisans (despite his wife having run for office as a Democrat), not to the honesty problem for career government officials. ABC's Cecilia Vega reported, ""McCabe says he was let go as ' ... part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation ...""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTodd, who claimed he didn't want to be dragged into the political debate, enthusiastically made a guess, saying, ""I think it signals this president is no longer cooperating with Mueller. It's time for war.""The timing of McCabe's sacking looked harsh, since we were routinely told that he had just a few days left to qualify for his FBI pension. So, Todd's NBC colleague Andrea Mitchell even went to Twitter to beg for McCabe to get a job with a Democrat on Capitol Hill, which is what nonpartisan reporters at NBC are supposed to do: ""One suggestion from a McCabe supporter: if a friendly member of Congress hired him for a week he could possibly qualify for pension benefits by extending his service the extra days."" Former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer deliciously tweeted back: ""Pensions before Honesty. Great slogan.""But it turns out the ""pro-truth"" media missed the boat on that claim. McCabe was nearly eligible for pension benefits after 20 years of service, at the age of 50. Now he can't claim them until age 57. Good luck selling that as a terrible scenario to people who retire at the private sector-accepted age of 65, or whose meager pensions don't allow them to retire — ever.None of these not-the-opposition networks noted that McCabe was getting a sweeter treatment by the legal process than retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was forced to plead guilty to lying to the FBI, rather than lying within the FBI. Nobody at the networks protested about a ""war"" on government officials or tweeted out help-the-poor-public-servant messages for Flynn. He deserved every criticism liberals threw his way. CNN mocked Flynn by quoting a tweet about his 24 days as national security adviser: ""I once had a fungal infection that lasted longer than #flynn.""The networks' coverage of Andrew McCabe matches their coverage of everything else in the Trump era. It's not that they look like the Opposition Party. They are the opposition party. Who's telling the truth doesn't matter. Resisting and ruining President Trump is what matters.

102,L,"Stock market futures rose modestly early Friday, with Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all higher.Applied Materials (AMAT) was a big loser on disappointing sales guidance late Thursday. Fellow chip-equipment makers such as Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also retreated. So did memory chip giant Micron Technology (MU).Meanwhile, China search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) fell sharply after announcing a key executive shakeup involving its artificial intelligence efforts.As for stock market futures today, Dow Jones futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced nearly 0.2%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn Thursday's stock market trading, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed with slim losses. Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion. Both comfortably beat analyst views. But the chip-equipment maker sees Q3 revenue of $4.43 billion. That's roughly in line with the Zacks estimate of $4.45 billion, but clearly below other consensus targets for $4.53 billion.Applied Materials fell 5.1% in the premarket, suggesting a move below its 200-day moving average at Friday's open. On Thursday, the stock fell 2.2% to 53.96, once again hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.The Applied Materials stock chart, which previously had been forming a double-bottom base, is starting to look like a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, Lam Research lost about 1.5% early Friday. KLA-Tencor was not yet active Friday but had fallen late Thursday by about 1.5%. Lam has been fighting to hold above its 50-day, while KLA-Tencor is just above that level.Applied Materials is heavily exposed to the memory market, with over half its sales going to the DRAM and flash markets. Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

105,L,"When scientists discovered the immense power contained in an atom, the United States government provided the laboratories, factories, and funding necessary to harness that power and end World War II. It was an unprecedented partnership of science, government, and industry, and it gave rise to the Department of Energy's National Laboratory System.In the decades since, DOE's national labs have provided scientific and technical capabilities essential for national security and competitiveness, including global leadership in supercomputing.When the nation agreed to stop underground testing of nuclear weapons, DOE's supercomputers provided the precise and sophisticated simulations necessary to ensure the arsenal's ongoing effectiveness.When scientists sought to model the universe's evolution, they brought their data to the experts and supercomputers at DOE, where they've also produced 3D images of Earth's interior that aid earthquake resilience, oil and gas discovery, and nuclear nonproliferation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen the automotive industry needed to better understand the chemistry of engine combustion to improve efficiency, DOE's supercomputers did that, too, just as they benefit energy producers with better gas turbines, trucking companies with better aerodynamics, and consumers with better biofuels.The quiet contributions of these incredible machines — and the men and women who use them to solve the toughest problems — have kept the U.S. at the forefront of high-performance computing for decades.We have regularly developed and deployed benchmark systems and set global records for both power and scientific productivity, with an incredible range of basic science and innovation applications that impact practically every facet of our lives.The list is long, from the molecules of the human genome, to the development of new energy technologies, advanced materials and new medicines, to exploration of dark matter and understanding of the universe itself.We can push even further — and we must. It is essential for our scientific community, industry and government to work together to accelerate innovation, just as it was when our National Laboratory System began.Earlier this  month, DOE announced a Request for Proposals, worth up to $1.8 billion, for development of two to three exascale machines. Exascale computers are the next frontier for supercomputing, with speeds of l billion-billion calculations per second, an order of magnitude faster than today's machines.Our first exascale machine, Aurora, is in development at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois and is expected to come online in 2021. Aurora will use processors and architecture designed by Intel in a system built by Cray. It is expected to have more than 50,000 nodes, to use five petabytes (five million-billion bytes) of memory, and will be capable of at least one exaflops, or one quintillion calculations (that's a one followed by 18 zeros) per second.The next exascale machine will be housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, followed by another at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Their unique system designs will allow for distinct problem-solving approaches.Pioneering approaches to system architecture have been a key contribution of DOE national laboratories. The Titan system at ORNL, currently the nation's most powerful, deployed NVIDIA graphics processing units along with traditional central processors to increase computing power without a corresponding increase in electricity consumption. It came online in 2012, and high-performance hybrid supercomputers are now common.Our new exascale machines will allow new breakthroughs in science and industry through modeling and simulation and high-performance data analysis.Expected applications include identifying next-generation materials like exotic alloys for the defense, aerospace and energy sectors, determining optimal cancer treatments based on a patient's unique genetics, refining earth system models to more reliably assess water cycles and agricultural impacts, deciphering high-energy physics data; and accelerating industrial product design.At exascale, researchers will be able to look deeper and see farther than they ever have before. They will develop better answers to bigger questions and take on larger challenges with greater precision and speed. What's more, they will put us on the frontier, not just of exascale, but also of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).We are already developing many cutting edge AI and ML applications for our upcoming Exascale capabilities. DOE's systems have used machine learning to search through a billion combinations of drugs to find those predicted to maximally inhibit a given tumor, to search through a billion hypothetical compounds to identify those with potential as new drug development candidates, to design new materials, to develop new algorithms to manage electric grid operations, and to identify extreme climate events such as hurricanes.That is where DOE's national labs have always been: In the lead. These powerhouses of science and technology have added immeasurably to innovation and scientific discovery, national security and economic prosperity.With this week's announcement, we're on the cusp of a new frontier in supercomputing. We've made amazing progress, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

107,L,"Several weeks ago, the City of New York sued five big oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, for damages related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  According to Mayor Bill de Blasio, greenhouse gas emissions from the production and consumption of fossil fuels precipitated a change in global climate that caused the storm to hit the city.XEight California cities and counties, including Richmond, which is home to a large Chevron refinery, have also filed lawsuits against a range of oil, gas, and coal companies seeking billions of dollars to help pay for past and future damages linked to climate change. Not to be outdone, on January 25 the city of Boulder, Colorado joined the fray by taking legal action to force fossil fuel companies to cover the costs of damages caused by severe past and future weather events.Coupled with legal actions against energy companies, the divestment crusade continues apace.  New York City is liquidating $5 billion of pension funds currently invested in oil and gas companies.  San Francisco, Berkeley, Madison, Wisc., and a number of other cities have also pledged to reduce their pension funds' holdings of fossil fuel companies.Several years ago, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced it would sell all of its fossil fuel company stocks (Is John D. turning in his grave?)  Banks, insurance companies, foundations, faith-based institutions, and universities are also being pressured to get rid of their oil, gas, and coal company investments.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportThe third leg of the ""keep it in the ground"" movement is opposition to energy infrastructure projects like pipelines, gas liquefaction projects, and export facilities.  Though the fights against the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines have gained the most media attention, battles are being waged over dozens of other proposed infrastructure projects, especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast.  Governor Andrew Cuomo's veto of the Constitution Pipeline that could bring cheap natural gas to New York consumers is a prime local example.Regrettably, the anti-fossil fuel movement suffers from both financial and political naiveté.  The costs to local governments of pursuing legal actions of dubious merit against oil and gas companies will mean higher taxes or less revenue available for schools and other municipal services.  Fossil fuel asset prices are unlikely to be affected by divestment, while numerous studies have shown that the pursuit of divestment strategies reduces returns to beneficiaries by decreasing portfolio diversification.What's more, by potentially removing a large and profitable sector of the U.S. and global economies from their portfolios, financial managers may be disregarding their implicit fiduciary responsibilities.Opponents of fossil fuels also fail to acknowledge how the oil and gas industry contributes to America's economic prosperity.  The American Petroleum Institute calculates that more than 11 million jobs nationwide are supported by oil and gas production.At the same time, all U.S. households and businesses benefit from relatively inexpensive and reliable energy supplies that help keep down the costs of heating and cooling, while powering a growing fleet of electronics and appliances in the typical home.  Cheap energy also holds down manufacturing costs while enhancing the competitiveness of American goods in the global marketplace.Finally, the ""keep it in the ground"" movement could use a dose of economic reality. Like it or not, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), despite the growing use of renewables oil and gas will still account for the lion's share of global energy supply in the year 2040.  This offers tremendous opportunities to further enhance America's energy dominance, with all the attendant economic and security benefits, by expanding oil and gas exports even as domestic consumption moderates.But the key to realizing this potential lies with building out the requisite infrastructure of pipelines, liquefied natural gas facilities, and export terminals — a task that has become more difficult and expensive as a result of the growing pushback by anti-carbon activists who are now focused on ""shaming"" financial institutions, foundations, pension funds, and endowments who hold assets or extend credit to fossil fuel companies. You Might Also Like...By Leaving Paris Climate-Change Deal, Trump Will Do U.S. Economy A 'Yuuuge' FavorOther People's Money: The Immorality Of The Fossil-Fuel Divestment CampaignThe Futility Of Divesting From Petroleum PipelinesIs U.S. Fracking Killing OPEC?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

116,L,"Supreme Court retirements under President Trump cause an extra measure of heartburn for Democrats. They nominated Hillary Clinton and her seven-mile train of scandalous baggage for president, and that's jake. They elected Bill Clinton as president, who perjured himself and sullied his office. Not a problem.The one guarantee with Trump appointing Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that the Democrats, fueled by their mindless street mobs, will try to destroy him. It's how Democrats behave. It is not how the ""news"" media should behave. Is there anyone who disputes that? But it is how they will comport themselves, because they are one with their Democratic brothers and sisters.One by one, leftist Democrats have been making preposterous comments since the moment Trump made his announcement. Sen. Kamala Harris, for instance, immediately described Kavanaugh as a deadly threat, saying, ""his nomination presents an existential threat to the health care of hundreds of millions of Americans.""The ""news"" media reaction to Democratic rants? Nothing but airtime.Leftist websites like the Daily Beast presented Trump's short list of candidates as a plot by ""Catholic fundamentalist"" puppet masters. Where are the news reports about Kavanaugh being slandered for his Catholic faith? To beat this old saw, what if National Review had attacked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination as a plot led by Zionist puppet masters? You could have heard journalist heads explode.Instead, reporters like NPR's Nina Totenberg — who not only smeared Associate Justice Clarence Thomas with unsubstantiated sexual harassment bilge but also openly allies herself in public appearances with Justice Ginsburg these days — are warning that Kennedy's retirement will be the ""end of the world as we know it,"" leading to ""a hardcore conservative majority of a kind not seen probably in three-quarters of a century.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo conservatives, that sounds great. But this reaction underlines why people don't trust the liberal-media fun house anymore. Under President Obama, the Democrats tried to socialize health care with Obamacare. They pushed same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court imposed it on 50 states. Obama also imposed radical federal ""guidance"" on public schools with ""inclusive"" policies for transgender students.Our liberal TV anchors and taxpayer-funded Totenbergs never described all this as the ""end of the world as we know it."" It wasn't the work of a ""hardcore leftist"" administration. But now the idea of reversing any of this is called a shift ""sharply to the right.""When Obama nominated then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor and then-Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the court, no journalists talked about extremes. They gushed like schoolgirls. Try ABC's Claire Shipman (Mrs. Jay Carney) on Sotomayor nine years ago. This sounds like an Obama campaign advertisement: ""Even as a little girl, growing up in a drug-ridden South Bronx housing project, stricken with juvenile diabetes, she had that trademark knack: Instead of seeing dead ends, young Sonia saw possibilities. ... She's also an avid Yankees fan, a mean guacamole maker and a fierce biker.""Sotomayor sits at the left-wing extreme of the Supreme Court, but at her confirmation hearings, the networks were in denial. Jan Crawford Greenburg at ABC said, ""Sotomayor ... calmly, persistently, repeatedly ... described herself differently, sounding almost conservative.""But any research seems to bring us back to the eternally shameless Totenberg. She said of Sotomayor, ""In fact, on a lot of criminal law issues, you could say that she's more conservative than some members of the Supreme Court, including Justice Scalia.""When Kagan was nominated in 2010, Totenberg took to NPR and — we're not making this up — put on the theme song of the ""Superman"" TV show from the '50s to compare Kagan, the former Harvard Law School dean, to Superman: ""Kagan, who can raise money by the millions! Kagan, who can end the faculty wars over hiring! Kagan, who won the hearts of students ... !""They are about to show the world what first-class hypocrites they really are.

118,L,"Widely considered one of the best Chinese stocks, TAL Education has a technical picture that looks iffy at best.For starters, it's made a huge price gain in recent years. That raises the question: Has the big money already been made? On top of that, TAL Education (TAL) hasn't undercut the low of a prior base in ages. That means its latest base is later stage. When a stock undercuts the low of a prior base, it usually means enough sellers have been shaken out to pave the way for more gains.But some might argue that TAL Education's pullback of 29% in October was a good shakeout — good enough to reset the base count. It's not a bad argument.But when the stock cleared a conventional entry of 36.26 in February — even if it was viewed as a breakout from an early-stage base — it was a breakout from a faulty base. The base showed several wide-and-loose, erratic price swings. Tight, orderly trading in a base is always preferred. Plus, weekly volume at the breakout was less than impressive.The stock didn't move much after the lukewarm breakout. It's now forming a new cup-type base with a 41.85 buy point. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B points toward decent demand for shares, but an up/down volume ratio of 1.0 Tuesday is less impressive.TAL Education provides K-12 after-school tutoring services in China.

Ratings dipped 5% and 11% in the key demographic for advertisers, a six-year low.Hollywood may finally be getting the message that TV ratings are suffering because the public has grown weary of people turning live events into leftist political rallies.The New York Times reported the Oscars people are worried. ""Whenever stars use the platform to support progressive causes and make political statements, large numbers of viewers turn the channel, according to academy insiders, who cite minute-by-minute Nielsen data for past shows.""Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, said during their Oscars telecast, the campaign against sexual harassment should be limited to a prescheduled ""moment,"" so viewers don't feel it ""overshadows the artists and the films being honored.""

122,L,"If the Academy Awards people wanted to recall how Hollywood has behaved, they would take a ""moment"" to replay the standing ovation for child-raping director Roman Polanski when he won best director in 2003.

It's an awards show for people who have been dreaming about maybe winning an Oscar for their whole lives. And the last thing I want to do is ruin that for someone ... by making it unpleasant.""But will Kimmel lash out at Republicans? When ""Good Morning America"" asked if he's been too political recently and ""pushed the envelope too far,"" he shot back ""Not at all. I don't think you can go too far."" So when it came to sexual assault, Kimmel said, ""I'm not going to stop any bad behavior with my jokes."" But ""making it unpleasant"" for people who couldn't vote for Hillary Clinton is apparently a patriotic duty.Awards shows have been unable to avoid political moments, and viewers are tuning out. The audience for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which began with host Kristen Bell mocking the first lady, plummeted 30% (they were also scheduled against an NFL playoff game). The Grammy Awards — which mocked Donald Trump in a skit featuring celebrities and Hillary Clinton reading passages from Michael Wolff's unsubstantiated trash-for-cash book ""Fire and Fury"" — was off 10 million viewers (24%) for an all-time low.Live events — including sports — are being skipped by people who can't stand the political lectures. NFL ratings, after all the railing against racism, were down nearly 10% this season. NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics — complete with gay Olympians bashing Vice President Pence — was down 7%, making them the least-watched Olympics on record.Even if ABC tries to rein in the Oscars, Americans know that Kimmel and the Hollywood crowd are likely to trash Trump, Pence and the National Rifle Association.

123,L,"Shares of Alibaba stock, one of the best Chinese stocks in recent years, have been suffering from a lack of buying demand. The weakness comes after a bullish follow-through day for the Nasdaq last week.A breakout during the week ended Jan. 26 was powerful as shares of Alibaba (BABA) surged 11.5% in strong volume. But new buyers were disappointed when shares lost nearly 9% the following week in higher volume. Volume during that down week surged 50% above the 10-week average as well.Big sellers in a stock immediately after a breakout is never a good sign. In Alibaba's case, it foreshadowed more price weakness.Alibaba's stock is currently testing support at the 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level. The test comes after Alibaba gapped below the 50-day line on March 22 in heavy volume.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow can a stock like Alibaba turn into a laggard amid seemingly bright fundamentals?Sales growth accelerated nicely in the latest reported quarter, up 66% from a year ago to $12.75 billion. In Q3 last year, the top line increased 47%. For the current quarter, sales are seen rising 52% to $9.28 billion. Annual earnings estimates are also robust, with EPS this year expected to rise 54% from 2017 to $5.27.The lack of buying interest is due, in part, to a slowdown in institutional demand. Alibaba's up-down volume ratio is a tepid 1.0, while its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has faltered to C- on a scale of A to E.Several recent higher-volume declines are the culprit. Alibaba stock is not under heavy distribution, but signs of institutional selling started in early February. Three above-average volume declines from Feb. 1-5 were a sign of it.New signs of institutional buying would strengthen Alibaba's technical picture. Watch for higher-volume gains from here. The stock's 50-day moving average is a potential resistance level to watch. But if mutual funds and other big investors start buying shares again, a move back above the 50-day line is possible.A double-bottom pattern could even form, but note that Alibaba's latest pullback didn't undercut the low of the prior base (164.25). That means any new base that forms would be the third-stage variety after a strong move in 2017. A general rule of thumb is to buy breakouts from early-stage bases, not later-stage patterns.Keep in mind that when stocks move they tend to move in groups, and that appears to be the case with China stocks in general. In the latest IBD 50, for example, buying demand has also dried up in China Lodging (HTHT), TAL Education (TAL) and Weibo (WB).For now, the top China name in the IBD 50 is Baozun (BZUN), which continues to hold near highs.RELATED:Alibaba Invests Another $2 Billion Into Leading SE Asia E-Commerce Site LazadaBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

124,L,"Of all the desperate and futile attempts at revisionist history, few are as careless as the attempt to destroy the reputation of one of the finest Supreme Court justices this country has ever produced.XNow comes another volley. New York magazine has assembled ""The Case for Impeaching Clarence Thomas."" The author is longtime anti-Thomas journalist Jill Abramson. For more than 4,000 words, Abramson labors to relitigate Thomas accuser Anita Hill's dramatic loss in the court of public opinion. According to one poll at the time, only 24% believed her.Again the argument falls on its face.Justice Thomas has been a distinguished member of the Supreme Court for more than 26 years now. In the years since, Abramson has assembled ... well, nothing. Meanwhile, the case against Hill's unproven charges has grown only stronger, and Abramson's record of objectivity — if there ever was one — is evermore tattered. Liberals like her think you should impeach someone for allegedly lying under oath — but not if the person's name is Bill Clinton — and then lean heavily on ""alleged"" for protection.Abramson's newest attraction is attorney Moira Smith, who claims she was groped by Thomas at a 1999 dinner party. Her accusation, delivered in the last days of the 2016 presidential campaign, flopped so badly that ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN never touched it.The rationale for attacking Thomas all over again was the Harvey Weinstein expose. But just since then, Abramson has managed to hurt her own cause again. She has no credibility in this discussion. Indeed, she's on the wrong side of it. In October, the Washington Post reported that as executive editor of The New York Times and deputy to Michael Oreskes, she did nothing to stop Oreskes from allegedly sexually harassing a female news aide in the Washington bureau.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""If I had to do it again, I would have told him to knock it off,"" she said. ""I think I should have raised this with (the Times' human resources department). ... Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another woman.""In November, she wrote an editorial for the leftist British newspaper The Guardian that explicitly argued that feminist politicians shouldn't be ruined by sexual-harassment allegations. It said: ""Casting out Al Franken, who has been a passionate, zealous defender of women's rights in a Senate grown ever more hostile to them, could remove an important weapon in the embattled Democratic arsenal.""A reassessment of Bill Clinton's behavior era could have the same counter-productive effect.""That passage underlines that Abramson isn't really interested in stopping sexual harassment. She's interested in using sexual harassment against opponents of ""women's rights,"" especially abortion on demand.In fact, Abramson's tolerance for former President Clinton's sexual misconduct is this dramatic: A Nexis search of The New York Times for the terms ""Jill Abramson"" and ""Juanita Broaddrick"" brings up zero stories. When she finally acknowledged Broaddrick's existence in October 2016, she dismissed Broaddrick (and other Clinton accusers Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey) as part of a ""Soviet show trial"" before the second presidential debate.Abramson's ""new"" case against Thomas is so unconvincing that the liberal media passed right over it. Oh, she still has a few die-hard friends on the left. Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan touted the New York magazine piece and lauded Abramson as a ""badass"" with ""unparalleled expertise on the subject."" They think alike. Last October, Sullivan also trashed Broaddrick & Co. as ""a twisted version of 'The Last Supper.'""Clarence Thomas has been recognized as a forceful legal mind on the Supreme Court, and he has staunchly argued against liberal barbarism like partial-birth abortion. It's obvious why liberal journalists with no real core principles on sexual harassment wished they had prevented his confirmation, and why Americans would have been denied an impressive justice.Character assassination means never having to say you're sorry.You might also like ...Media Enablers Protected Democratic Predators For YearsYes, Let's Talk About Bill Clinton's MisconductHollywood Moralists Exposed As Hypocrites

CBS insisted we need to ""rethink our attitude"" toward the sin of adultery.It happens in every period of time and every culture, CBS explained.

There should be no villains when infidelity happens, Perel lectured: ""To think about them just as a good person and a bad person does not help the millions of people who are experiencing it -- the children, the friends, the family.""Perel found fault not with cheaters but with those who label them as such. ""We do not claim moral superiority just because we haven't cheated,"" she insisted. ""And just because we haven't had sex with somebody else, we think we are the mature, and the committed, and the superior?

""I pulled my phone out, and I went to my phone and I said, 'woman looking for men to have affairs with,'"" she said. When her husband found text messages from her lover, Kristie says, she just ended it: ""I didn't deny it. I'm like, 'Yup, and I want a divorce.'"" There was no remorse, just relief.Daphne, who also hid behind a screen, said she had a good marriage for 22 years, but her husband has Alzheimer's disease, and morality got in the way.

132,L,"ARLINGTON, Va. —  Light attack aircraft that are less expensive to buy and operate than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) cutting-edge F-35 or older fighters like Boeing's (BA) F-15 could help the U.S. attract new allies, a top Air Force officer said Monday.XThe Air Force is weighing whether light attack aircraft should become part of the U.S. fleet as well, and just began a second phase of experiments to compare Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine against the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano.The A-29, which at $10 million each costs about a tenth of Lockheed's F-35, is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The prospect of sharing an aircraft with the U.S. could be an incentive for countries to increase U.S. ties more broadly.""Lower that cost so we gain new allies with that light attack approach,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements, at a Mitchell Institute event. ""Not every country can afford an F-35 or even an F-15 or F-16. Partner with other countries that haven't been able to do so at this point.""Textron shares closed up 1.4% at 63.88 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last month. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.9%, Lockheed rallied 2%, and Boeing rose 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Air Force hasn't decided yet if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of up to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022. Harris also sounded eager to speed up the process.""We are doing our best to minimize new development and just take existing things on the shelf so we can speed the acquisition to get this in the fight sooner,"" he said.In a series of experiments that started today at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and interoperability tests. The experiments could also include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tests, Harris said.In the first phase of light attack experiments, which took place in August 2017, the Air Force looked at Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) in addition to the AT-6 and A-29. The four planes flew in both day and night tests, with and without weapons.The idea behind light attack aircraft is to save money by using them for more routine missions in low-risk environments, and deploy top-of-the-line, fifth-generation aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters for missions in more dangerous environments.Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano, for example, would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.""The price-per-kill today using precision weapons aboard fifth-gen fighters is exorbitant, "" Harris said.

134,L,"In the liberal mind, the way to prove you value something is by funding it with taxpayer money. So if you love journalism, you take taxpayer money and give it to journalists.It is a sacred mantra of the left that corporate funding of media inevitably results in a pro-corporate media bias. Consistency would dictate that government funding of media would lead to a pro-government bias.Not in New Jersey. The idea of the press as a check and a balance on government has just been placed on the Jersey Turnpike and squashed to pieces.Garden State legislators have approved a bill to use taxpayer money to support ""grants to strengthen local news coverage,"" starting with a $5 million kitty. The goal when the bill was first introduced was to have $20 million allocated toward the ""civic information"" fund every year for five years.""Particularly during these uncertain times, we need a strong and free press, which we know is the best safeguard for truth in our state and the country,"" State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg declared.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOne reason Republicans in Congress never have the nerve to defund (or even cut) public broadcasting is fear of terrible publicity — not just from public radio and TV stations but from journalists in general. It's not state-run TV, just statist-run TV.Legislators argue that the state's location between large media markets in New York City and Philadelphia lead to poor coverage of ""hyperlocal issues"" for most of the state. But CNN's Brian Stelter was thrilled about going nationwide with this socialist notion. He tweeted, ""What if every state provided some seed $$$ for local journalism — as a way to rebuild some of what's been lost through years of"" — private sector — ""budget cuts and layoffs?""The socialist advocacy group Free Press has been pushing for this for years, alongside its efforts to prevent any public broadcasting funding cuts. ""Never before has a state taken the lead to address the growing crisis in local news,"" proclaimed Mike Rispoli, the New Jersey director of the Free Press Action Fund. They talk in panicky tones about the ""disappearance"" of local news.The question liberals never ask is this: Are newspapers and TV stations losing their audience because they're too liberal? You can't fix that by doubly reinforcing Democrat-friendly government-funded local news operations. Last year, The New York Times mourned layoffs at The Record of Bergen County because it broke the vastly overhyped Bridgegate scandal against former Gov. Chris Christie. To The Times, that's a triumph of ""news."" To Republicans, it reeks of a partisan media bias.It also makes you wonder why any private-sector investor would try to bail out such a failing effort. Media owners like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos or Carlos Slim get hailed as philanthropists for bailing out the liberal media. If you can't make a profit, you can at least improve your own public relations.Obviously, the collapse of classified-advertising revenue and the rise of online news have caused major problems for newspapers. Let us agree for the sake of argument that a) this affects local news more than national news and b) local news should be covered.There are a growing number of liberal multibillionaires who could easily throw $5 million at this New Jersey effort instead of the government. Men like George Soros have poured millions of dollars into journalism to promote their political agenda, so why not ""hyperlocal"" news?

136,L,"Anyone who walks past a newsstand knows that Time magazine hates Donald Trump. Don't doubt us. You'd lose.In 2016, it pictured his orange face melting on the cover and then, months later, that same face melted into an orange puddle. Time considered it unthinkable that he would win. Then, once he won, two different covers imagined an endangered President Trump in the middle of a raging storm.On the cover of the latest issue, he looks into a mirror and sees himself as a king with a crown. The title is ""KING ME. Visions of Absolute Power.""It all depends on which political party you like. Time can joyously assign royal qualities to some presidents. When Barack Obama won the White House, he was a prince, not unlike Jesus Christ. Time wrote: ""Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers. But a few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope.""Passages like that make one thing clear: Anyone who thinks Time is a ""news magazine"" hasn't opened one since disco roller-skating was fashionable.Inside this latest edition, a warning headline reads, ""The War on Mueller: Donald Trump's Campaign to Discredit the Russia Investigation May Be Working. It's Also Damaging American Democracy."" Compare that to this: On Feb. 9, 1998, just days after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, the Time cover showed a photo of Ken Starr and was titled ""Starr At War: As the Clintons Strike Back, the Prosecutor Struggles to Build His Case.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThen-President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's bashing of the independent prosecutor as the fanged head of a ridiculous ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" was not described by the Time crowd as damaging to our democracy. Instead, it proclaimed: ""Starr's own methods are not always easy to stomach. Going after the President's sex life, wiring Linda Tripp to secretly tape Lewinsky, trying to persuade Lewinsky to tape Clinton -- are those the actions of a conscientious prosecutor or a political hit man?""But in special counsel Robert Mueller, Time has found a white knight to bring down the evil King Trump. A year ago, it called Mueller ""The Lie Detector"" on the cover and proclaimed: ""It goes back to the Greeks, who understood that the peril of kings was hubris, and that hubris was an invitation to the avenging goddess called Nemesis. In Robert Mueller, Trump may have found his.""In the latest edition, Time claims Mueller is a ""lifelong Republican"" and then just lists Trump attacks on his team, ""not all of which are accurate."" So when Trump charged that the Mueller team has ""13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans,"" Time would say that's not true because Mueller is a Republican. Time left out that this ""Republican"" signed up 13 Democratic lawyers, six of whom donated to Hillary Clinton. One even represented the Clinton Foundation in court.Time briefly admits that ""This playbook"" against prosecutors ""has been run before by Clinton"" but quickly pivots to how Trump's strategy ""involves asserting increasingly broad claims of presidential impunity,"" the kind of ""unchecked power Americans have bridled against from the moment they broke with the British monarchy in the 18th century."" Trump had claimed the power to pardon himself.But Trump as king is apparently too gentle a metaphor. Time found an anonymous Republican congressman to compare the Trump White House to ... al-Qaida. ""This is not a coordinated caliphate,"" he told Time. ""This is al-Qaeda, where everyone is their own cell, lobbing Molotov cocktails, firing at will.""So Barack Obama blurs with Jesus; Robert Mueller brings to mind a Greek goddess; and Team Trump is like a group of mass-murdering terrorists. This is why you spit when these ink-stained partisans call themselves the ""mainstream media.""Other columns by L. Brent Bozell and Tim Graham.

138,L,"Who knew we would look back at Roseanne Barr's crotch-grabbing massacre of the national anthem in 1990 and see a mere flesh wound on her career? She embarrassed herself, mocking America in front of America, but her hit show rolled along.But one egregiously racist tweet destroyed the ""Roseanne"" reboot of 2018 in a Hollywood minute. Tweeting that former Barack Obama top aide Valerie Jarrett is a mixture of the Muslim Brotherhood and ""Planet of the Apes"" put an abrupt end to the top broadcast television program of the year.ABC made the right decision — and the obvious business decision. You cannot compare blacks to monkeys. That is an old, dehumanizing trope. It is viciously mean-spirited to compare President Donald Trump to an orangutan, as many leftists have. But that is a mockery of one man's hair and intelligence, not the rhetorical equivalent of a burning cross.In retrospect, everyone said ABC should have known this was going to happen. Barr has always been a loose cannon, and her politics have zigzagged from running on the presidential ticket of the nutty-left Green Party all the way over to backing Trump. But the network thrived with the original formula of ""Roseanne,"" and it saw a win-win with a reboot: The show's old audience would tune in, and ABC could sell itself as reaching out to the red states after mysteriously dumping Tim Allen's hit show. The ratings were terrific. Then Roseanne drove the reboot over a cliff.Dehumanizing tropes about black people don't always destroy careers ... when the black is a Republican. For example, Pat Oliphant didn't stop being the most widely syndicated political cartoonist in the world after he drew then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a parrot with large lips sitting on then-President George W. Bush's hand in 2008.This was a trend. Christian Science Monitor cartoonist Jeff Danziger drew a barefoot Rice in a rocking chair saying, ""I knows all about aluminum tubes! (Correction) I don't know nuthin' about aluminum tubes ..."" In the radical fever swamps, cartoonist Ted Rall drew one with Rice saying, ""I was Bush's beard! His house n----!"" And a black male character replies, ""Now hand over your hair straightener.""

139,L,"Months ago, the Old Media proclaimed that President Donald Trump was more than a bit nutty in insisting his campaign was the subject of surveillance by the Obama administration. Now it's emerging that this wasn't the slightest bit nutty.The New York Times reported — in a tone much like having its fingernails dragged across a chalkboard — that the FBI used an ""informant"" (not a ""spy""!) to chat up (and in one case, dangle money at) Trump staffers and investigate Russian finagling with the 2016 election.As one might expect, since this is considered a ""pro-Trump"" narrative, it must be shot down, even as the facts are coming together. Writing in the Daily Beast, ""conservative"" CNN political commentator Matt Lewis warned that ""there are tens of millions of Americans living in this alternative universe"" who think this spying on ""inexperienced and sketchy"" Trump campaign aides was ""nefarious."" ""(Y)ou have to believe that the intelligence community is wholly corrupt and utterly politicized — that there was a conspiracy (at least, at the top) to stop Trump from becoming president,"" he said. ""(T)his requires a conspiratorial mind.""That's funny. Right after the election, that was the sour-grapes line from Team Clinton. A ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" at the FBI under former Director James Comey conspired to stop Clinton from becoming president with his blundering announcements about her private email server. But that wasn't considered nutty. That was what good Democrats believed. Once Trump fired Comey, the campaign conspiracy narrative switched sides.Here's what conservatives can declare to Matt Lewis: Our media are wholly corrupt and utterly politicized and were transparently dedicated to stopping Trump from becoming president. That's not a kooky conspiracy theory. No one who witnessed their reporting in 2015 and 2016 should doubt it. It would not have been difficult for Team Obama to collude with them.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWe would ask Lewis: Doesn't pushing the idea that Trump colluded with the Russians require ""a conspiratorial mind""? Is it fair to speculate endlessly on CNN and MSNBC about how special counsel Robert Mueller might prove collusion, when he hasn't done so after a year of trying? The media don't have to prove their Trump conspiracy theory to damage Trump's political standing. It can keep that black cloud of speculation hanging over his head on every front page and every newscast.Try this intellectual exercise: Imagine that the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush had sent a spy/informant into the Obama campaign in 2008 to see whether foreign powers were attempting to influence its ""inexperienced and sketchy"" aides. Hundreds of media heads would have exploded.Now we're at a point where we should be asking what Obama's top intelligence hacks, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan, were cooking in 2016. But guess what. CNN hired Clapper, and NBC News hired Brennan. Now they are paid by the networks to tell the folks at home that Trump is nutty for insisting they did anything nefarious. Were Clapper and Brennan leaking anti-Trump dirt to the networks that have since hired them? Wouldn't that look ""wholly corrupt and utterly politicized""?John Fund wrote in National Review that while in a greenroom of a network, he asked a journalist this question: Can't the media spend time exploring why Team Obama sent a spy/informant into the opposing party's campaign? ""There's only room for one narrative on all this,"" the reporter replied. ""And it's all about Trump."" So much for following the facts wherever they lead instead of carefully curating facts against Trump.Why must Matt Lewis and his media pals bemoan ""two Americas"" — one painted as soberly fact-based and the other destined for a rubber room — instead of considering both narratives?Spying On Trump: Was Obama Behind CIA, FBI Plan To Elect Hillary?As Evidence Piles Up, The Media Ignore The 'Other' Trump-Russia ScandalOther columns by L.

146,L,"The school shooting in Parkland, Florida, shows how quickly our media elites move horrors from tragedy to political opportunity. They amplified the loudest voices of the shooting aftermath: teenage survivors who demanded gun control ""solutions"" like banning all semi-automatic assault weapons. These teenagers might accomplish in one week what the anti-Second Amendment crowd, led by these same media elites, has failed to do for decades.Survivors of failed abortions (like Gianna Jessen or Melissa Ohden) have never held their attention for five seconds. That conflicts with the narrative.Liberal journalists have openly discussed how these teenage advocates could be a crucial factor in defeating the gun-rights lobby. They could become the key to the kind of turnout necessary for putting Democrats in the majority in Congress. So they gave them every opportunity to push for liberal victory without any need to be civil.David Hogg, the most prominent student survivor, went on CNN and proclaimed politicians shouldn't take money from the National Rifle Association because they are ""child murderers."" CNN morning anchor Alisyn Camerota didn't correct him — or condemn his statement, regardless of the fact that he'd just stained the reputations of millions of NRA members by labeling them killers. She said nothing. She was satisfied — pleased, in fact. CNN.com happily posted the clip with the headline ""Shooting Survivor Calls NRA 'Child Murderers.'""CNN's motto is ""Facts First.""CNN hosted a ""town hall"" full of leftist rage against anyone who believes in Second Amendment rights. Their agenda was obvious from the program's title: ""Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action."" They used the hashtag #StudentsStandUp to promote it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch were verbally slashed by the students without mercy.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSurvivor Cameron Kasky stood a few feet from Rubio and smeared him on national television: ""it's hard to look at you and not look down the barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz, but the point is you're here, and there are some people who are not."" Kasky also said he wished he could have questioned ""the NRA lady"" (Loesch), since he ""would ask her how she can look in the mirror, considering the fact she has children, but, you know, maybe she avoids those.""In the next hour, when Loesch was on, people in the audience shouted ""murderer,"" and ""burn her,"" and student survivor Emma Gonzalez lectured her that she would be a better mother: ""Dana Loesch, I want you to know that we will support your two children in the way that ... you will not.""Moderator Jake Tapper allowed the audience to be as immoderate as it wanted. He tweeted afterward: ""People freestyled a bit"" — a bit? — ""and I wasn't inclined to reprimand a school shooting survivor or parent who lost a child for expressing him or herself in a question — even if aggressively.""But this is the most amazing part. In the aftermath, no one in television ""news"" replayed the students' rudeness as a storyline worthy of condemnation, or even comment. It matched their own political agenda and emotional temperature. When Rep. Joe Wilson yelled, ""You lie!"" at then-President Obama in 2009, these networks all angrily replayed it ad infinitum as a national disgrace. They called it ""infamous."" CNN's headline on the video clip read ""The Heckling Heard 'Round the World.""Even Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito shaking his head at the 2010 State of the Union was projected as inappropriate.Remember these student hecklers when CNN and their colleagues decry how President Donald Trump has single-handedly ruined civil discourse. Trump mocking CNN as ""fake news"" caused far more media outrage than Hogg calling the NRA ""child murderers.""It will happen again and again.

When former FBI Director James Comey's publisher, Macmillan, boasts that it will kill enough trees to print 850,000 copies — when a decent fraction of sales is in e-books and audiobooks — publicity is clearly booming.The ""news"" media are stuffing Comey's pockets with book profits, just as they're drooling over the possibility of a similar boom in their ad revenues. ""Telling all"" about Trump is a proven get-rich-quick scheme.Macmillan already made one mint this year with all the publicity granted to Michael Wolff's tabloidish Trump-bashing mess ""Fire & Fury."" How much better will the publisher do with the former head of the FBI? The national media lined up to provide Comey with publicity, a queue stretching endlessly. It started with ABC, which provided an hourlong prime-time special hosted by George Stephanopoulos.The funniest line in the ABC promos was ""Nothing's off limits."" ABC used to boast the same thing when promoting prime-time Hillary Clinton book specials, which was silly. Everyone knew Barbara Walters wasn't going to ask Clinton about her strange luck in cattle futures, or illegal donations from the Chinese during then-President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, or her husband's sexual assault or — well, you get the picture. Nothing's off limits except for that which ABC doesn't want discussed.Anyone who expected Stephanopoulos would display an ounce of objectivity in this interview doesn't know Stephanopoulos. He did more facilitating than questioning. There are more worn-out Trump memes than news. Trump looked orange! He has small hands! He acted like a mob boss! He might be subject to blackmail by the Russians! It's entirely possible that he hired Russian prostitutes to urinate on a bed in Moscow! He's morally unfit for office!Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhere is the ""news"" in this? Where is the evidence? Where is the substance? This former FBI leader is a disgrace, and ABC was his enabler.The only time Stephanopoulos showed any aggression was when he forwarded Hillary Clinton's anger at Comey for ruining her chances. Stephanopoulos channeled the anger over Comey's original on-camera announcement in July that though there was no reason to prosecute Clinton, she was extremely careless with classified documents: ""Your critics say this is where your ego got the best of you. This was your original sin?""""Original sin""? What theologian penned this question?Stephanopoulos scolded Comey for having decided he had an obligation to inform Congress he was reopening the Clinton probe 11 days before the election: ""Boy, you seem to be alone in that judgment. You look at previous attorney generals for President Bush, for President Ford, for President Obama, Justice Department officials for President Clinton; they all disagree with you. They say this crossed a line.""Stephanopoulos even said, ""there's no precedent for putting out information like this at the end of a campaign?"" How quickly he forgot that on the last Friday of the 1992 campaign, ""independent counsel"" Lawrence Walsh indicted former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-Contra scandal and released a pile of former President Reagan's administration memos.Stephanopoulos worked as Bill Clinton's communications director that year. CNN's Larry King interviewed then-President George H.W. Bush live in Wisconsin on that fateful Friday night, and CNN let Stephanopoulos call in and accuse President Bush of having lied when he denied knowing of an arms-for-hostages swap.The networks, then and now, act as conveyor belts for ""news"" that makes Democrats happy or lets Democrats vent about what (and who) they hate.

We know the Trump haters erupted when Sanders merely asked reporters to share what they were thankful for alongside their questions as Thanksgiving approached. Imagine an exchange like this:NBC reporter Peter Alexander: ""Sarah, how could you possibly not know about these charges, and how could Porter be praised as a good man? And why can't you offer us more transparency on the vetting process?""Sanders: ""OK, let me ask you: How could you at NBC possibly not know about the accusations of Matt Lauer aggressively propositioning women, even having a button under his desk that he could press to lock the door behind female employees? He worked at the top of NBC News for two decades, and nobody knew these women were suffering?""Alexander: ""Stop distracting. That's none of your business. We're a private company.

How transparent was NBC in investigating Brian Williams' lying on talk shows about all his amazing adventures in war zones? Next question.""Jim Acosta, CNN: ""Hold on! Aren't you and the president putting democracy in danger when you try to undermine the respectability of the press corps?""Sanders: ""Jim, should we revisit the respectability of CNN? Your network accepted Saddam Hussein's claim that we bombed a baby-formula factory in Iraq. Your network's founder, Ted Turner, went to North Korea and then told Wolf Blitzer he didn't see any brutality, just thin people riding bicycles. Are you serving democracy with this kind of journalism?""Acosta: ""That's not fair.

Or that three reporters had to resign from your network for spreading 'fake news' about Anthony Scaramucci having a secret meeting with the Russians? Your 'Facts First' apple is looking wormy and bruised.""This would probably drive the media further around the bend than they already are. But this is why Trump backers think it's smart for the president to avoid 27-question press beatings. Trump backers remember when CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny, then a New York Times reporter, asked President Obama at the 100-day mark of his presidency, ""What has ...

162,L,"Watching how a stock behaves after a strong breakout is vital. If a stock holds firm near a certain price level for at least three straight weeks, it can give the alert investor a chance to add shares to an already profitable investment.IBD has a simple name for this follow-up buying opportunity: the three-weeks-tight pattern.First of all, what does ""follow-up"" mean?In a bull market, the first time to buy a stock is when it clears the proper buy point of a primary base pattern. These patterns include the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base and base-on-base. If the stock's breakout is healthy, you should establish a full-size position in the stock.The follow-up buy should only be a fraction of the full-size position. If you buy the same number of shares as the first purchase, your average cost will go up dramatically. This leaves you more vulnerable to a loss if the stock pulls back to its buy point.One element of a good base is narrow trading action — both in the size of its swings from high to low, and how it closes. A stock that closes at 40 one week, 32 the next and 39 a week later is showing the opposite of price tightness; it means market players have mixed views about the company's future. This can lead to false rallies.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLet's assume a stock rallies 5%, 10% or more from its proper buy point then refuses to give up ground.During that holding period, study the stock's weekly chart. If shares close at nearly the same price in prior weeks, a light bulb should shine inside your head. This behavior suggests overall demand for the stock is exceptionally high.The time to add shares is when the stock climbs past the highest level in the tight pattern in heavy volume. You might also find a lower buy point where the stock faced an area of upward resistance. Don't add the same amount of shares as when you bought on the breakout. Be happy with a small amount; you don't want to aggressively raise the average share cost of your position too fast.Not all three-weeks-tight patterns work. A sudden spate of bad economic or corporate news can drown a stock in sellers. So could a major market top.Also keep in mind that the three-weeks-tight pattern does not appear often. But it tends to show up during the run of an exceptional market leader.If the width between the highest close and the lowest close exceeds 1% to 2%, it's probably not a three-weeks-tight. Volume during those weeks is usually quiet, but that's not an absolute requirement.Limited Brands, now known as L Brands (LB), helped lead the bull market that began in August of 1982. In 1978 to 1979, the women's clothing chain suffered a huge slide from 22.50 to as low as 4. But the stock marched back to 16 by May of 1981 before weaving a long cup with a long handle (1).L Brands cleared its handle in three straight up weeks on accelerating volume (2). By early May, the stock climbed nearly 30% above its 15.98 buy point. Mild pullbacks to its 10-week moving average gave holders chances to add shares (3).In mid-August of 1982, the market indexes followed through vigorously. L Brands thrust ahead 44% in just three weeks (4). While a typical growth stock would peak after such a huge run, L Brands barely budged the next three weeks (5). It closed at 28.25, 28.25 and 28. The weekly spread between the closes was less than 1%. That's tight action.L Brands resumed its huge run in the week ended Oct. 1. The stock passed its 29.60 buy point on two days of gains on above-average trade. The rally that followed was stunning; it ramped up another 325% by July 1983, making a pair of 2-for-1 splits along the way.L Brands corrected sharply for 11 months, built a new base and broke out again in January 1985. That breakout ushered a 465% gain over the next 2-1/2 years.(A version of this column was originally published in the Aug. 4, 2010, edition of IBD.

164,L,"A report that Apple (AAPL) is developing its own device displays using next-generation MicroLED screens took down shares of Universal Display (OLED), a provider of an alternative display technology.Bloomberg reported Sunday that Apple has made a significant investment in MicroLED or light-emitting diode displays. The screens use different compounds than the organic light-emitting diode, or OLED displays that Universal provides. The MicroLED screens, though, offer similar advantages — such as slimmer screens and lower power consumption than liquid-crystal display, or LCD screens. Apple is designing and producing MicroLED displays in test quantities at a secret manufacturing plant near its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Bloomberg said.MicroLED displays are much more difficult to produce than OLED displays and it could be a few years before they are used in Apple products, like the Apple Watch and iPhone, Bloomberg said.Universal Display shares plunged 12.1% to close at 109 on the stock market today. The Ewing, N.J.-based company is a key supplier of technology and materials used to make OLED displays.

165,L,"Every two years, Americans unite around the television to root for U.S. athletes, to see their dreams of gold medals come true — unless you're a journalist, in which case the Olympics are a time to root against your country on the world stage.XAt the opening ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea, organizers strangely seated Vice President Mike Pence just a few feet from Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korea's communist dictator, Kim Jong Un. To American reporters who hate President Trump, a star was born. The summaries of Jong on Twitter alone were enough to make you throw your phone across the room.Start with the wire services. The Associated Press gushed, ""The trip by Kim Yo Jong is the latest move in an extraordinary show of Olympic diplomacy with Seoul that could prove to be a major challenge to the Trump administration's hard-line Korea policies."" Reuters echoed, ""North Korea has emerged as the early favorite to grab one of the Winter Olympics' most important medals: the diplomatic gold.""The newspapers also claimed that Pence lost to the woman who serves as the North Korean deputy director of propaganda. A New York Times headline read, ""Kim Jong Un's Sister Turns on the Charm, Taking Pence's Spotlight."" It turned to history professor Alexis Dudden, who specializes in Asian countries, for the slam dunk. She said, ""The fact that he and Mrs. Pence didn't stand when the unified (Korean) team came in was a new low in a bullying type of American diplomacy.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe Washington Post front page on Sunday declared that it had found the ""Ivanka Trump of North Korea."" Jung ""has enraptured people in looks-obsessed South Korea with her sphinxlike smile and low-key beauty,"" the story read. And her attendance at the Olympics was ""a signal that North Korea is not this crazy, weird former Cold War state — but it too has young women that are capable and are the future leadership.""This kind of truth-shredding article makes a mockery of all the Post's indignant ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" bravado. One might totally forget that last May, when Trump called the North Korean dictator a ""pretty smart cookie,"" the Post ran a story headlined ""Praise for Strongmen Alarms Rights Advocates"" with the subheading ""Trump's vocal affection for totalitarians marks major U.S. policy shift.""The biggest target for outrage on Twitter was CNN, which announced, ""Kim Jong Un's sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics,"" and included a link to an article. It began, ""If 'diplomatic dance' were an event at the Winter Olympics, Kim Jong Un's younger sister would be favored to win gold.""That was in addition to a piece CNN ran with the headline ""North Korea Is Winning the Olympics — and It's Not Because of Sports."" It insisted, without the slightest hint of irony or introspection, that ""the North has gotten the kind of publicity money can't buy.""CNN also brought its academic expert. ""The North is masterful at getting something for nothing,"" David Maxwell of Georgetown University proclaimed. ""They're going to get recognition, legitimacy, resources, without giving anything up.""This is a complete flip-flop from last May. When Trump called the North Korean tyrant a ""pretty smart cookie,"" CNN anchor Jake Tapper brought the brutal facts, saying: ""Kim Jong Un had his uncle murdered. That does not make Kim Jong Un a smart cookie. That makes him a murderer.""If our media elite truly revered democracy and loathed totalitarianism, none of this sugar-coated nonsense on North Korean ""mastery"" would have been uttered or published.

He also cited ""good sales momentum.""Demand is high for housing, especially among first-time buyers, a key customer group for the entry-level homes KB Home specializes in.""The Spring selling season is off to a strong start,"" KB Home said, citing the solid orders figures.That could be welcome news for the likes of LGI Homes (LGIH), PulteGroup (PHM) and M.D.C.

Pulte Group erased reversed from early gains to sink 1.2%, M.D.C. Holdings lost 1.9%, NVR fell 1% and D.R. Horton (DHI) dipped 0.6%.The triple-leveraged ETF Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers (NAIL) fell 3.3%, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) ETF lost 1.7%, adding to Thursday's big losses.Wedbush Securities analyst Jay McCanless says KB Home could fuel a groupwide price surge that would help many move above their 50-day lines, a key technical support, for the first time in months.""Given we haven't seen any company-specific data for a couple of weeks, if we were to see KB beat on both orders and revenues it could be a tailwind for the group,"" McCanless said in an interview. ""We have got a mixed picture on housing from the macro data, so if we get an across-the-board beat from one of the bigger entry-level homebuilders, it could send up stocks in the group as a whole.""Positive comments on pricing trends, such as input costs, would be further catalyst, he added. Another boost for the firm is the fact that housing supply in California has shrunk over the last year, while it also dominates the list of America's least-affordable markets.""KB focuses on California, and a lot of builders are invested in that state. If during the earnings call they have good things to say about California it could also positively impact the group,"" McCanless said.There have already been two positive indications for entry-level demand, he said, namely LGI Homes' strong comparable closing sales in January and February and William Lyon Homes' (WLH) purchase of privately held RSI Communities, which focuses on entry-level buyers.But recent housing data have been mixed. New-home sales retreated significantly in December and January on a seasonally adjusted basis. New-home sales unexpectedly dipped in February, the Commerce Department said Friday.But existing-home sales rose in February, the National Association of Realtors said earlier in the week.The number of first-time buyers tumbled by 31% year-over-year, accounting for 29% of transactions in February. According to realtors and economists, this number should be at 40% for a robust housing market.To make matters worse for buyers, pricing gains are outpacing wage growth, even though the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. A strong labor market increases demand for housing, making the shortage issue even more problematic.Expectations of improved wage gains and continued solid hiring — along with millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the suburbs — should keep demand strong, however, despite the rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage last week nearing a four-year high of 4.46%.Homebuilders are working to ease the supply squeeze, and the government reported last Friday that in February the number of single-family housing units under construction was at its highest level since June 2008.

170,L,"Two days of congressional hearings with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg underlined how American perceptions of media power are changing. After 2012, Democrats and their media allies oozed over the way former President Barack Obama's brilliant strategists changed the face of campaigning through Facebook. But in 2016, Donald Trump was elected, and Facebook became a malignant ghetto of ""fake news"" and inappropriate election manipulation.Congress is justified in asking how Facebook's massive popularity could also lead to massive violations of privacy and, potentially, international manipulation in our political process. But there is more to discuss, questions of bias and censorship that the left doesn't want to cover, and for good reason. It's guilty of that.Several Republican senators underlined conservatives' fears about what Facebook is becoming now that it's under pressure from leftist elites to ban free speech. Sen. Ben Sasse asked Zuckerberg how he defines ""hate speech,"" noting that many young people find the First Amendment allows too much hurtful speech. He couldn't really answer it. But in his opening statement, he insisted Facebook has to ""make sure people aren't using it to hurt people or spread misinformation.""Sen. Ted Cruz zeroed in on the hard evidence of Facebook demonstrating a ""pervasive pattern of political bias."" Gizmodo reported in 2016 that Facebook insiders revealed the social media giant kept major conservative stories like ones on Conservative Political Action Conference off its ""trending"" topics for readers. Facebook shut down the ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day page,"" blocked a post by Fox News reporter Todd Starnes, has blocked over two dozen Catholic pages and recently declared the videos of pro-Trump black ladies known as Diamond and Silk ""unsafe for the community.""To his credit, Zuckerberg replied, ""I understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place."" Just acknowledging that reality caused the liberals to tear their hair out.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut then Cruz asked whether Zuckerberg had ever heard of a Planned Parenthood page being taken down. No. How about a MoveOn.org page? No. Any Democratic candidate pages? No. Nobody's aware of that happening. But we can suspect that Facebook's content police have an itchy trigger finger in identifying where conservatives ""hurt people or spread misinformation.""Conservatives are used to the national media excluding our viewpoint or loading up a pundit panel with eight liberals and one marginal Republican. We're not going to be happy if the social media start hindering us from communicating with one another on what Zuckerberg claims is a ""platform for all ideas.""Zuckerberg recently told the leftist blog Vox that Facebook plans to boost ""broadly trusted news sources"" like The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (national media elites) as opposed to looking ""down to blogs that may be on more of the fringe."" Would it be wrong to see ourselves in that ""fringe""? We are certainly not placing our trust in The New York Times. But the Facebook founder explained they would like to ""help these news organizations, drive subscriptions.""For all of Zuckerberg's willingness to acknowledge the bias in Big Tech, he needs to acknowledge that conservatives have news outlets, too, like our CNSNews.com. Showing favoritism toward building the profits and influence of liberal media elites is taking sides, not offering a neutral forum for all.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Meet The New Censors: Facebook's Zuckerberg, Twitter's Dorsey And YouTube's WojcickiZuckerberg Starts Talking, And Makes Facebook's Problems Even WorseFacebook Needs To Answer For How It Helped Obama Win In 2012

171,L,"Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 79 to 82 Thursday. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.IBD's unique RS Rating identifies technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. Over 100 years of market history shows that the top-performing stocks often have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their biggest price moves.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereHi-Crush Partners broke out earlier, but is now approximately 3% below the prior 13.35 entry from a double bottom. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth rose last quarter from 0% to 942%, but revenue fell from 222% to 162%. The company holds the No. 10 rank among its peers in the Chemicals-Specialty industry group. Orion Engineered Carbns (OEC), KMG Chemicals (KMG) and Balchem (BCPC) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

172,L,"A Wall Street analyst on Monday cut his price targets on four chip-gear stocks, saying the market for wafer fabrication equipment — especially for memory chips — has softened recently.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered his targets on Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holding (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX).He kept his positive ratings on Applied Materials, ASML and Lam Research and neutral rating on Advanced Energy. Hosseini cut his target on Advanced Energy to 68 from 80.

""Underlying demand dynamics remain unchanged: increased enterprise/cloud spend somewhat offset by weaker consumer (i.e., mobile).""While weaker equipment shipments for the second half of 2018 have been factored into expectations for chip-gear stocks, lower shipments for first-half 2019 have not, Hosseini said.The state of the semiconductor capital equipment market will be a major topic at the Semicon West conference this week in San Francisco. The three-day show officially opens Tuesday.Memory-chip makers, most notably Samsung, have cut back on new production equipment, Hosseini said. The memory chip industry has matured and become more rational and thus is reluctant to invest ahead of demand, he said.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley on Monday also cut its price targets on Applied Materials and Lam Research.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight ratings on both stocks. But he cut his target on Applied Materials to 58 from 60 and on Lam to 219 from 238.Both will be impacted by ""short-term pushouts"" of equipment orders, he said.

The stocks generally are not loners, but are joined by strong performances from industry peers or the broader group.The stocks also boast strong Composite Ratings. Weibo has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, with ASML and TAL Education at 98 and Charles Schwab a 97. First Solar has just an 81 CR, reflecting choppy earnings. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary ratings, including on earnings and other key metrics.

Flir, L-3 and Huntington Ingalls rallied about 3%.Boeing (BA), which makes nuclear missiles, satellites, the F/A-18 Super Hornet and other aircraft for the Pentagon, is a big winner in the defense budget.

Boeing shares are losing sight of their 50-day moving average after breaking through that support line earlier this month.Boeing shares jumped 2.5% Monday amid reports that the U.S. and China are in talks to avert U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

175,L,"The problem with investing is you can lose money — and sometimes a lot of it.Investors in VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange-Traded Note (XIV) learned that the hard way. The product blew up and has since been liquidated, leaving investors with big losses. Now, they're suing Credit Suisse Group (CS), the note's issuer, and Janus Index & Calculation Services, the publisher of the note's intraday indicative value and closing indicative value.XIV was one of 19 exchange-traded products that tracked the Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX. XIV wasn't an ETF, but an exchange-traded note (ETN). ETNs don't hold underlying securities, like stocks or bonds. They're unsecured debt instruments issued by a bank that promises to pay the performance of an index. XIV promised to pay the inverse of the VIX. If the VIX went down, XIV would go up that amount, and vice versa. It did this by buying and shorting VIX futures.XIV had become popular because over the previous five years it had returned 2,200%, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Then on Feb. 5, the VIX jumped 100%. Reports say the note's price was $72.59 at 4 p.m. ET and fell to $4.22 by 5:10 p.m., during which time its indicative value was not updated every 15 seconds as was typical. Janus Index & Calculation Services was responsible for providing the estimates of the note's value. Because the note had lost more than 90% of its value, Credit Suisse enacted a provision the next day to close the ETN to prevent further losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The issuers build in a cushion so that if it lost 70% of its value, it liquidates. It's all done,"" said Peter Shea, partner at law firm K&L Gates. ""In this instance, the VIX shot up so high it ate into about all their cushion by the end of the day.""The investors are suing, saying they suffered damages because they relied ""on the integrity of the market, they paid artificially inflated prices for the Notes. Plaintiff and the Class would not have purchased the Notes at the prices they paid, or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by defendants' misleading statements,"" according to court documents.Credit Suisse told IBD: ""The publicly available prospectus accurately and fully disclosed the risks of an investment in XIV, which is only intended for sophisticated institutional clients. Credit Suisse did not engage in any conduct designed to mislead investors regarding XIV's value or cause the Feb. 5, 2018, decline in XIV's price.""Janus was not available for comment.""People will sue because they'll say that they didn't realize they would get liquidated and have their losses locked in. In other words, they didn't read the prospectus,"" Shea said. ""It's a very sophisticated product and a lot of people don't have the basics to understand it or have simplified disclosure to educate themselves on the basics of it, so a lot of retail investors should stay away from products like this.""""There's no denying it was painful,"" said Bloomberg's Balchunas. ""But unless there is some kind of manipulation we haven't seen, it doesn't seem like much of a case, because everything was disclosed in the prospectus and the ETN tracked what it was tracking. VIX futures had as good of a day as the ETN had bad. Since you're inverse the futures, you went down as much as they went up.""Another exchange-traded product suffered huge losses on Feb. 5 as well, but managed to stay open.The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) also fell about 90% that day. On Feb. 27, the fund changed from giving the inverse performance to one-half the inverse (-0.5x) of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index falls 1%, the fund should rise approximately 0.5%, before fees. Similarly, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should fall about 0.5%.Its sister fund, the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY), now seeks to give one and one-half times (1.5x) the performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should rise approximately 1.5%.The change was made without notifying shareholders because, as ProShares says on its website, it believed it was in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders to promptly implement this change.

IBD 50 stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points Tuesday, joining fellow chip gear leaders ASML Holding (ASML) and Teradyne (TER).

It will be Jerome Powell's first policy meeting as Fed chairman, with Powell holding a press conference following the 2 p.m. policy announcement.While investors should be cautious about making new purchases with the stock market rally under pressure, one reason to be hopeful is leading stocks setting up and breaking out. And as a practical matter, a stock market uptrend isn't that useful for active investors unless there are quality stocks in buy zones.All five chip stocks cited here have Composite Ratings above 95. Lam Research and Smart Global boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. ASML has a 98 CR, Applied Materials a 97 and Teradyne a 96. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary ratings, including on earnings and other key metrics.

Smart Global vaulted 6.2% to 44.92, moving back above a 43.25 buy point and rising to the top of the 5% chase zone.Facebook has fallen more than 9% already this week, plunging through key support. It's a major component of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Also, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP) also fell at least in part in sympathy. But so far, despite Monday's sell-off in the major averages and Tuesday's tepid bounce, leading stocks haven't suffered too much damage.Not every stock market rally needs semiconductors playing a big role. But the chip sector is a big part of the overall market, especially the Nasdaq. And chips are in virtually every tech product, from smartphones to PCs to servers as well as automobiles and so many other products.

182,L,"The stock market snapped back early Thursday, as it added to Wednesday's dramatic gains. FANG stocks were broadly higher, headlined by Facebook's (FB) 3% advance. Meanwhile, a top homebuilder within the IBD 50 is breaking out in the stock market today.All three major indexes — the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — looked to make three straight up days with solid gains Thursday, as they rebound from their longer-term 200-day moving average lines. The Dow advanced 0.8%, while the tech-heavy composite and the S&P 500 moved up about 0.6% apiece.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Boeing (BA) paced the day's gainers with a more than 2% rise. Shares are nearing their 50-day line — a potential resistance level that investors should watch closely. The stock is forming a new base amid a 16% correction.Among companies reporting earnings, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) declined about 6% after the company's full-year revenue guidance fell short of expectations. Shares had been holding up nicely amid the market correction, but are now falling through the 50-day line in heavy volume in morning trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock moved up about 3% and has been finding support near the 150 price level over the last week, but still remains about 18% off its 52-week high.The other FANGs snapped back as well. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) advanced 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively. The video streaming giant is on pace to regain its 50-day line after Wednesday's dramatic upside reversal.Meanwhile, the e-commerce name remains below its 50-day line after piercing that support level heavy volume last week.Among leading growth stocks, top homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) is breaking out above a 72.10 buy point with a more than 5% advance. Shares are still in the 5% buy range that tops out at 75.71. The stock tried to break out Wednesday, but closed below the entry. A potential weakness is a lagging relative strength line — the blue line inked on every MarketSmith and IBD daily and weekly chart. The RS line should notch a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter. Still, it has been rising rapidly over the last several weeks.On the downside, Micron Technology (MU) dropped almost 3% after UBS initiated coverage on the memory-chip name with a sell rating. UBS set a price target of 35 — a 34% discount to Wednesday's closing price. The stock found much-needed support at its 50-day line Wednesday after an over two-week sell-off.RELATED:McDonald's, Starbucks, Taco Bell Parent Lead 5 Hot Stocks: Investing Action PlanWhen To Sell Stocks: Amazon, Facebook, Boeing Triggered This Key Profit-Taking SignalFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO Leaders

Five notable chip stocks are near buy points: Micron Technology (MU), Texas Instruments (TXN), Broadcom (AVGO), ASML (ASML) and Entegris (ENTG). Micron Technology reports earnings on Wednesday.Micron stock also is the highest rated, with a 98 Composite Rating. Entegris has a 94 Composite Rating, Texas Instruments a 92 CR and ASML a 90 CR. Broadcom stock, which struggled for months amid a failed bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) and weak smartphone demand, has a lowly so-so 69 CR.Chip stocks tend to be a key component of a stock market rally, especially when the Nasdaq composite leads.

Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.8% below fair value. Asian markets generally closed lower in the wake of an escalating U.S.-China trade war. European bourses also retreated.

All the major averages fell modestly Friday as the U.S. and China announced tariffs on each other, with the risk of further escalation.Micron Technology is in a cup base with a high handle buy point of 64.76. Shares soared in May, with the memory chip specialist announcing strong earnings guidance early on May 21 and then a big buyback after the close that day. Shares hit an 18-year high, but failed to close above an entry. Micron stock has pulled back, forming a handle and closing Friday 58.23.Micron fell 0.8% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.Micron is expected to report a 93% EPS gain to $3.12 as sales pop 39% to $7.75 billion for fiscal Q2. The company has benefited from strong demand and high prices for memory chips. Some analysts question if those prices can be sustained, so the results and guidance will closely watched.Texas Instruments stock has been consolidating since late January. The stock has formed an 118.58 handle. The handle isn't visible on a weekly chart, which isn't ideal. But the handle shows up clearly on a daily. It's 7 days long so far with the pullback moderate but clear.Broadcom is working on a 273.95 double-bottom base. The wireless chipmaker has rallied since early May, closing Friday at 270.23. The stock hit resistance around this area a couple of times earlier this year.Broadcom stock has been consolidating since late November. Shares came under pressure as the chipmaker made a big bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Even after President Trump blocked a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal on national security grounds, the stock continued to struggle as Broadcom warned of weak smartphone demand.

191,L,"Let's imagine the following statements were part of a public opinion poll. How many people would agree to these assertions?1. ""We're concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.""2. ""More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories ... stories that just aren't true, without checking facts first.""3. ""Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control 'exactly what people think.' ... This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.""This is precisely what the left-wing media would say about Fox News. But these statements aren't part of a poll. They are part of a script that Sinclair Broadcast Group sent to its stations across America. In a 60- to 75-second second promo, the local anchors in each market read the script, and the Trump-hating media gave birth to a large cow. Clearly, Fox News wasn't the target. They were.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo let's add some more Sinclair copy and wonder why this is offensive to liberals: ""At (name of station), it's our responsibility to pursue and report the truth. We understand truth is neither politically 'left nor right.' Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever. ... But we are human and sometimes our reporting might fall short. If you believe our coverage is unfair please reach out to us ...""The left would certainly embrace factual reporting as ""the foundation of our credibility,"" and yada, yada. What it found offensive is that a new entity not as enlightened as it could profess this belief.What of the second part, about Sinclair inviting criticism from its audience? No wonder the left doesn't like it. Virtually all of them have gotten rid of their ombudsmen. Networks aren't in the habit of offering corrections. Accountability is not their bag.Sinclair has long aired conservative commentary on its local stations, and the liberal media hate that, too. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough shamelessly lectured that it is like the days of Pravda in the Soviet Union: ""A national broadcasting system that is shoving propaganda down local anchors' throats straight from the pen of somebody who's a Trump acolyte,"" he stated hysterically, ""is really, really chilling.""Chilling? This man appears on a national broadcasting system pushing propaganda daily. A network whose motto in former President Obama's years was ""Lean Forward"" (which sounded like former Communist Chairman Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward) and that passes judgment on propaganda is why networks like Sinclair have emerged.On HBO, John Oliver denounced Sinclair anchors as sounding like ""members of a brainwashed cult."" So, exactly how do anchors of news or entertainment shows across the country deliver their reports? Oliver doesn't have a script? The HBO denunciations of a ""brainwashed cult"" are especially hilarious, since it creates Democratic propaganda films like last year's ""fly-on-the-wall"" documentary ""The Final Year"" on Obama's team of supposed foreign-policy geniuses.Now, remember that most of these Sinclair stations are affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC. So liberals object to a 60-second promo — but see nothing wrong with ""60 Minutes"" promoting Trump's alleged porn-star lover or the forthcoming prime-time George Stephanopoulos interview hour with former FBI Director James Comey on these very same stations. One-sided news is the best kind of news for most of the broadcast day ... as long as your ""news"" skews to the left.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:If Finland Is The 'Happiest Country In The World,' Why Is Everyone Coming Here?Trump Dismantles Another Obama 'Achievement' — Just One More To GoDid Facebook Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?

""Cable TV operators will continue to invest, and we expect the (capital expenditure) mix shifts toward network infrastructure and away from set-top boxes, which could enable Casa to grow revenue 17% to 22% in 2018-2019.""The Andover, Mass.-based company, founded in 2003, says it offers a suite of ""software-centric infrastructure solutions that allow cable service providers to deliver voice, video and data services over a single platform at multi-gigabit speeds.""Analysts are singing its praises. That software-focused structure has helped Casa to be ""first to market for most major advances in the cable space in the last 10 years,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in his note initiating coverage of the company.Though Casa shares have been choppy — as they are with many IPOs shortly after going public — they have generally moved higher since hitting the market at 13 on Dec. 15. Case in point: shares hit an intraday high of 24.24 in the middle of last week, slipped a bit with the broad market sell-off and then charged ahead again on Monday. Shares had surged nearly 13% to another intraday high of 25.20 Monday and ended the regular session up 7.1% to 23.50.Charter Communications' (CHTR) Time Warner Cable unit is one of Casa's biggest customers, according to Casa's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its initial public offering. Charter made up 36% of its revenue in the first nine months of 2017.But Casa's reach is global. Thanks to an array of customers that includes Rogers Communications (RCI), Liberty Global (LBTYA), Televisa/IZZI Mexico, Vodafone (VOD) and the privately held firms Mediacom and Jupiter Communications, Casa has a presence in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In 2016, more than 58% of Casa's revenue came from North America, while Latin America brought in 15%, and its Europe, Middle East and Africa segments combined made up slightly more than 14%. Asia-Pacific revenue took up an eighth of the pie.In all, Casa raked in $316.1 million in revenue and $88.7 million in net income in fiscal 2016 — up 16% and 30.5%, respectively, from the prior year — as outlined in its IPO filing. The bulk of overall revenue, more than 88%, came from sales of its broadband products. It derived the rest from services.The company's growth is ""underpinned by a structural shift in cable operators' network infrastructure, and we expect this transition to continue for a number of years,"" Raymond James' Leopold wrote. He rated Casa outperform with a 23 price target.Leopold believes Casa can benefit from the challenges facing cable operators — namely, subscriber demand for faster speeds and on-demand content.Charter Communications' latest earnings report points to possible tailwinds for Casa, says one analyst.""Despite the possibility for (Charter's) 2018 capex to be flat to down, we are encouraged by the trajectory of spending that impacts Casa, specifically scalable infrastructure,"" Stifel's Patrick Newton wrote in a recent note, as he rated the stock a buy. ""We would expect this to outpace growth in other areas.""Shares are climbing, up more than 70% from its IPO price of 13 a share on Dec. 15. That was notably lower than the originally anticipated pricing of 15-17 a share, but it has risen sharply since then.The stock boasts a Relative Strength rating of 96 so far, indicating strong outperformance. But earnings results can, of course, knock a stock off course, and Casa management is set to announce its first quarter of earnings and sales as a publicly traded company after the close Tuesday.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportConsensus is for 32 cents in per-share earnings on revenue of $101 million for the fourth quarter.The company faces some formidable challenges, though. For one, Casa's main competitors are Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Arris International (ARRS), much bigger players. Cisco's cable broadband business is but a ""rounding error,"" according to Stifel's Newton.But Northland Capital Markets analyst Tim Savageaux points out that Casa has managed to capture ""significant share"" of the $2 billion Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) market from both of its main rivals. He estimates that Casa has 23% market share vs. Cisco's 20% and Arris' 50%.Still, analysts see room for growth as Casa ventures into new segments. Its foray into neighboring network transformation markets, and into technologies with names like remote-PHY cable nodes and mobility software ""more than triples"" the company's total addressable market, said William Blair's Ader, adding that he expects new products to ramp up revenue growth through 2019.That said, Casa's move into the wireless market also means it has more rivals, particularly Ericsson (ERIC), Nokia (NOK) and Huawei, which Ader notes have ""deep pockets and substantially more credibility and experience serving wireless customers.""The pursuit of wireless markets is just one part of a multi-pronged growth strategy outlined in Casa's IPO filing. Management also highlighted plans for research investments, selling more products to existing customers, expanding its base and making ""selective acquisitions.""Accumulating capital for possible mergers might be one reason Casa went public, wrote Ader, as it envisions expanding beyond its existing cable customers.""With the industry going through significant and ongoing consolidation, there should be growing opportunities to acquire interesting technology assets that could fit well with Casa's business and broaden its broadband access and aggregation product portfolio,"" he wrote.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Check Out These Tech Plays If You Like Amazon, Bitcoin, NetflixInternet Of Things Driving MEMS GrowthThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleSurprise!

209,L,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model.

Start NowIn the stock market today, industry groups bucking the market sell-off include cosmetics and personal care, long term medical care, educational software, fiber optics telecom and enterprise software, all up 1% or more.Going back to leading China ADRs, TAL is a perfect example of a company that would appear to be impacted far less from U.S. tariffs on select commodities than other compatriot companies. The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

211,L,"Even before President Trump gave his first State of the Union, the left was complaining that he was going to look ""presidential."" It still can't accept that he is president and gets to give presidential speeches. But Trump took that opportunity and fully exploited it.XThe Trump speech was beautiful, at some points even poetic, and delivered well (for him). Maybe it was in the pronouns. Former President Clinton could never stop talking about himself. Former President Obama was worse, once using the first person singular 199 times in a 2014 speech in Austin, Texas.Trump is a narcissist, to be sure. But not on this night. He went Reagan. ""We"" was used an astounding 129 times. Couple that with an extraordinary string of first-year accomplishments and it was a homer both in style and content.Even The New York Times editorial page acknowledged through gritted teeth that Trump was ""right to observe"" that the economy and the stock market look great and ""deserved to take a bow for the degradation of the Islamic State.""But the Democrats sitting in the chamber weren't conceding a thing. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer scowled throughout. Democrats failed to stand and applaud even obvious lines, like the one about record-low African-American unemployment. Rep. Luis Gutierrez even walked out.This was the best-perceived speech in Trump's short political career. A CBS News-YouGov poll found that a whopping 75% approved of the speech, and 43% of Democrats liked it! People watching the speech at home saw the Democrats for who they are: bitter, insulting radicals incapable of being joyful for America.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAn objective press would have reported the above as objective analysis because what we just wrote is indisputable, except to those who would defend bitter radicals filled with such hatred.So when the speech was over, what happened? Nobody in the media focused on the Democrats' refusal to stand or clap, their puckered mouths and their walkouts. All the ""divisive"" demerits were handed out to Trump. On ABC, Cokie Roberts actually blamed Trump for talking about the national anthem: ""There were many African-Americans, members of Congress, there wearing kente cloth -- African cloth. The president never mentioned Africa, never said anything like that, so there was not anything there for them to relate to.""Read that again: African-Americans can't relate to the national anthem or record-low African-American unemployment, only to Africa.On NBC, Chuck Todd declared that Trump failed to be ""conciliatory"" to Democrats on immigration and claimed that the president painted a picture of ""this mythical immigrant criminal here that I want everybody to get fired up about.""NBC also proclaimed that the ""fact-checkers"" would crawl all over Trump's speech, but maybe they should check Todd's facts. Since when is the fact that some immigrants commit crimes ""mythical""?Even almost 24 hours later, ABC merely repeated Democratic statements and refused to question Democrat behavior. Cecilia Vega quoted Pelosi in full screech against Trump: ""'He brings tears to the eyes of the Statue of Liberty and instills fear in the hearts of people who are concerned about the Dreamers.' The White House may have been hoping, David, that speech would unite Congress, but those reviews from the Democrats are in: They are not on board.""Inside the media bubble, the Democrats can do no wrong. Nothing they said around this speech was too extreme. No one questions whether their behavior might turn voters against them.The public sees through this, too. The media are upset their approval ratings are so low and blame Trump. They never seem to take any responsibility and evaluate the craven partisanship of their own ""news.""The public saw a side of Donald Trump it heartily liked. It saw the Democrats in Washington for what they are. It saw the media as an extension of that party.That's three home runs for Donald Trump in one night.RELATED:Dems Vow To Repeal 'Parts' Of GOP Tax Cuts; But Which Ones?Democrats Dig Themselves Into A Hole After Trump's SpeechState Of The Union: Trump Hits It Out Of The ParkClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

212,L,"President Trump's first State of the Union address is a fine occasion to imagine how close we came to a President Hillary Clinton. Imagine if Clinton had actually campaigned in the Midwest instead of Arizona and won the closely contested Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. (Imagine the exact same congressional results.) Then imagine the dramatic difference in tone in our ""news"" media and entertainment elites as she prepared to deliver her first report to the nation.XWhat would we have seen in President Clinton's first year?Tweets by Donald Trump, the loser, saying that the election was ""rigged"" and possibly tipped by international interference through The Clinton Foundation were disparaged as not only unpatriotic but also unhinged and more than a little sexist. CNN was especially aggressive in challenging anyone who questioned the new president's physical or mental fitness. The network sent chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta to Capitol Hill to yell at Republicans and demand they distance themselves from those obnoxious conservatives who cannot concede honorably and abide by the will of the republic.When President Clinton fired FBI Director James Comey for almost preventing her election with his last-minute announcement about her emails, Democrats cheered and Republicans demanded an investigation. The press saw this for what it was: a GOP effort to again thwart the will of the American people. It gave continuous oxygen to the new #moveon effort to expose this agenda while ignoring Republicans' complaints.In turn, Trump fans started the hashtag #Resistance, which the media immediately interpreted as a call for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia and every other natural progression of man that would thoughtlessly be resisted by the far right. Trump supporters angrily respond by showing pictures of Bill and Monica Lewinsky, and Harvey Weinstein and Hillary, and to no avail. Their complaints were ignored.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveConservatives protested the narrow Clinton win by swamping Washington after the inauguration in the largest March for Life on record. But that night on the news, nobody noticed. The three major networks instead spent 10 minutes each celebrating Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards being named secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.The Washington Post created a new front-page motto for the Clinton era: ""Democracy Thrives in Brightness."" Owner Jeff Bezos insisted it underlined the newspaper's ""historic commitment to holding all presidents accountable.""The Washington Times was soundly condemned for reporting that the president called West Virginia a ""s---hole"" in a private budget meeting with Republicans. Journalists denounced the story as unproved, since there was no audiotape, and insisted nothing could get done in a divided Washington if the GOP insisted on leaking private conversations.Republicans reminded the press about all those stories centering on lamps flung by first lady Hillary in the general direction of the POTUS' cranium. The #moveon social-media armies were unleashed to squash this as more fiction from the right.Liberal columnists deplored the ongoing dominance of the Islamic State in Iraq and compared it without shame to the projected spread of the Republican majority in the midterm elections of 2018.It was another tough year for late-night comedians. At the Emmy Awards in September, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert almost came to blows backstage over who was more deserving to get President Clinton's 19th late-night interview. The president had just been hailed as still being the smartest girl in class after winning a game of charades with Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show.""President Clinton won a second Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for a collection of her speeches, including her inaugural address. A delighted duo of Madonna and Cher gratefully accepted on her behalf.One year into the Clinton presidency, the economy would still be stalled; new taxes would be forthcoming to punish the greedy rich; the Islamic State would have the Middle East terrified; North Korea would be lobbing test missiles on the coast of Alaska; energy production would be at a standstill; and thus, the stage would be set to welcome President Clinton's call for the nation to march ""Forward Together.""And how the media would swoon.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Or will the U.S. central bank continue to adopt its steady approach and stick with just a quarter-point jump in both June and September?The futures market, at one point this past week, reflected a greater than 50% chance that the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate by another quarter point in December. That would push the rate to a 2.25%-2.5% range by year's end. But on Friday that probability dipped below 50%. Institutional trading desks focused a little more on U.S.-China trade issues, the powerful rebound in crude oil prices, and what impact a stronger U.S. dollar could have on the global economy.""We're probably in a more balanced position relative to where interest rates have been. They've now normalized short-term rates. QE (quantitative easing) is going away,"" Rich Familetti, president and CIO of New York-based LDI (liability-driven investing) expert Ryan Labs Asset Management, told IBD in an interview. The company also focuses on total return strategies in fixed income. ""It's common to see 100 basis points up or down (in rates) in any one year.""Familetti added he thinks the Fed would ""not risk a policy error"" by acting overly aggressive in raising the cost of money to prevent raging inflation. The reason: pushing rates up too fast increases the risk of putting a hard brake on the economy. But he's watching carefully for those sectors that have used more debt than the value of their assets or are showing cash flows that are not as stable as they may appear.No doubt, in a rising-rate environment, Wall Street has made up its mind about those sectors that normally carry a lot of loans on the balance sheet or may see declining business due to the new shift in the monetary cycle. Just look at the utility sector, which as of Thursday ranked dead last among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables.Homebuilding stocks, meanwhile, still seem to have the flu.Familetti's team looks at debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). IBD's method? See the ratio of long-term debt to shareholders' equity. In general, avoid companies that carry a ratio of more than 100%. That limit fluctuates depending on the industry and other factors.Within the IBD 50 through Thursday, seven companies (14% of the list) had a calculable debt-to-equity ratio topping 100%. The seven firms are Zebra Technology (ZBRA) (261% in 2017), LPL Financial (LPLA), Smart Global (SGH), Integra LifeSciences (IART), Netflix (NFLX), TransUnion (TRU), and PGT Innovations (PGTI). The median D-to-E ratio in IBD 50 firms: 28%.Of course, some firms belong to capital-intensive industries. So if the operating cash is robust, the fundamentals are likely sound. Consider Zebra. The inventory-tracking technology firm posted operating cash flow of $8.57 a share in 2017, above the $7.05 it earned in profits per share. In 2013, Zebra had cash flow of $3.38 a share and EPS of $2.85.You can check the debt-to-equity ratio for any company by seeing the fundamental data block on the weekly chart in MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

218,L,"The stock indexes fell Tuesday after the first congressional testimony of new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell raised new worries that interest rates may climb more than expected.The Nasdaq composite slid 1.2%, the S&P 500 1.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.2%. The Russell 2000 and Dow transports skidded 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively, with the Russell falling below its 50-day moving average. The rate-sensitive Dow utilities average tumbled 1.7%.Volume rose, an indication that institutional investors took Powell's remarks seriously and sold shares in massive quantities. Decliners beat advancers by 3-1 on the NYSE and by 13-5 on the Nasdaq.Although Powell did not voice an urgency to quicken the pace of interest-rate hikes, investors heard a hawkish message that sent bond yields higher and stocks lower.Wall Street's assumption had been that the Fed would stick with a plan for three increases this year of a quarter-point each. But odds for a fourth rate hike rose after Powell's testimony.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 5 basis points to 2.91%, still near a four-year high.The prospect of higher interest rates would normally cause financial stocks to climb. But the sector couldn't fend off sellers. The SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) fell 1%. Part of the sector's weakness was mortgage stocks, which fell about 2% as a group and face a headwind from higher interest rates.Homebuilders and some building-related groups were among Tuesday's weakest.

219,L,"The long-running bankruptcy saga of Energy Future Holdings is coming to a close now that Texas has approved the sale of the company's crown jewel.X The Texas Public Utility Commission authorized Sempra Energy's (SRE) $9.45 billion purchase of Oncor Electric Delivery, the state's largest utility, on Thursday. It was the last major step needed to end the almost four-year-old Energy Future bankruptcy, which rivaled Enron's as the largest ever for an energy company. A bankruptcy court approved Oncor's sale last month.""It's the end of a long and twisting road,"" said Paul Patterson, a utility analyst for Glenrock Associates. ""Sempra was able to prevail over several suitors.""Hit by a collapse in natural gas prices, Energy Future was forced to sell Oncor, one of the most sought-after U.S. utilities, as it worked to restructure almost $50 billion in debt. Sempra beat out Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), NextEra Energy (NEE) and a group backed by Hunt Consolidated, which all tried and failed to buy the utility in recent years. Berkshire took a pretax loss of $837 million on a $2 billion Energy Future debt investment in 2013, and Buffett has called it ""a big mistake,"" saying he wishes he'd never heard of the company.""Sempra Energy is committed to being a good partner for the state and is supportive of Oncor's mission to provide Texans with safe, reliable and affordable electric service,"" said Debra L. Reed, chairwoman, president and CEO of Sempra Energy, who called the approval a ""significant milestone.""PUC Chairman DeAnn Walker thanked Sempra for agreeing to conditions that the agency required for an Oncor sale. Attendees at the meeting in Austin, Texas, broke out in applause as the three-member commission voted to approve the transaction after many failed attempts.""It's so appropriate for a round of applause for all the work that has gone into this,"" Commissioner Brandy Marty Marquez said. ""It's been enormous.""Dallas-based Oncor offers steady, regulated returns in a state with a growing population and the highest electricity sales in the country. Oncor is Texas' largest transmission operator, managing about 134,000 miles (216,000 kilometers) of power lines that deliver electricity to about 10 million customers.Sempra runs power and gas utilities in Southern California, Chile and Peru that together serve more than 32 million consumers, according to the company's website. It also owns and operates almost 2,400 megawatts of renewable energy capacity with partners.""They like Texas,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said of Sempra. ""It's obviously the center of the energy industry.""Before the bankruptcy, Energy Future was the target of the largest-ever leveraged buyout, when it was taken private for $48 billion in 2007 by a group led by KKR & Co. (KKR) and TPG Capital LP.Meanwhile, in commodity markets, West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1% to $60.53 a barrel. Gold dropped 0.4% to $1,320.68 an ounce.

221,L,"The Democrats blinked in the first round of the government-shutdown fight over immigration, but they promise to regroup and fight again for immigrants living in America illegally who came as minors. The Democrats call them ""Dreamers,"" and so, the ""Facts First"" media employ that loaded propaganda term as well.XOne might argue ""Dreamers"" is only a technical term, an acronym for the never-passed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act designed to grant conditional permanent residency to those who immigrated illegally as children. It was first introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin and Orrin Hatch in 2001.It is perfectly reasonable for politicians to plop an appealing title on legislation: the Clean Air Act, the Highway Beautification Act, President Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act. But while both parties do it, there is a key difference. Republicans know theirs will be derided by the press. Democrats know the same media will be their megaphones.For example, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed a short-term spending bill last Friday before the government shutdown, Nancy Cordes of CBS reported, ""He says this hardball strategy is the only way to force GOP leaders to the table before hundreds of thousands of immigrant Dreamers face deportation.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveSometimes they qualify it by saying things like ""so-called Dreamers"" or ""what they call 'Dreamers,'"" which adds at least a fraction of emotional distance. In print, they might add quotation marks.But overall, they don't qualify. It's an emotional investment. Liberal-media outlets already portray immigrants of all ages who are here illegally as a virtuous and deserving category, as better humans than people with, well, ""citizenship privilege."" In fact, when was the last time you heard a journalist use the term ""illegal alien""? Or ""illegal"" anything? But the ""Dreamers"" are even more wonderful.Here's a typical New York Times lede on the subject, from last August: ""Jessica Rojas beat poverty to put herself through engineering college, where she collected accolades for academic achievement. After graduating last year, Ms. Rojas, who grew up in Chicago, was hired by a utility company to help modernize the city's electrical grid.""You won't read in The New York Times, ""Jessica Rojas broke federal law by sneaking into this country illegally.""The media claim to love facts, and they suggest their critics can't handle facts and traffic in phony ""alternative facts."" But they have a way of being very careful in organizing the facts to match their policy preferences. So if the children of those living in the country illegally were to join the vicious Salvadoran gang MS-13, they wouldn't be starring in a New York Times story on ""Dreamers."" Only the valedictorians and electrical engineers represent this group.Liberals claim to love humanity, with hearts that must be two sizes larger than the average American. But not every category of vulnerable humans gets this treatment. Consider the hundreds of thousands of unborn babies who are aborted each year in this country. They are not considered part of humanity. Reporters refer to them using the cold, clinical term ""fetus."" These humans never get a chance to get an engineering degree to gain your sympathy. No journalist calls them ""Dreamers.""Instead, a year ago, The New York Times rolled out an article on the ""Christian"" abortion provider Dr. Willie Parker and allowed him to play philosopher. ""Life is a process, not an event,"" he argued. ""If I thought I was killing a person, I wouldn't do abortions. A fetus is not a person; it's a human entity.""But the Times interviewer, Ana Marie Cox, said in one question that she worries about ""abortion access"" being damaged by ""the sacralization of motherhood,"" and she ended the question by telling Parker, ""you seem pretty cool!"" In the liberal mind, deportation is a tragedy and abortion is ... pretty cool.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

224,L,"The left's brazen double standard on the Stormy Daniels story is apparent to everyone. Suddenly, claims of sexual activity with the president before he became president are relevant. In the years of President Bill Clinton, his critics were told to ""grow up about sex"" because ""libido and leadership are linked."" The public was lectured about Clinton's accusers being liars who were seeking fame and money, ""trash for cash.""Meet porn star Stormy Daniels. First, she was paid $15,000 by a sister publication of In Touch magazine in 2011 to claim that she had sex with Donald Trump (the story wasn't published). Then, she was paid $130,000 in October 2016 to shut up and not claim to have had sex with Donald Trump. History turned to farce when Daniels appeared on ""60 Minutes"" to break her nondisclosure agreement and shamelessly claimed: ""I have no reason to lie. You know, I'm not getting paid to be here.""The 2016 payment to Daniels is an obvious news story. (Any conservative claiming he wouldn't have demanded coverage of a Clinton crony paying off a porn star right before an election would be a liar.) But all this money also creates problems for her credibility. She is currently cashing in with strip-club gigs, and CBS cashed in with boffo ratings. CBS may not have paid for this interview, but both sides walked away with a payoff.Before Trump was president, Daniels could demand six figures in return for her silence. After his election, she realized she could make fortunes more breaking that silence.Liberals think the double standard here is that socially conservative people voted for Trump and now don't care about his sleazy treatment of his wives and children. They somehow missed that many socially conservative people voted for other candidates in the primaries because of his questionable behavior but ultimately supported him rather than accept the alternative.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut put aside the conservative morality for a second. The media's current lamentation that we live in a ""post-truth"" world while they operate by the ""Facts First"" motto did not match the Daniels interview. These same networks refused to publish or air interviews for months when it was Clinton accusers Paula Jones or Juanita Broaddrick; they demanded claims be investigated and confirmed.The ""news"" in this interview was the porn star's claim of being threatened in a parking lot in 2011. Did CBS investigate this until it was confirmed? No. Does she offer any proof? No. Can she even prove that this alleged bully allegedly worked for Trump? No. So why is it on television?Our media also now claim to be solid members of the #MeToo movement, but everyone alive in the Clinton era knows they didn't care about allegations of sexual harassment, or even rape, lodged against Bill Clinton.Then we learned they didn't care about allegations of sexual harassment and assault when lodged against their own people in TV news.It's shameless for ""60 Minutes"" to devote 26 minutes of airtime to a claim of consensual sex with (and alleged threats by) Donald Trump when it hasn't spared a minute since former CBS star Charlie Rose was exposed in November to discuss what he allegedly did to his female employees. And Rose did interviews on ""60 Minutes"" for years.Staunch Trump-backing women appeared on CNN after the big Daniels interview to say this story is ""all part of a media plot to bring down Donald Trump."" That is an incontestable fact. For most journalists, political victory for liberals comes first. Facts do not.

230,L,"Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that came well short of estimates and gave weak profit guidance for this year.X Estimates: Earnings of 88 cents per share, up 2%, on revenue of $15.29 billion, a 3% dip, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales were expected to rise 3%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of 74 cents on revenue of $15.5 billion, with same-store sales up 4.1%.Outlook: Full-year EPS of $5.40 to $5.50, below the consensus of $5.99, with revenue up 4% and same-store sales rising 3.5%.""We achieved comparable sales growth that exceeded our expectations driven by compelling consumer messaging, strong holiday event performance, and our integrated omnichannel customer experiences,"" said Chairman and CEO Robert Niblock in a statement.Stock: Shares tumbled 6.5% to close at 89.59 on the stock market today, hitting a three-month low. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's larger rival, fell 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. When Home Depot beat earnings views last week, management touted its online sales growth and remained upbeat about President Trump's tax cuts and the housing industry despite rising mortgage rates.""The U.S. economy is strong and tax reform is net positive for the housing industry,"" Home Depot CFO Carol Tome said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.""We expect higher job growth, higher income growth, and yes, higher mortgage rates,"" she continued.

232,L,"In another busy week for homebuilder stocks and housing news, LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL) both reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday. But both sold off as builder stocks remain under pressure.XThat comes after government data released Monday showed sales of new homes fell in January to the lowest level since August as borrowing costs rose and winter weather depressed demand.Estimates: Fourth-quarter EPS to rise 39% to $1.40, with revenue jumping 60.8% to $381 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Diluted earnings rose 42% to $1.43 a share.

It sees basic EPS of $6-$7 a share, but that's not comparable to the diluted earnings analysts focus on.  Stock: LGI Homes sank 5.6% to 62.80 on the stock market today. The firm, which focuses on entry-level housing near major metropolitan areas, has a Composite Rating of 91. It is currently ranked first in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group. But LGI, as well as Toll Bros. and many other homebuilders, has been stuck below its 50-day moving average and above its 200-day line.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group had been a mainstay in the top 10 of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, and had a solid start to 2018 after doubling in 2017.Estimates: Fiscal first-quarter EPS up 28.6% to 54 cents per share, with revenue increasing 28% to $1.179 billion.Results: Adjusted earnings swelled 50% to 63 cents.

239,L,"As we approach the first anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration, it is painfully obvious that our ""news"" providers are a highly agitated brigade of the ""Resistance."" A new Media Research Center study finds that from Jan. 20, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2017, the evening news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC were overwhelmingly hostile in both content and tone.XThe study, co-authored by Rich Noyes and Mike Ciandella, comes with a jarring headline: ""2017: The Year the Media Went to War Against a President."" It is indisputable that no president in the history of the republic has been visited by such vitriol from the press. It is not to say that some of the negative coverage hasn't been deserved. But no man this side of Rep. Maxine Waters can defend their overwhelming hostility as fairness.Journalists often talk about President Trump's ""war on the media"" and can't possibly discuss the media's war on President Trump. When the president attacks the media, that's an attack on democracy. When the media undermine the president, that's the full flowering of democracy.Removing the statements made by Trump and other politicians, 90% of evening-news Trump evaluations were negative, and only 10% were positive. (Neutral statements were not counted.) There were only three months in 2017 during which the negative coverage dipped below 90%. For instance, it was 85% negative in December, when Trump succeeded in getting his tax-cut bill passed.The numbers don't tell the whole story. The qualitative measurement is just as awful. Trump news isn't mildly negative, like ""the president's message failed to resonate today."" The network anchors have felt compelled to signal that Trump is so undesirable he should be removed from office. Just over a month into the presidency, then-CBS anchorman Scott Pelley pressured Democrat Leon Panetta, former CIA director and secretary of defense, by saying, ""Is it appropriate to ask whether the president is having difficulty with rationality?""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe Clinton die-hards couldn't stop reporting on their suspicion that the Russians colluded with the Trump campaign to beat Hillary Clinton. The Russia probe was the networks' favorite topic last year, resulting in an astonishing 20 hours and 34 minutes of coverage, or more than one-fifth of all Trump coverage.Nobody rooted for Trump to succeed and pass legislation as they did for former President Barack Obama. In 2009, then-NBC host Matt Lauer badgered Republican Party strategist Karl Rove on the stimulus-package vote. He complained: ""If you add up the House and the Senate, we have what, 219 Republicans? All but three of them voted against ... this plan. ... Two hundred and sixteen Republicans seem to have placed a bet on failure.""That spin didn't happen when House Democrats unanimously voted no on the Trump tax cut. Instead, NBC anchor Lester Holt sounded like a Democratic National Committee press release when he said: ""Unable to repeal and replace Obamacare, Republicans are instead trying to undermine it. Is this a body blow to Obamacare?""To the press, repealing anything Obama installed isn't an ""achievement."" It's a disastrous setback. Some of the repeal happened without much media protest. Trump's attempts to deregulate the economy barely drew 11 minutes of coverage. Trump's approval of new oil pipelines drew just over seven minutes.Oversight on their part? In a way, yes. They have other more pressing matters on their plates.They prefer reporting their Gaffe of the Day. Here's another number that proves the media's aggression: When the Washington Post reported that Trump referred to some immigrants as coming from ""s---hole countries,"" it became an intensely negative news story. CNN was the most intense of all. In the first full day after this story broke, it put decency aside and the word ""s---hole"" was said on air 195 times, according to Newsbusters staff. The cursing also appeared for days on screen.Those screens, in turn, grace airport terminals, doctors' offices and even schools all across America. Millions upon millions of Americans were offended. But for CNN, the effort was worth the insult if it could also damage the president it despises.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

240,L,"Semiconductor industry executives are confident the chip business will continue to see healthy growth in 2018, though not at last year's blistering pace, according to one advisory firm's survey.Lincoln Clark, head of the semiconductor practice at KPMG, said the survey results show ""tempered optimism"" for the industry this year.""It's unlikely we'll see a repeat of 2017's growth rate for global semiconductor revenue, but 2018 should be another successful year in its own right as more than one-quarter of the respondents expect their revenue to grow at least 6%,"" Clark said in a news release Tuesday.The survey also found that semiconductor leaders are more optimistic than they were last year when asked for their outlook on profitability, revenue growth, capital spending, research and development spending, and workforce growth, KPMG said.Growth drivers this year are expected to include cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, or IoT, the firm said.""Though the No. 1 revenue driver remains wireless applications, its importance fell slightly in 2018 though we do anticipate growth as 5G begins to roll out in future periods,"" Clark said.Of the 150 semiconductor industry leaders surveyed, 75% said wireless communications would be an important revenue driver this year. That's down from 84% in last year's survey.Internet of Things was the second most-cited revenue driver this year. IoT spans data devices including the connected home, smart cities and personal wearables. Some 63% of respondents said it would be an important driver in 2018, up from 56% last year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently includes two chip industry players ASML and Nvidia.Cloud computing and AI jumped into the top 10 list of revenue drivers as they were each cited by 43% of respondents, compared with 27% for cloud last year and 18% for AI.Those drivers map with the growth strategies for major chipmakers include Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Spending on semiconductor capital equipment will continue ""at historically high levels,"" KPMG said in its report. Demand drivers for chip-gear capital expenditures include memory chips and cloud platforms, it said.That bodes well for major chip-gear vendors such as ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX).RELATED:Ichor Holdings Upgraded To Strong Buy; Veeco Rallies On Earnings ReportNvidia Cheers Investors; Qualcomm Rejects Sweetened Takeover Bid

243,L,"One thing that defines liberals is their incessant desire to push political messages into every time and space. Their ""compassion"" and ""inclusion"" is perpetually shoved in our faces. That problem has metastasized under President Trump. The urgency of their ""resistance"" is knocking down all the barriers.Don't they know that most Americans don't want politics invading every sphere? Can't they see that audiences of sporting events and awards shows are suffering? They would plead that TV ratings for everything are down because fewer people are buying cable or satellite TV. But now we have evidence that this endless politicization is causing a backlash.In a national poll of 1,000 likely voters by McLaughlin & Associates, 75% of the respondents said they agreed with this statement: ""When I watch live sports or entertainment shows on television, I am trying to get away from politics and do not want to be bombarded with partisan political messages."" Only 17% disagreed. All the intensity was on the Just Say No side: Fifty-two percent answered ""strongly agree"" with the frustration with politics, and only 6% answered ""strongly disagree.""The poll, commissioned by the Media Research Center, also found that they vote with their remotes: Forty-four percent of participants said they're less likely to watch live sports and entertainment shows these days because they have become too political.About half (47%) of the respondents who did not watch the Oscars this year said their reason was political. They chose ""I'm tired of these shows being full of political statements"" or ""I would have watched but knew some of the presenters and winners would use the time to share their political agenda"" as their response.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOscars host Jimmy Kimmel proved that suspicion right in spades. He noted that most of the best-picture nominees didn't have a big box-office number and joked: ""We don't make films like 'Call Me By Your Name' for money. We make them to upset Mike Pence."" He introduced actress Lupita Nyong'o like this: ""She was born in Mexico and raised in Kenya. Let the Tweet storm from the president's toilet begin!""The ""socially conscious"" rapper Common came on stage and blathered, ""Immigrants get the benefits/ We put up monuments for the feminists/ Tell the NRA they in God's way!"" Standing on stage with the rapper as honorees were leftist activists including Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors-Brignac and Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards.It is no coincidence that the audience of the Oscars and the Olympics hit an all-time low. The NFL saw its ratings fall off nearly 10% when a fraction of players refused to stand for the national anthem. No one could imagine the fallout would be this dramatic.Sports leagues like the NFL and liberal sports networks like ESPN have been completely at odds with what their viewers want, and their ratings reflect it. Perhaps they could stare at these poll results and heed this warning before they lose a large chunk of Americans for good.

245,L,"If you haven't had a colonoscopy, you're not missing much, except a chance to save your life.Colon and rectal cancer rates are soaring among young and middle-aged adults. In response to the alarming data, last week the American Cancer Society called for screening beginning at age 45, instead of waiting to 50. And they recommend getting tested even sooner if you have bowel problems. Adults born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer as people born in 1950.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is pushing back on earlier screening and many health insurers are likely to deny covering it. That's a mistake. Some 16,450 patients under age 50 are expected to get a colon or rectal cancer diagnosis in the coming year. A colonoscopy every 10 years reduces the danger of dying from colorectal cancer by 67%.But be careful where you get the procedure.Infection risk from contaminated equipment is a hundred times what the medical community previously thought, according to a Johns Hopkins and McKinsey & Co. investigation in the current issue of the medical journal Gut. An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 patients a year are getting infected from dirty scopes. The scope — a tube with a camera and light on the end — is complicated to clean. Worse, in many health care institutions, the staff get careless.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew research in the American Journal of Infection Control documents technicians cleaning soiled scopes and then handling clean scopes without changing gloves, wiping down scopes with used towels, and turning off reprocessing machines before the cleaning is complete to ""save time.""An ominous 71% of scopes used on a variety of procedures, including colonoscopies, tested positive for bacteria. The bacteria were not killer superbugs, but these findings are a red flag. Since 2013, at least 35 patients have died from superbug infections traced to especially complex, hard to clean scopes called duodenoscopes. Inadequate cleaning is a broader problem — affecting scopes of all types.Infection rates after colonoscopies vary widely from one outpatient center to another and one hospital to another. Before deciding where to have a colonoscopy, you can check with your state health department website or the federal website Hospital Compare, to see safety data for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.Don't let infection risk or the yuck factor of sitting on the toilet for hours emptying your colon before the test dissuade you from getting screened. Colorectal cancer is the second-biggest cancer killer for men, and the third-biggest for women. When diagnosed early, when the cancer is local, it is 90% curable, but patients diagnosed with late-stage disease have only a 14% chance of living five years. That's happening to many young people.Dr. John L. Marshall of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center says he expected his patients would be elderly. ""All of a sudden I have a bunch of young people, young adults, in my clinic with colon cancer.""Why the rising danger? Scientists don't know all the reasons. But obesity is a major factor, according to Massachusetts General Hospital findings unveiled last week. Adult women who gain even just 17 pounds or more after age 18 are more likely to get colon cancer than women who manage to stay close to their teenage weight.One-third of patients diagnosed with it before 35 have a hereditary form of the disease, says Eduardo Vilar-Sanchez of Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. Family history is a good reason to get screened at an early age.Looking ahead, researchers are developing a blood test to identify who has precancerous polyps in their colon, making colonoscopies unnecessary.Meantime, the American Cancer Society and other advocates should push hard for cleanliness in hospitals and outpatient facilities to minimize infection risk from a colonoscopy. Worries about dirty instruments shouldn't scare patients away from getting the test they need to beat colon cancer.Other columns by Betsy McCaugheyMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

247,L,"Semiconductor equipment maker Ichor Holdings (ICHR) received a bullish report from a Wall Street firm on Tuesday as investors continue to debate whether the chip cycle has ebbed.Needham analyst Edwin Mok upgraded Ichor to strong buy from buy and kept his price target of 42. Ichor shares fell 1% to close at 22.99 on the stock market today.Ichor stock sold off after the company reported fourth-quarter results on ""unfounded fear over Ichor's business peaking,"" Mok said. Investor concerns should subside in the coming months, he said.The No. 1 fear investors have is that the semiconductor capital-equipment market is peaking after an extended cycle, Mok said.

250,L,"The major market averages advanced higher midday Monday, extending Friday's solid gains as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to all-time highs in the stock market today.X The Dow Jones industrial average was the clear leader Monday, as it moved up 0.9% after reclaiming its 50-day moving average line Friday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose about 0.6% apiece. The small-cap Russell 2000 was unchanged.Volume was tracking solidly higher on the NYSE, but only slightly higher on the Nasdaq compared to the same time Friday.Within the Dow industrials, Apple (AAPL) continued its recent stretch of gains with another nearly 2% gain Monday. Shares are nearing a new high after triggering a sell signal from a 176.34 flat-base entry in early February.Elsewhere, General Electric (GE) hit a fresh multiyear low with an almost 2% fall. Shares are at levels not seen since October 2011 and are more than 50% off their 52-week high.FANG stocks were outperformers Monday with Netflix (NFLX) leading the way, rising almost 3%. Shares hit a new all-time high and are up more than 40% from a 204.48 flat-base buy point. Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN) advanced more than 1%, also hitting a new high. After falling to its 50-day line Feb. 9, the e-commerce giant has risen in nine of the past 10 sessions to new highs.

251,L,"Market breadth continues to improve as the key indexes showed solid gains on Monday with just two trading sessions remaining in February.X The advance is even more impressive given the negative reaction among a few Chinese companies trading on the NYSE, including New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL), amid news that China's leader, Xi Jinping, may be able to exceed his two-term limit as the country's president.TAL fell more than 5%, yet closed near the top of its intraday range. At 36.81, the stock also is holding mildly above a 36.26 buy point in a choppy late-stage base. TAL has been a monster winner, rising nearly six-fold since it initially broke out of an excellent cup with handle at 6.54 (adjusted for a 6-for-1 stock split) in the week ended Nov. 13, 2015. That base could also be interpreted as a double bottom.New Oriental, down 4% to 92.02, is trading just below a 50-day moving average and may be in the early stages of forming a new base.Plus, leading Chinese internet and e-commerce stocks don't seem to be having a severe reaction overall. Autohome (ATHM), part of IBD Leaderboard, fell more than 2%, but volume was mildly below average.The auto information website is up 28% year-to-date and remains on the north side of its 50-day moving average. Autohome, being a midcap firm with a market value of just under $10 billion, still tends to trade more wildly than, say, any stock on the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq gained 0.9% amid nice rallies by the FAANG stocks, while the S&P 500 matched that gain. Alphabet (GOOGL), which stands a good chance of posting mild double-digit profit growth in both 2018 and 2019, rose 1.1% to 1,141 in light trade and is working on new cup-type base.A cup base must be a minimum of six weeks in length, while a strong cup with handle should never be less than seven weeks.Alphabet is up more than 8% year to date, and its relative strength line (drawn in blue in every IBD chart) reflects outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for more than two weeks. The megacap tech is also up more than 13% (or extended) from an October breakout past a well-formed flat base that showed a 1,006.29 buy point, or a dime above the base's left-side peak set on July 24.The stock market followed through on Valentine's Day, when the Nasdaq ripped 1.9% higher in heavier volume vs. the prior day. That big gain came on day four of a new rally attempt following a nearly 12% correction by the leading market index.Also on Feb. 14, the S&P 500 rallied 1.3% higher as NYSE volume rose, marking a follow-through day of its own.Leading stocks lagged a bit, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained just 0.5%. The exchange traded fund managed by Innovator Capital that tracks stocks in the IBD 50 was up more than 37% in 2017.Top industry groups for the day included solar, computer networking, RV makers, fiber-optic telecom equipment, mortgage services, airlines and movies, all up 2% or more. Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups fell 1% or more, including dairy products, home-furnishings retailers, specialty retailers and auto parts.Another reason why Monday's gain is impressive: U.S. new-home sales for January came in at 593,000 on an annualized rate, badly missing the Econoday estimate of 640,000. Indeed, interest-rate-sensitive names are struggling in 2018 as U.S. government bond prices keep falling, jacking up interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond was around 2.86%, still off its recent peak of 2.95%, but up from 2.40% at the end of last year.Year to date, at least 14 of IBD's 197 industry groups have risen 10% or more. And 11 groups sport an advance of 12% or more. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2779, is up less than 4% since Jan. 1, excluding dividends.Such information is vital for the growth investor. Why?Decades of research by IBD show that as much as half of a great stock market winner's move is influenced by the performance of its broad industry sector and precise industry group. For this reason, IBD ranks every one of the 197 industry groups and subgroups by six-month relative performance each day. See the current list in IBD Data Tables, featured inside IBD Stock Lists.Leisures-Movies and Retail-Internet are up 21% and 20%, respectively, since Jan. 1. You can see the entire list of companies making up each industry group by using MarketSmith, IBD's advanced-level stock screening and historical charting service.The other industry groups leading the market with rallies of 12% or more are desktop software, department stores, mail-order retailing, five software groups (enterprise, gaming, security, financial and education), and automakers.The software sector remains robust. Among the 33 sectors tracked in the market in IBD's unique stock research tables, Software is one of the top-performing tech sectors, at No. 6. The only other tech group in the top 10 for medium- and long-term performance is Internet, at No. 2.Alphabet has a 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup; Weibo (WB) and Grubhub (GRUB) are two of Alphabet's Internet sector mates and both have a 99 Composite on a scale of 1 to 99.The Composite Rating incorporates fundamentals (such as sales growth, earnings growth, ROE and margins), price action, and the quantity and quality of institutional ownership.Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shot up 5% after hours after the innovative developer of enterprise-level security software and systems posted a 54% leap in fiscal second-quarter non-GAAP earnings to 63 cents a share on a 27% jump in total revenue to $542 million, a quarterly high.The results appear to confirm the company's ability to find ways to grow even after it had posted triple-digit EPS gains in almost routine fashion throughout the middle of 2015 through late 2016.The stock, up more than 2% to 169.32 in more than triple average volume, had built a seven week flat base with a 156.95 prime buy point, broke out on Jan. 18, then hit massive market turbulence as distribution days rocked the stock market averages from late January to early February.However, the stock showed bullish reversals and clear clues of institutional buying support near the 50-day moving average on two occasions in February, on the 6th and the 9th, then regained its 156.95 entry point in heavy volume on the same day as the Nasdaq's Feb. 14 follow-through, which signaled it's time to actively update your watch list and buy the best breakouts.IBD tech reporter Reinhardt Krause provides more details on Palo Alto's terrific earnings report in this story.(Please follow Krause and Chung on Twitter at @IBD_RKrause and @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, technology, the economy and financial markets.) Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersRELATED:Who Are The Hottest Growth Stocks Today?

252,L,"Defense contractors hanging tough in the stock market correction are your stocks to watch this week. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and L3 Technologies (LLL) have relative strength lines that are at or near highs. Our spotlight on military contractors comes as President Trump on Friday signed a two-year budget bill that will provide the military an additional $165 billion in defense spending.X It's important to stress that in the current stock market correction, these are names to watch for future set-ups, not to buy right now. Stocks that hold up well during a downturn may form new bases and be among the first to break out in a new market uptrend.But if the technicals begin to falter, investors should drop them from their watch lists.The relative strength line is the blue line on the charts below, separate from price action. The RS line shows a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Measuring a stock's relative strength is helpful when separating strong stocks from weak ones. An RS line at an all-time high is especially positive.Boeing is primarily a civilian aircraft maker, but it's still a major defense contractor as well. Shares have hit some turbulence amid the broad selloff, but the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart is holding somewhat near its recent peak. The RS  line hit a new all-time high on Feb. 7, even though the major indexes reversed to close the session lower.Boeing shares rose 3.3% as the major averages rose more than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With the stock market in a correction, this is not time to start making new buys. But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market. For our latest market analysis, be sure to read The Big Picture.Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor, was able to find support at the 50-day line early this past week. The RS line is holding at a high, even with shares reversing lower for a second trading session.Lockheed shares advanced 1.3%.Military contractors Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have relative strength lines that are continuing to hit new highs as well, and they too were able to find support at the 50-day line this past week.Raytheon and Northrup shares climbed 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, on Monday.L3 Technologies is the only defense contractor stock here that is currently testing support at its 50-day line. With the S&P 500 index rebounding from its 200-day line on Friday, leading a broad stock market bounce, L3 closed the week just above its 50-day.

253,L,"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hosts the Golden Globes, may have provided the rocket fuel for Oprah Winfrey for President in 2020. Her acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award struck the perfect pose for the Hollywood establishment. It has seen itself as the uninterrupted social conscience of America for as long as it has made motion pictures.XThat's ridiculous. The pattern of sexual harassment allegations, and even rape allegations, uncovered by the media should overturn the entire concept of Hollywood lecturing anyone on the morality of any subject.Winfrey drew rave reviews in the press for lauding the press. She said: ""we all know that the press is under siege these days. But we also know that it is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and injustice, to tyrants and victims and secrets and lies.""It's definitely true that The New York Times report on Harvey Weinstein began a great wave of uncovering sexual harassment in Hollywood. But the so-called ""insatiable"" press has been remarkably passive on this sexual-harassment front for decades. Sexual harassment in Hollywood is so prevalent it has its own name: the ""casting couch."" The press knew this; it has known this for decades. Why did it wait until 2017 to say something?Then, Winfrey pulled a rhetorical muscle by hailing the victims, saying, ""speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have."" But the fact that Weinstein and many other men have allegedly abused women with impunity for many years is not a personal truth. If true, it's just the truth. When exposed, the alleged abusers put out statements that say the ugly acts were not ""how they remembered"" those occasions. Must everything in Tinseltown be morally relative? ""Their truth"" is a non sequitur.Winfrey also insisted this sexual harassment is not ""just a story affecting the entertainment industry."" Rather, ""It's one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace."" That's slippery, an attempt to distract and diminish. This lecture should not distract the public from the sordid dishonesty of the Hollywood left, which sees itself as the cultural judge and jury of everyone else.Then the truth came out.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe rapturous reception of Winfrey's remarks was followed on social media by old pictures of her kissing Weinstein ... just as Golden Globes moralist Meryl Streep won the DeMille Award last year and lovingly described Weinstein as ""God"" before everyone knew what she could not help but know.The same Hollywood moralists tweeting out their #MeToo messages have failed to budge on the matter of Roman Polanski, who pled guilty to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl at Jack Nicholson's house in 1977 and skipped out of the country rather than facing justice. Where was Hollywood then? Who lectured Polanski at the awards ceremonies?In fact, in 2003, when Polanski won the Oscar for best director for ""The Pianist,"" a standing ovation ensued for the criminal on the lam ... and among those standing and clapping was that ""moralist"" Streep.In 2009, Polanski was arrested in Switzerland for his crime, and a collection of marquee Hollywood names signed petitions of protest. One of the petition circulators was a powerful man named Harvey Weinstein. Nothing came of the arrest ... except the eruption of another episode of Hollywood's amorality.The tsunami of hype for Winfrey's preaching shouldn't wash away an industry's culpability for the sexual abuse of women -- and even children -- seeking fame and fortune. That reckoning has only just begun.RELATED:Oprah And The Unbearable Lightness Of DemocratsClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

255,L,"If the past few years of the stock market have taught IBD readers anything, one thing is this: You do not have to pick tiny companies or penny stocks to make a bundle on Wall Street.X If you would like to achieve double-digit, even triple-digit returns in the medium and long term, consider using IBD's Big Cap 20 screen as one stepladder to reach that goal.The Big Cap 20 screen is simple. A company must have a minimum market value of $15 billion.Average daily volume must be at least 300,000 shares. The screen also fully embraces the seven principles of IBD's CAN SLIM prescription for savvy stock picking. Big Cap 20 firms tend to show solid increases in earnings and sales (the C component and the A component in CAN SLIM). They tend to lead their industry, not lag it (the L).IBD Survey: What New ETFs Would You Like To See Created?Institutional sponsorship is high-quality and rising (the I), so when the market pulls back and a big-cap leader suddenly cools off, these companies tend to find support at the 10-week or 40-week moving averages. Why? Large funds act as the ""strong hands"" in the market, absorbing shares from those with less conviction, and shore up the stock price.When the market is really poor, you might not see many stocks make the Big Cap 20. Sometimes, the screen is empty.The screen highlights many companies that break out to new highs, rise 10% or 20%, take a break, then build a new base. Rinse and repeat. So having some patience will be necessary. But it also means that multiple buy points, such as those featured in a base on base, will emerge. And in a good market, it will pay off.By having at least a few big cap plays, you cut the risk of a big plunge in your portfolio due to some bad news. You're raising the chances you'll outperform the major equity indexes, giving your portfolio some alpha, as they say in the asset management world.If a breakout sputters, or the market goes into a deep freeze, play good defense. Cut your losses short. That's the golden rule of investing. Get off margin and raise some cash when IBD downgrades the current outlook to ""Uptrend under pressure"" or ""Market in correction.""Nvidia (NVDA) ranked No. 1 within the Big Cap 20 in IBD Weekly at the dawn of 2017 (1). The IBD ratings were spectacular: a 99 Composite, 96 for Earnings Per Share, a 99 Relative Price Strength. At the time, its market value was nearly $72 billion.The innovator in chip sets for hot growth industries including datacenter, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars had already staged a big run after breaking out of a perfect cup with handle on March 16, 2016. So the decline during the first few months of 2017 was not at all surprising.But as the weekly chart of Nvidia shows, the stock limited its sell-off to a four-week decline of 21%. That might sound like a lot, but it's actually mild and reasonable, considering the huge gains it made from the March 2016 breakout at 33.16. Plus, the correction gave the stock plenty of time to cool off, bottom out, then form a solid if slightly unorthodox 13-week cup-type base.In the week ended May 12, 2017, the Santa Clara, Calif., firm blasted 23% higher and broke out past a 121.02 buy point on huge quarterly results (adjusted EPS up 126%, sales up 48%). Volume that week soared to 156 million shares, 110% above its 10-week average (2). The funds were buying with size.A new buy point of 218.77 in a cup without handle emerged in mid-January (3). Through Thursday's close, Nvidia has gained as much as 103%.

256,L,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception. Earnings have soared 22%, 100%, 148%, 46%, 64% and 89%.Now there's a super-easy way to find out which stocks have newly entered the IBD 50.

258,L,"Market-leading education firms TAL Education Group (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) fell sharply down Monday amid political developments in their home country of China.X Meanwhile another Chinese company, Sunlands Online Education Group, has filed for a U.S. listing in an IPO that could raise up to $300 million, according to Chinese news organization Caixin.TAL, which is ranked No. 14 on the IBD 50, fell 5.25% to close at 36.81 on the stock market today, but closing above a 36.26 buy point cleared last week. New Oriental dropped 4.1% to 92.02, diving below its 50-day line. They are two of the top three performing stocks in the Consumer Services-Education group as measured by Composite Rating.Other Chinese education companies also slipped but not as much, with Rise Education (REDU) finishing down 3.4% and Tarena International (TEDU) dipping 0.5%. Among Chinese tech giants, Alibaba (BABA) edged up 0.5%, Weibo (WB) sank 5%, Sina (SINA) lost 2.5%, and Baidu (BIDU) gained 2.2%. TAL and Weibo were in Monday's IBD Stock Spotlight screen.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, the TAL's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a B+, indicating strong institutional demand over the last quarter. However, it was coming out of a later-stage base, having advanced more than 200% in 2017 alone. Later-stage bases are more likely to fail than earlier-stage formations.The falls come as investors keep a wary eye on political developments in economic powerhouse China. The ruling Communist Party put forward a proposal Sunday to remove the constitutional clause that sets the term limit on presidents to two terms in office.It is widely seen as a move to allow President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely. While this could bring short-term benefits by bringing political continuity as the country works toward economic reforms, it also presents major risks in the longer term as it will allow Xi to tighten his grip on power.There is also uncertainty surrounding the administration of the stock market itself, with China's top securities regulator, Liu Shiyu, last week proposing to delay a deadline for the government to authorize a registration-based IPO mechanism until February 2020. The original deadline would expire on Feb. 28 of this year.The country announced plans in 2015 to shift to a U.S.-style registration system for stock-market flotations on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, but the National People's Congress has yet to approve the reform proposal.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. TAL's dip comes despite a sunny outlook overall for the stock. In the most recent quarter — reported Jan. 25 — it saw a 125% earnings boost vs. the year-ago period, while revenue growth came in at 66%. Consensus estimates expect the firm's earnings to grow 14% in fiscal 2018 ending in February and 62% in 2019.The Chinese K-12 after-school tutoring market is expected to grow 15% annually until 2020, which bodes well for the space's leader, TAL Education.And earlier this month the firm signed an agreement with Oxford University Press that aims to bolster teacher training. TAL is to set up the Xueersi English Overseas Academic Research Institute in the English city of Oxford, which will focus on developing teachers' skills and improving learning content.By way of contrast, New Oriental missed fiscal second-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and revenue guidance topped forecasts. The company earned nine cents a share adjusted, up 8%. Revenue rose 37% to $467.2 million. New Oriental was expected to report fiscal Q2 earnings of 11 cents a share, up 37.5%. Revenue is seen rising 34% to $464.05 million. Student enrollments rose 43% to 1.877 million.But the outlook was more positive, with New Oriental seeing current Q3 revenue of $591.1 million to $604.2 million. That's above the current consensus for $580.17 million.Meanwhile, Sunlands Online Education Group, which was founded in 2003, filed for a U.S. listing on Friday. The firm began as a traditional education company before transitioning four years ago to an online-focused business model. It now serves some 550,000 students.""The online education model has transformed the postsecondary and professional education market in China,"" Sunlands said in its IPO prospectus filed on Friday. ""It has made a tremendous number of students aware of the more flexible, cost-effective education solutions provided by online education. We expect that this trend will continue to drive further demand for such services and result in online education providers taking market share away from traditional offline players.""China's private-education programs are on the road to becoming a bigger, more competitive business thanks to a growing population of primary-school-age students and rising disposable income in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Is Trump's National Security Strategy On A Collision Path With Xi's China Vision?Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

262,L,"BlackRock (BLK) isn't satisfied being a titan among asset managers. It seeks to follow Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) strategy, by buying and holding stakes in other companies.X BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is looking to raise more than $10 billion in its first-ever attempt at such direct investments, following a model laid out by Berkshire's Warren Buffett, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. BlackRock has more than $6.29 trillion in global assets under management.The move would come as Berkshire plans for the eventual retirement of investing icon Buffett. Two longtime insiders, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, were appointed to the board last month, with Buffett signaling that one of them may eventually succeed him.Making direct investment would also pit Fink against private-equity giants — including his former company, Blackstone Group (BX). Fink co-founded BlackRock as a unit of Blackstone in 1988 but separated from the firm in 1994, the Journal added.BlackRock's growing iShares ETF business has more than $1.5 trillion in assets under management. While exchange traded funds are traditionally low-cost and index-tracking, they have seen further drops in fees in recent years, compelling firms like BlackRock to attempt to look for new sources of revenue, the Journal said.Against that backdrop, private equity firms and asset managers are seen competing for higher-fee investing products.On the stock market today, shares of BlackRock fell 4.25% to 509.63, tumbling below their 50-day moving average as the stock market sold off sharply Berkshire's class B shares dropped 4.2%, Blackstone lost 0.6%, Carlyle Group (CG) sold off 4.6%, and Apollo Global Management (APO) skidded 5.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess the market's next move.

The vehicle is targeting annual returns in the low to mid teens, and plans to hold its positions for more than 10 years.Potential acquisitions include minority stakes in publicly traded companies, as well as family-owned businesses and spinoffs. Mark Wiseman, a potential successor to Fink, is overseeing the new venture.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Market Repeat Its 2011 Bear Market?How To Spot The Next Major Stock Market Peak: Here Is The Easy WayDow Jones Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Is Not HistoricTime To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAnatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?

268,L,"In the midst of the media feeding frenzy over Michael Wolff's gossipy and fact-mangling book on the Trump White House, another piece of news broke. On Jan. 5, it was announced that the FBI has returned to investigating The Clinton Foundation. Yawn. First, the media ignored it. Then, they touched on it for half a story, after which pundits insisted that there is ""nothing new,"" as if they have access to the factual evidence being sought by the FBI.XDoes the ""nothing new"" response ring a bell? It should.Last year, some reporters stared at the clear evidence of corporate donations to The Clinton Foundation following State Department actions under Hillary Clinton and claimed there was ""no evidence"" of a pay-to-play scheme. Let's explore the depth of the investigations giving them the authority to make such pronouncements.In October 2016, NPR's Joel Rose acknowledged that some donors were awarded meetings with Clinton when she was secretary of state but that ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department."" Rose didn't even bother to look at NPR's own reports. A few months earlier, NPR's Scott Detrow had laid out the 2009 case of the Swiss bank UBS and its problem with the IRS. The tax collectors wanted the identities of Americans with secret bank accounts. Clinton brokered a tentative deal with the bank, and it agreed to turn over a small fraction of the information the IRS sought. Then, presto! The bank's Clinton Foundation donations grew from less than $60,000 to about $600,000 by the end of 2014. It also showered Bill Clinton with $1.5 million for a series of speeches.But there's ""no evidence"" of favors.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Jan. 6, ""CBS This Morning"" brought on Kathleen Kingsbury, deputy editor of The New York Times editorial page. ""I think that given the fact that there doesn't seem to be new evidence on the table, the only conclusion we can come to is that this is a political vendetta brought on by the White House,"" she blustered. ""The FBI looked into these allegations in 2016 and said there wasn't enough evidence to actually bring charges. So, what's new now?""A perfectly Clintonian summary. Hillary would be proud.On ABC, Cokie Roberts seconded that emotion, saying: ""whether they've learned anything new is the real question there. Why would it continue now, when they've already been investigating it for a good long time? So there is certainly at least a whiff of politics here.""On Jan. 7, NBC morning anchor Morgan Radford implied that bad news for the Clintons is ""fake news."" She asked moderator Chuck Todd: ""So break something else down for us, this real versus fake news. We've learned this week about developing investigations into The Clinton Foundation and the author of that controversial dossier, but is this a real investigation, or is that just a political sideshow?""Todd agreed it ""could be a political sideshow."" Whitewater, perjury, pay to play — it's always a ""sideshow.""Journalists would probably excuse their boredom by saying, ""She's not president."" But history strongly suggests they would be just as bored (or twice as hostile) to a Clinton Foundation probe if she had actually won the election. We can just as easily guess that if Donald Trump had narrowly lost the election, the media would still be investigating his alleged Russia collusion.Any voters outside the Clinton bubble who negotiated their way around the ""who cares?"" media in 2016 could clearly see that the Clintons have filled a 50-car train with scandal baggage over the decades. But our ""real news"" reporters live in perpetual denial.RELATED:The Clinton Foundation Scandal ExplainedNow We Know: FBI Ignored Lawbreaking To Exonerate Hillary ClintonAs Investigations Of Misconduct Mount, Can Hillary Clinton Avoid Jail?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

269,L,"The Air Force announced Friday that it's moving forward with Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine and the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano as part of its experiments with light attack planes.X The idea is to test the combat effectiveness of less costly planes in uncontested space. That way, the Pentagon can reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses by sparing them from more routine missions.The Air Force hasn't decided if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022.The decision to narrow down to two aircraft came after the Air Force conducted an experiment with the AT-6, A-29, Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) last summer.In the next experiment, scheduled to run from May to July this summer, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and future interoperability tests on the AT-6 and A-29. But it will take place at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, instead of in a combat zone as initially expected.After the experiment, the Air Force expects to have the information it needs to potentially buy light attack aircraft in a future competition, without conducting a combat demonstration.Textron shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today. Embraer rose 3.1% on news that it may form a commercial jet joint venture with Boeing (BA).IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The AT-6 Wolverine can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and is also capable of carrying out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It's based on the Texan II trainer plane already in use by the Air Force.The A-29 Super Tucano is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The plane can carry munitions from rockets to air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Watch The Aircraft In The Air Force's Light-Attack ExperimentDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

270,L,"Steven Spielberg has made a new movie glorifying the Washington Post and how it rallied against then-President Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War in the Pentagon Papers court fight of 1971. It's simply called ""The Post."" Everyone inside and outside this movie is drawing the comparison between Nixon's difficult relationship with the press and President Donald Trump's.XSpielberg told the Hollywood Reporter: ""The relevance is up to everybody to strike their own balance between the news today and the news then. But obviously, sometimes, bad things happen twice. History is certainly repeating itself.""This movie became more urgent to Spielberg & Co. because Trump surprised the liberal elites and beat Hillary Clinton. The first script for this movie was set to glorify the rise of then-Washington Post owner Katharine Graham as a pioneer for women's power in the nation's capital, a theme that would resonate under the first female president. Meryl Streep said the movie is now relevant because the ""press is under siege"" in the Trump era.Liberal Hollywood naturally sees the liberal media as an ally. No one in the movie business wants to produce a movie that makes the Washington Post or other media outlets look irresponsible. Imagine the movie recounting how in 1981, the Post rushed to print Janet Cooke's utterly preposterous — and Pulitzer Prize-winning — story about an 8-year-old cocaine addict. Imagine a movie about The New York Times letting Jayson Blair invent stories out of whole cloth in 2003. Those newspaper movies will never be made, although they would certainly be based on real events.The media, of course, were guaranteed to gush over this movie that polishes their historical apple. The New York Times played with the Post's new Trump-era motto, titling its review ""In 'The Post,' Democracy Survives the Darkness."" Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine called it ""a superhero movie for real grown-ups."" The Post ""critique"" by Ann Hornaday is headlined ""In 'The Post,"" Streep and Hanks Lead a Stirring Homage to the Pursuit of Truth.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveBut is the media's goal always simply the ""truth""? Or are they motivated by an ideological agenda? Didn't the Post (and pretty much everyone who worked there) want Nixon to lose to Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern, just like they wanted Trump to lose to Clinton?If conservatives ever see this propaganda, what might surprise them is that the film's lead characters chide each other for being too close to power. Graham would rush to spend a weekend at the ranch in Texas with ""Lyndon"" Johnson, and then-Executive Editor Ben Bradlee schmoozed around for plenty of dinners and drinks with ""Jack"" Kennedy. But Spielberg casts these characters as heroic by shunning their past sins of closeness to Democrats ... by undermining Nixon — which only shows they were still doing exactly what the Democrats wanted.Nevertheless, Bob Odenkirk, who plays the leftist Post Assistant Managing Editor Ben Bagdikian, bizarrely claims the movie is ""nonpartisan."" That's perfect in a way. The moviemakers, just like the press, love to pretend they're nonpartisan even as they are doing the most partisan things imaginable.Everyone should embrace the notion that freedom of the press is part of the system of government checks and balances. But what all the media are suggesting about this movie, and about this president, is that no one needs to act as a check or a balance on the press. They can be painted as dangerously ""under siege"" when their bias or errors are questioned. Despite the ""superhero"" treatment at the Cineplex, journalists are not automatically more noble and conscientious than everyone else.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

278,L,"A report that Apple (AAPL) is pulling back on its shift to organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays for smartphones is hitting publicly traded companies involved in making the screens.X Japan's Nikkei reported Monday that lackluster sales of Apple's flagship iPhone X handset ""could result in a delay to the company's plans to introduce OLED screens in other models."" Apple is widely expected to introduce two new OLED model iPhones this fall, along with a large-screen liquid-crystal display, or LCD, iPhone.But disappointing iPhone X sales are leading Apple to consider boosting its production of traditional LCD-screen smartphones, while reducing production goals for OLED-screen iPhones, Nikkei said.Universal Display (OLED), a key supplier of materials and technology for making OLED displays and lighting, has seen its stock tumble in recent weeks amid reports of slowing iPhone X sales. Two major equipment suppliers to OLED manufacturers — Applied Materials (AMAT) and Coherent (COHR) — also have been hit lately.Universal Display shares were down 4.5% to close at 162.80 on the stock market today. Applied Materials lost 3.1% to finish at 55.33, and Coherent was 0.9% lower, near 266.61.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is currently ranked No. 48 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse on Monday reiterated his outperform rating on Universal Display with a price target of 170. Recent news about OLED smartphone demand and production likely will amount to a ""hiccup"" in the long-term transition to OLED displays from LCD, he said in a report to clients.OLED display prices are expected to fall in upcoming quarters as more production comes on line, leading to lower OLED smartphone costs, he said. LG Display (LPL) is among display makers adding OLED panel production this year.Universal Display stock has been hurt by reports that top OLED display supplier Samsung is delaying investment in a new OLED factory, he said. Also weighing on Universal Display are ""fears of Apple shifting (its) display strategy back to LCD after iPhone X disappointment, and news of Chinese handset (manufacturers) focusing on cost-competitive LCD as customers are not willing to eat the additional cost of OLED,"" Muse said.OLED panels should drop to about $70 per panel in the third quarter from about $110 today, with more cost cuts to follow, he said.RELATED:Apple Cutting iPhone X Production In Half After Disappointing Sales: Report

279,L,"In July, MSNBC host and former Rep. Joe Scarborough showily announced on Stephen Colbert's CBS show that he was leaving the Republican Party. No one on the Republican National Committee flew a flag at half-mast. The announcement was at least a decade behind the reality. In 2006, he basically called then-President Bush an idiot. Last week, he did the same to President Trump. There is consistency here from the man who craves attention.XScarborough is the MSNBC equivalent of David Gergen, someone always twiddling his spit-covered finger in the wind and switching his allegiances depending on which option benefits him the most. He announces a new position with a big ""Look at me!"" flourish.Scarborough can boast egotistically just like the president he despises. In a Politico interview with Glenn Thrush in 2016, he actually said: ""when I walk into a Southern Baptist Church -- I can be anywhere in the world, I could be, like, smoking pot when I'm going down, like, the center aisle. It doesn't matter. People still know I'm one of them, instinctively.""In the early days of the Republican primary race, from mid-2015 into the early contests, Scarborough was a Trumper. In January 2016, he proclaimed that the sight of Trump's plane landing in Des Moines, Iowa, ""was like the Pope had landed with the Middle East peace pact to end 3,000 years of war."" In November 2015, he touted Trump's ""gut instinct and strength,"" and in January 2016, he even acted bashful with Hugh Hewitt on the radio and refused to reject Hewitt's suggestion that it would ""make sense"" if he were named Trump's running mate to help win the Florida vote.But soon, Trump would become the second coming of both Hitler and Stalin. By June 2016, Scarborough scalded Trump, saying: ""he had been talking about a Muslim registry. He's even talked in the past about making Muslims carry cards. Sounds a lot like Nazi Germany.""No Muslim registry has materialized, but Scarborough's loathing has continued -- and deepened. On Nov. 30, he claimed, ""people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Dec. 22, the headline on the Washington Post Opinions email sounded like a serious left-wing attack: ""The Stench of Trump's Self-Dealing."" Was it Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren? No, it was Scarborough, who proclaimed that there is a ""stench of self-dealing that engulfs all things Trump."" He added, ""Like autocrats across the world, the 45th American president has perfected the art of the self-deal.""This is hilarious coming from Scarborough. In his pro-Trump phase, he provided cover when Trump refused to release his tax returns, asking, ""Why are Donald Trump's taxes relevant?""On Dec. 29, Scarborough doubled down in the Post, suggesting Trump is guilty of foreign affairs based on ""malignant idiocy"" and transforming into a ""tyrannical president"" with a compliant Republican Congress. Trump even ""used Stalinist barbs to attack the free press,"" proving only that thin-skinned Scarborough cannot discern the difference between assault and mockery.In the same piece, Scarborough quoted the late British Prime Winston Churchill's ""Gathering Storm"" speech. Yes, indeed, but the wicked threat is now Trump: ""The malice of the wicked was reinforced by the weakness of the virtuous.""This man is seemingly blinded by rage. He claimed that ""America's dangerous retreat from the world continues"" while neglecting to mention the crushing of the Islamic State group, or the bombing of a Syrian airfield (which seemed to end what American intelligence reported was President Bashar al-Assad's chemical warfare on his own people), or the approval of arms assistance for Ukraine (so much for being Russian President Putin's plaything).Scarborough shouldn't be attacking Trump or anyone else for basing their political analysis on emotional bluster instead of facts.

280,L,"Wall Street analysts applauded chipmaker Intel (INTC) on Friday for its better-than-expected fourth-quarter results posted late Thursday.Intel received at least nine price target hikes after growing earnings by more than a third from a year ago. Intel also raised its cash dividend by 10% to $1.20 a share on an annual basis.""We applaud the beat and our initial take is that guidance is conservative with the potential for upside,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note to clients. He rates Intel stock as positive and upped his price target to 54 from 48.Others, like KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Michael McConnell, were among the most bullish analysts on Intel following the earnings news. McConnell reiterated his overweight rating on the stock and raised his price target to 60 from 50.Intel shares soared by 10.6% to close at 50.08 on the stock market today.Late Thursday, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, up 37% year over year, on revenue of $17.1 billion, up 4%. Analysts expected 86 cents and $16.3 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Strong data center chip sales drove most of the upside.On a conference call with analysts, Intel executives said they are committed to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data using Intel processors. Intel expects no material impact from patching the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities revealed earlier this month and so far has not seen any impact on underlying demand for its chips.Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the company plans to release chips later this year that incorporate silicon-based changes that protect against those security exploits.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Other semiconductor industry players reporting December-quarter results late Thursday included KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Microsemi (MSCC).Chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor beat expectations for sales and earnings in the December quarter and guided above consensus estimates for the current quarter.KLA-Tencor shares ticked up 0.3% to finish at 113.44.Maxim topped December-quarter views, guided higher for the current quarter and raised its quarterly dividend, sending its shares higher. Maxim benefited from strong growth in industrial and automotive chips and a ramp in production of Samsung's next Galaxy smartphone, analysts said.Maxim stock surged 7.1% to close at 59.01. Maxim received at least six price-target increases from Wall Street analysts post-earnings.Microsemi posted in-line results for the December quarter, but the focus for investors is on whether the company is an acquisition target.Microsemi reported earnings per share of $1.01, up 17% year over year, on sales of $469 million, up 8%, for the December quarter. Its guidance for the March quarter matched analyst estimates.""We expect investors to look past this report, as focus remains squarely on takeout potential,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. He reiterated his positive rating on Microsemi, but upped his price target to 72 from 70.Microsemi shares were up 1.7% to 62.77.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookMaxim Integrated Products Edges Quarterly Views, Stock RisesKLA-Tencor Crushes December-Quarter Sales, Earnings Targets

283,L,"The major indexes cooled off in unison on Monday, taking a well-deserved break after rallying four weeks in a row. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) showed disappointing action with its third significant drop in four sessions — a 2% decline.X The stock, which led the market in 2017 with a stunning turnaround in fundamentals and a 46% advance last year, is now further below its 50-day moving average, which itself is flattening. Failure to rebound quickly back above the medium-term support and resistance line would indicate a serious correction is in store.Meanwhile, some top-notch Chinese ADRs got thrown for a loop. Weibo (WB) sank nearly 3% in heavy turnover after getting penalized by the Chinese government for allowing some of its social media networks to showcase obscene content.China Lodging (HTHT), a longtime member of the IBD 50, fell as much as 17% in the opening minutes of trade in mini-flash-crash fashion before shaving the decline to 4% at 150.41. The hotel chain sharply undercut a 142.90 buy point in a cup without handle but also got buying support near its rising 50-day moving average.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 0.7%. Volume was higher on the NYSE vs. Friday, according to early data, and that likely points to a new distribution day for the 500. Nasdaq turnover came in close to Friday's level.Distribution points to unusually heavy institutional selling in the market. A spate of such distributions can end a bull market. However, as noted in IBD's Big Picture column, the distribution day count on both the 500 and the Nasdaq remains low.The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped 0.5%. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, homebuilders, computer hardware and peripherals, specialty enterprise software, gold mining, oil and gas machinery, coal and construction gear firms fell the most, each losing 2% or more.Following another sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, homebuilders showed signs of heavy profit-taking by institutional players as no fewer than half a dozen names sliced through their 50-day moving averages in recent days. A failure to rebound quickly would mean it's time for individual investors to play smart defense and lock in at least partial profits.Top-rated homebuilders that slid hard below the 50-day line include NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), William Lyon Homes (WLH), D.R. Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHG) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR initiated its strong price run with a big breakout past 1,845.47 on Jan. 25, 2017. Shares went on to double before the recent slide.Going back to Apple, those who bought at the Oct. 27 breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 need to be ready to exit that position to avoid taking a loss or surrendering all of the recent gains. At one point, the iPhone giant rallied 11.9% past that proper entry point. Through Monday's close, that post-breakout gain has been whittled down to 4%.In IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has fallen fast and is now at a D+, indicating net selling by institutions over the past 13 weeks. A rating of C+ or higher on a scale of A to E is ideal, for it implies that overall demand for shares by mutual funds, pension funds, banks, insurers and the like is still positive.Long-term holders, however, can continue to keep watching, even though results from Apple are due Thursday after the close. One reason is that the stock maintains a generous air cushion above its rising long-term 200-day moving average.Two, amid all the headlines centered on iPhone X sales, the reality is that Apple has built an ecosystem that has enabled it to generate strong revenue growth in digital services. According to past IBD reports and statements by CEO Tim Cook, the company looks poised to achieve its goal of doubling its revenue in services by 2020.Three, there is a good chance that the company can maintain its streak of low double-digit revenue growth. The Street sees revenue in the December-ended fiscal first quarter rising 11% to $86.75 billion, then increasing an additional 28%, 24% and 16% in the next three quarters. That's a significant improvement from gains of 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the prior four quarters.Earnings are seen jumping 13% in Q1 to $3.81 a share, then climbing 37%, 32% and 21% vs. year-ago levels in the next three quarters through September 2018.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: Why It's Still Too Early To Buy Back Bitcoin Investment TrustStocks Near A Buy ZoneDo You Know How To Spot Major Stock Market Peaks?

287,L,"Apple (AAPL), one of the true tech forces in an outstanding 2017 for the Nasdaq composite, showed poor action Thursday, closing below the 50-day moving average.X The megacap tech's 1.8% drop to 171.11 came in above-average volume, the second straight heavy-volume decline.The Nasdaq, also hurt by some wild trading in the semiconductor sector, edged less than 0.1% lower but the Dow Jones industrial average, boosted chiefly by its industrial components such as United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), rallied more than 0.5%.The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. Deep declines in homebuilding, airline, chip equipment, RV, automaker and gold mining shares hurt the major U.S. indexes. The Dow transports sold off again, losing 1.6%. At 11,007, the sector index still holds a 3.7% gain since Jan. 1, but that now significantly trails a 7.3% year-to-date rise for the Nasdaq composite.At 2839, the S&P 500 boasts a 6.2% advance since Jan. 1 with four trading sessions left in January.The S&P SmallCap 600 led the day with a 0.4% lift. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq dropped from Wednesday's levels.Within the recreational vehicle industry group, Winnebago Industries (WGO) flashed a defense-type sell signal as shares dropped 4.35 points, or 8%, to 49.The leisure and transport stock play, a nice winner in 2017, slumped even further below the important 50-day moving average in volume that was 178% above the 50-day moving average.The 50-day moving average is an important tool for knowing when to sell and capture solid price gains in leading stocks. Drawn as a red line in IBD's daily charts, it traces the average closing price of a stock or an index over the past 50 trading sessions. Once a new trading day is completed, a new average close is computed and plotted on the chart; thus, the average is ""moving.""Healthy leading stocks hold above their 50-day moving averages. After a strong breakout, a mild pullback to or near the 50-day line (or the 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) for the first or second time offers a follow-on buy opportunity.Winnebago has rallied as much as 57% after breaking out of a long and deep cup with handle at 37.30 on Sept. 6 last year.Notice how Winnebago also gave an early sign of a potential change in character on Jan. 16 as the stock clipped its 50-day line in heavy volume. That was the first close below the mid-term support and resistance level since late August.Going back to Apple, watch to see how the largest company by market cap in the U.S. financial markets finishes for the week.For now, an 11.9% gain for the iPhone and digital services titan from an Oct. 27 breakout past a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 has been whittled down to 6.2%.One of the key sell rules in IBD investing: Don't allow a 10% or more gain in a stock to turn into a complete round trip.Plus, the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts, has been diving over the past five sessions. That's a bad sign, because a falling RS line means a stock is underperforming the S&P 500.The action by Apple, certain chip plays such as Broadcom (AVGO) and other Apple component suppliers, also hints at institutional money rotating a little bit more out of tech and into cyclical and commodity-focused sectors.Broadcom, a humongous winner since the 2009 major market bottom, dropped nearly 4% to 247.25 in steep volume and undercut its long-term 200-day moving average. In doing so, the diversified semiconductor giant also did a round trip of gains following an Oct. 30 breakout past a 259.46 buy point in a nine-week flat base.Broadcom reportedly is a major chip component supplier to Apple.Those with outsize gains in Apple, however, have the luxury to be patient and check whether institutional investors see the recent sell-off as a brand new opportunity to buy shares and shore up the stock. As seen in a weekly chart, Apple is trading only 1% below the 10-week moving average, which moves similarly with the 50-day line on a daily chart.Apple began its impressive run back on Jan. 6, 2017, when it rallied out of a bottoming base pattern. Back then, it formed an excellent cup with handle that presented a proper buy point at 118.12.Since then, Apple's fundamentals have greatly improved, and the company has even posted mild double-digit growth (EPS up 11%, 18% and 24% in the past three quarters, revenue up 12% in fiscal Q4).However, as reported by IBD tech writers, some analysts are concerned about the sales figures of Apple's latest flagship, the iPhone X.For now, the fiscal Q1 EPS estimate has not changed as Wall Street consensus is for earnings to rise 13% to $3.80 a share.Elsewhere, chip equipment leader KLA Tencor (KLAC) dropped nearly 2% to 113.16 after being up as much as 5.9% intraday. The stock's uptrend is still intact, but continued negative reversals in heavy turnover would indicate that some institutions are heavily taking profits.On Dec. 18, KLA bolted past a 110.11 buy point in a base on base, but the ride has been volatile.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, which are ranked by performance among 33 distinct industry sectors, the Chips sector has fallen in the rankings after being in one of the top 3 spots for a long time in 2017. As of Jan. 24, Chips are now ranked No. 10.

Earnings per share fell 17% to 50 cents.

300,L,"The L in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment system stands for Leader. In other words, it highlights a critical factor for choosing good stocks. Always ask yourself: Is the stock a leader or a laggard?X At times, the difference between these two is as stark as day and night.Other times, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. Correctly pinning stocks as leaders — and not laggards — can mean the difference between a good year and a great year.To Google something was first popularized in the early 2000s, well before Google — now Alphabet (GOOGL) — was even public. ""Google"" was even added as a verb to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006 — meaning to perform an internet search via the Google search engine.The debut of Google in August 2004 and its breakout on Sept. 15-16 (1) past a 113.58 buy point (before splits) would lead to one of the first identifiable IPO bases. From there, the stock would appreciate 557% by November 2007.And today the stock is still pursuing new high ground.If the name of a company or one of its key products becomes part of the common vernacular, then it's definitely a company worth watching.Some of the best leading growth stocks in the stock market today have similar associations with their products and services.Netflix (NFLX) popularized ""binge-watching"" in 2013 when the video streamer started to bulk-release episodes of its original content. Since then, shares have surged, rising over 50% in 2017 alone. And they may not be finished yet.On Oct. 5 last year, the stock surged above a 190.05 cup-with-handle entry. On that day, Netflix announced subscription price increases.Analyst firm Bernstein commented that the company's ability to raise prices while growing its membership indicates substantial pricing power.After the close on Oct. 16 last year, Netflix announced mixed Q3 results. Shares fell almost 2%, but they held above the correct buy point.On Monday, Netflix roasted analysts' views on net subscriber growth in the fourth quarter as earnings leapt 173% to 41 cents a share on a 33% pickup in revenue to $3.29 billion.Net margin improved dramatically, rising 290 basis points to 5.6%, the highest in three quarters.Netflix shares now trade 37% above that 190.05 proper entry point.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, the Leisure sector remains a leader, ranked No. 8 among 33 sectors as of Wednesday.Amazon.com (AMZN) has the ""Amazon effect"" — the ongoing disruption and radical transformation of the e-commerce industry. Amazon has its fingers in cloud services, video streaming, and even grocery stores, thanks to the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Next, the company could be heading into health care with the acquisition of a prescription-benefit management company.The longtime Leaderboard member is now extended after rallying past its latest buy point at 1,213.51 in early January.Earlier, Amazon had broken out with a lovely gap-up in price on Oct. 27 near 1,083.

But the overall decline from the base's 1,083.31 peak was a supermild 14%.PayPal (PYPL) laid the foundation for the current phrase ""I'll Venmo you"" — meaning ""send money electronically."" Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases.In October of last year, PayPal shares reached the 20%-25% profit-taking level from a 55.24 flat-base entry, allowing investors to lock in some gains before the earnings results. Yet those with strong conviction in the stock could have decided to hold as PayPal cooled off in November, forming a new base in the process.Notice on a weekly chart how PayPal held firm during sell-offs to the 10-week moving average.On Jan. 9 of this year, PayPal broke out again, this time moving past a 79.48 buy point in a six-week flat base.The mobile payment leader will report its Q4 earnings after the close on Jan. 31.PayPal had cleared an earlier buy point in a much-longer flat-base pattern at 44.62 in late April 2017.Facebook (FB) has its ""Like"" button, with its iconic thumbs-up symbol. In the third quarter, year-over-year earnings and sales growth increased 77% and 47%, respectively. Apparently, the Law of Large Numbers — as a company grows rapidly, it cannot maintain that growth pace indefinitely — doesn't apply to the social media giant just yet. Over the past four years, revenue has grown about 50% year after year.The stock has continued its choppy advance, rising past a flat-base buy point at 175.59 in a breakout on Oct. 17. The buy point can be found by adding a dime to the high on July 27. Facebook's advance has so far reached 8.5%.Facebook is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 31.But making its way into your vocabulary doesn't always make it a sound investment.

(Electro Scientific and Cabot Micro have CRs of 91 and 90, respectively.)Meanwhile, Ichor Holdings and Electro Scientific have offered bullish sales guidance, helping to give the entire group a lift along with ASML.Industry strength is important. Leading stocks are heavily influenced by their industry group, so you want to see positive market and industry trends. The Electronics-Semiconductor Group is rated a so-so 74 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, though that ranking is improving after the chip sector slumped at the end of last year. The chip-gear group soared 7.4%, double the gain of the second-best performing industry.Applied Materials is in a cup base with a buy point of 60.99. Shares closed flat at 57.40 in Friday's stock market trading. But shares still soared 7.4% so far this week, reclaiming their 50-day moving average. Applied Materials' relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has now hit a very short-term high, but is still well off the highs of the left side of the consolidation. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.)Applied Materials and Lam Research got upgrades earlier this week from Susquehanna Financial Group, saying they should benefit from strong demand from the memory chip field. Applied Materials also is a player in equipment for making organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays.Lam Research rose 1% to 207.53 on Friday, capping a 10.1% gain for the week. Lam Research has a 219.80 cup-base buy point. The RS line has topped a very short-term peak, but is still in the lower half of its current consolidation. That's a concern.Lam Research is due to report earnings next Wednesday.Ichor Holdings skyrocketed 6.8% on Thursday after surging nearly 20% on Wednesday, vaulting above its 50-day line. Ichor fell 1.1% to 32.39 on Friday, but still rose 31% for the week.Ichor, which makes fluid delivery subsystems for chipmaking equipment, is approaching a 35.61 buy point. Aggressive investors could have considered buying on Wednesday as Ichor broke a downtrend in heavy volume.Ichor's RS line has sprinted higher this week, but remains well off its old highs.What triggered this stock explosion? Ichor said Wednesday that it expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of $183 million, up 39% vs. a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $180 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Even better, Ichor sees current-quarter revenue of $240 million to $250 million. That would be a 65% gain at the midpoint of $245 million.Ichor, which came public in December 2016, sank 1.4% early Friday.Electro Scientific Industries spiked 19.5% on Thursday to 26.30, rising to 27.65 intraday, just below a 27.82 buy point. The stock edged up 0.5% to 26.44 on Friday, up 32% this week. The RS line, which was at consolidation lows earlier this week, has shot above some short-term highs, but remains well off its late November peak.Thursday's move came after Electro Scientific reported preliminary fiscal third-quarter sales of $106 million to $111 million, a 221% gain at the midpoint. Analysts expected just $85 million.Shares of Cabot Microelectronics, which makes polishing slurries for use in the chipmaking process, didn't sell off as much as many of its peers late last year. The stock is generally finding support at its 50-day moving average. Since bottoming in mid-December, Cabot Micro has rallied, but generally in line with the broader market.Cabot Micro advanced 2.8% to 102.79 on Friday, approaching a 103.02 buy point in a shallow cup base. Cabot Micro popped 4.8% for the week, giving a little boost to its RS line.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Is This Hot Chip Name Ready To Break Out From Early-Stage Base?Chip-Gear Makers Rise On Taiwan Semi Earnings Read-ThroughThese 4 Stocks Broke Out; All Have Amazing Profit Estimates In 2018Looking For The Next Nvidia?

GE's finance arm will pay $15 billion through 2024 to shore up reserves, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may have to prop up GE Capital with cash at some point. Flannery will update investors on the portfolio review in the spring. Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management reportedly is pushing for a GE breakup.

Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target. GM shares fell 2.1%, with Ford plunging 9.3%, below a recent buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) earnings per share and revenue both rose 14%, both meeting views.

While the nation's largest insurer said it plans to use its tax windfall to boost investment, UnitedHealth expects 75% of the benefits of tax cuts to go to the bottom line. It's projecting 2018 EPS of $12.30 to $12.60, a range of 22% to 25% profit growth. Other health insurers rallied to new highs on UnitedHealth's strong report.Airbus (EADSY) had 1,109 orders last year, up 52% from 2016, beating Boeing (BA) for the sixth straight year.

Roche (RHHBY), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which have rival drugs, retreated Tuesday.Atlassian (TEAM) topped fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue estimates.

"
304,L,"Nowhere has sector rotation been more evident than in the chip sector over the past two months. After rotating out of favor in the late November sell-off, signs are emerging that the chip-gear industry group — ranked No. 111 out of 197 groups — may be ready to become a market leader once again. But the industry's top stocks still…
"
305,L,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Thursday morning after the major averages rebounded strongly Wednesday.X Apple (AAPL) moved into buy range for the third time in a month after announcing plans to repatriate nearly all of its ""overseas"" cash to the U.S. But volume was just so-so, Apple's relative strength line remains near recent lows, and iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) generally continue to struggle.Meanwhile, chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML) blasted past a buy point on strong earnings, while collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) moved firmly into a buy zone a day ahead of its quarterly report. Both ASML and Altassian moved in strong volume with encouraging gains in their RS lines, signaling the stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 indexS&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were a fraction above fair value.Apple announced plans to repatriate nearly all its overseas cash to take advantage of tax reform changes. The Dow industrials component will pay $38 billion in taxes, give a $2,500 bonus to employees, and boost its advanced manufacturing investment fund to $5 billion from $1 billion.Shares of Apple erased intraday losses to rally 1.65% to 179.10 in Wednesday's stock market trading, reclaiming a 176.34 flat-base buy point yet again, following one-day moves over that entry on Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. But the same three problems remain that should make investors wary.Volume: Apple's volume rose 12% above normal, which is actually a little better than the prior two moves into a buy zone. But the volume is well below the minimum 40%-50% above-average increase you'd like to see to reflect institutional buying.Relative strength: Apple's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is near the bottom of its recent consolidation, and Thursday's move didn't mark a big shift. Apple's 1.65% gain wasn't that much better than the S&P 500's 0.9%. Apple's RS line hasn't made much headway since May.IPhone ecosystem: If Apple's prospects are so strong, then why aren't iPhone chipmakers also breaking out, or at least making moves toward doing so? Broadcom is stuck below its 50-day moving average, while Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) are below their 50-day and 200-day lines. All three have lagging RS lines.Can Apple's low-volume, lagging-RS move into buy zone work? Sure, but the odds of big gains are lower, while the risks of failure are higher.The Dutch chip gear maker tried to clear a 186.47 cup-base entry on Tuesday, but with the market reversing lower ASML settled for a 3% rise to 186.38. On Wednesday, ASML gapped higher on a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue. Shares blasted past the entry point and traded part of the session in the 5% buy zone before closing up 6.9% to 199.18, slightly extended. Investors should look to see if ASML pulls back into the buy zone or, eventually, to its 50-day moving average for an entry point.ASML roared higher on triple normal volume. The stock's RS line moved above a recent consolidation, providing some confirmation of the bullish price action, while approaching the late-November peak.Another reason to be bullish about ASML: Unlike Apple chipmakers, several chip equipment makers made bullish moves and/or news. Ichor Holdings (ICHR) shot up 20% on strong preliminary revenue figures and bullish sales guidance, skyrocketing back above its 50-day line. After the close, Electro Scientific (ESIO) leapt more than 20% on its own bullish guidance, signaling a move toward a buy point.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) reclaimed a buy point in volume that was so-so: 22% above normal. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose strongly as they build the right side of bases.Even if none of these stocks looks as good as ASML, industry-group moves are important for even leading stocks.Atlassian, like ASML, also tried to break out on Tuesday, but closed below a 53.55 cup-base entry. On Wednesday, shares popped 3.9% to 54.87 in volume that was 69% above normal. The RS line is above a very short-term high and is making progress on reaching the highs of the left side of the consolidation.But Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday evening, with investors expecting a 33% EPS gain to 12 cents. Buying or holding a stock into earnings can be risky.

Shares of ASML jumped nearly 7% to 199.18 after a solid showing Tuesday that saw shares jump 3%. It has quickly become extended from a 186.47 entry.Small-cap Ichor, meanwhile, gapped above the 50-day moving average, soaring 20%, after preannouncing strong preliminary Q4 results and offering up a bullish outlook for Q1.

The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average led the indexes with a 0.6% gain.X The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 followed, rising 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The S&P 500 added 0.2%.Volume rose sharply on both major exchanges in the stock market today. Trade had been somewhat hampered by Christmas, New Year's and the Martin Luther King Jr. holidays.Although the S&P 500 lagged the other indexes midday Tuesday, technical action on the large-cap index improved. The Dec. 29 distribution day fell off the count because of cumulative price gains.A distribution day involves a loss in rising volume in a major index and points to institutional selling. A handful of distribution days in a short period can signal trouble in the stock market. The current rally, though, now has zero distribution days on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. This is a bullish situation for the market.Blue chips were mostly up midday Tuesday. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, about one of every three stocks were up at least 1%.Those rising 1% included six doing so in strong volume. Drugmaker Merck (MRK) jumped 7% in volume more than 600% above average. Boeing (BA) advanced 3% in volume 400% above average. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rose 2.5% in trade 200% above average. IBM (IBM) added 1.3% in volume 65% faster than usual. Caterpillar (CAT) tacked on 1.2% in almost twice its usual volume. Microsoft (MSFT) pushed 1% higher in volume 55% above average.Breakouts midday Tuesday came from a variety of sectors.From the chip equipment group, ASML Holding (ASML) gapped up 4% in volume 185% above average. The stock swept above a 186.47 buy point. A Susquehanna Financial Group analyst reiterated his positive rating on ASML, while upgrading other chip stocks.Netherlands-based ASML will report 2017 results Wednesday. The Street expects earnings to jump 36% to $5.14 a share. The chip equipment group, however, has fallen from No. 5 about two months ago to the middle of the pack among 197 industry groups.China-based internet stock Weibo (WB) gapped up 5% as it cleared a 123.10 buy point; volume was 190% above average. The breakout, though, is late stage, which is more prone to failure.Ladder Capital (LADR), a mortgage-related real estate investment trust, gapped up 7% in volume more than 900% above average. The stock crossed above a 14.10 buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) gapped up 2% in volume 190% above normal. The stock climbed above a 231.87 buy point after the managed health care provider beat fourth-quarter profit expectations with ease. Revenue also beat views.Notice that all the breakouts involved gap-up moves, which is very bullish action.RELATED:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsDow Giant UnitedHealth Hits Buy Zone On Earnings, 2018 OutlookApplied Materials, Lam Research Shares Boosted By UpgradesThe Counterintuitive Move: Buying The Gap UpStock Rally Passes 100-Day Mark: More To Come?

309,L,"The major market averages looked to rebound from Tuesday's heavy volume reversal with modest gains early Wednesday as leading chip stock ASML (ASML) surged higher in the stock market today. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin continued its string of recent heavy declines, falling another 16% to pierce through the $10,000 level, according to Coindesk.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Apple (AAPL) was mostly unchanged despite an analyst downgrade. Longbow Research cut its rating on the iPhonemaker from buy to neutral, citing a ""good, not great iPhone cycle."" Shares have been fighting to regain a 176.34 flat-base buy point.Elsewhere in the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) topped the Street's forecasts, but its trading operations continued to see significant weakness compared to other big banks. Shares dropped over 3% and have been struggling to maintain their momentum since a Nov. 1 breakout above a 247.18 buy saucer-with-handle buy point. The stock found itself back at its 50-day line where it will need to find support.Meanwhile, rival investment bank Bank of America (BAC) announced mixed results, as shares traded 2% lower. The stock remains up more than 20% from a 25.45 cup-shaped base buy point.Leading chip stocks were seeing buying demand early Wednesday after chip-gear maker ASML reported strong Q4 results. Shares jumped 6%, following up on Tuesday's breakout above a 186.47 cup-shaped base buy point. The stock was extended from the entry.Applied Materials (AMAT) advanced 2%, as the stock continues to etch the right side of a potential base. Look for the stock's relative strength to drastically improve; it has been underperforming the general market since late November.FANG stocks Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) saw heavy selling Wednesday, as shares declined 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Amazon remains extended from a 1,213.51 flat-base entry, while Netflix is extended from its own 204.48 flat-base buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell 0.4% after meeting Q4 earnings and sales targets. The brokerage firm has been on a tear recently, hitting the 20%-25% profit-taking level from a 46.31 flat-base entry after a Nov. 21 breakout.Inside the IBD 50, Lam Research (LRCX) jumped nearly 4%, as the stock tries to reclaim its 50-day moving average line.

310,L,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq 100 rebounded strongly Wednesday morning after the major averages suffered a bearish reversal from all-time highs on Tuesday, closing modestly lower.X Chip-equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML) surged before the open on strong earnings and guidance. ASML is one of several leading stocks, including Atlassian (TEAM), Align Technology (ALGN) and Scientific Games (SGMS) that tried to break out Tuesday but closed below buy points.But all four stocks closed higher, giving these stocks a day of outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Separately, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) nearly reached a buy point, closing near the top of its range.Keep in mind that several of these stocks are in late-stage patterns. Atlassian reports earnings on tap Thursday. So is Taiwan Semiconductor.S&P 500 futures rose nearly 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow futures jumped 0.8% against fair value, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6%. Keep in mind that stock futures were even stronger Tuesday, with the major averages booming at the open, before selling off.Dutch chip-equipment giant ASML reported a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter. ASML also hiked its dividend set a new stock buyback program. ASML is the leading maker of hugely expensive lithography machines, which help chipmakers make ever-smaller chips.Shares shot up 6.2% to 197.95 in early Wednesday stock market trading, suggesting a decisive gap-up above a 186.47 cup-base buy point.On Tuesday, ASML also gapped higher, rising to a record 189.38, but shares pulled back to close up about 3% to 186.38. Aggressive investors might have used 184.27 as an alternative entry just above a too-short handle.ASML's relative strength line rose above a short-term high Tuesday, though it is still well below its highs from the left side of the base.The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout by rising to at least short-term highs.Assuming ASML gaps higher in Wednesday's regular session, the RS line should confirm that move with a short-term high and a solid move toward longer-term highs.ASML is important because it's the first chip-equipment maker to report earnings for the latest quarter, really the first company from the broader chip sector to do so.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. Here's how to apply that earnings options strategy with Atlassian.The collaboration software maker surged to 55.25 Tuesday morning, powering above a 53.55 cup-base entry. Shares then reversed sharply, briefly turning negative before closing with a 0.5% gain at 52.82. That was not a good afternoon for Atlassian. Still, the RS line is right at a short-term high and made up some ground vs. record highs from two months ago.Atlassian earnings are expected to rise 33% with revenue up 37%.Align briefly got to 268.17 on Tuesday, moving slightly past a 266.51 cup-base entry. Shares closed up 2.2% at 263.88. The Invisalign braces maker's RS line has been rising sharply in recent weeks, though it's still off its consolidation's peak.Scientific Games, which makes lottery-related products, edged up 0.5% to 54.10 on Tuesday after touching 55.15 intraday, eking past a 55.05 flat-base entry intraday.Taiwan Semi rose 2.5% to 42.23 on Tuesday, approaching a 42.67 buy point from a short cup-with-handle base. However, Taiwan Semi's RS line is still below a short-term high, let alone its late-November base.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Reverse Lower; Why A Pullback Now Seems More LikelyThese 4 Top Tech Stocks Hit Buy Points, But Only This One Held UpNew Highs Reverse Lower; Which Stocks Held Their Gains?False Leader Apple Loses Buy Point, But This iPhone Chip Stock Pops

312,L,"Chip-gear makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) received upgrades from a Wall Street firm on Tuesday, sending their shares higher. Meanwhile, industry peer ASML Holding (ASML) blasted higher on a bullish report published Monday.X Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini upgraded shares of Applied Materials and Lam to positive from neutral. He raised his price target for Applied Materials to 72 from 60 and for Lam to 250 from 200.Applied Materials shares were up 2% to close at 54.50 on the stock market today. Lam shares gained 1% to finish at 190.39.Hosseini said he is incrementally more positive on the semiconductor capital equipment market based on indications for ""stable spending"" through 2020. Applied Materials and Lam are both poised to benefit from continued strength in the memory chip market, he said.End-market demand drivers include enterprise and cloud computing service providers, such as Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN), which continue to build out their infrastructures, he said.Applied Materials also is aided by equipment sales to display manufacturers, such as gear to make next-generation liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, Hosseini said.IBD'S TAKE: Lam Research is currently ranked No. 42 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Hosseini also reiterated his positive rating on ASML, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday.ASML is being driven by a strong product cycle for its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) systems, he said. The Dutch company makes lithography systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.Investment bank Credit Suisse on Monday upgraded ASML to outperform from neutral.ASML climbed 3.1% to end the regular trading session at 186.38. Earlier in the session, it reached an all-time high of 188.49.B.

313,L,"The first year of President Trump stirred the makers of popular culture into a frenzy of resistance. Any list of the year's cultural winners and losers revolves around how the entertainment elites offended Americans in the red states by trying too hard to correct their outdated patriotism and other traditional values.XLoser: the National Football League. Ratings took a dramatic hit, and attendance at games dropped, resulting in thousands of empty stadium seats and, in some cases, half-empty stadiums. Worse, the disdain shows no signs of abetting. The media tried not to draw the conclusion that kneeling for the national anthem to protest the country's incurable racism caused a dramatic counterprotest. The NFL also chose to ignore the obvious. Look where that got it.Winner: pro basketball, hockey and baseball. Somehow, all of these sports managed to avoid a flag-hating controversy, partly because they have owners that won't put up with these insults and partly because they don't have spoiled ingrates for players.Loser: Planned Parenthood. The dead-baby-parts conglomerate that committed about a third of the nation's abortions in 2014 celebrated its 100th anniversary by honoring Hillary Clinton as its champion of the century. Clinton boldly predicted in 2015 that to preserve abortion rights, ""religious beliefs"" would have to change. But the changes aren't going their way: Planned Parenthood closed 32 clinics in 2017.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWinner: ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Liberal panic over Clinton's loss led to Hollywood throwing eight Emmy awards at this drama series on the Hulu live-streaming service. It's based on a radical-feminist novel that imagines America falling under a theocratic Christian dictatorship. All women are deprived of their rights and forbidden from reading, and reproduction is accomplished by baby-bearing servants called ""handmaids."" (Got it?) Liberals gushed over this kooky nightmare as very ""relevant"" and ""timely."" That's how they felt about a Clinton presidency, as well.Winner: Harvey Weinstein's victims. The real-life feminist nightmare emerged from the shadows with abusive Hollywood baron Harvey Weinstein. He has not only allegedly demanded sexual favors from actresses but also apparently blacklisted those who rejected him. According to ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson, Weinstein's underlings warned him that Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino ""were a nightmare to work with"" and that he ""should avoid them at all costs."" Now the truth can be told.Loser: Kathy Griffin. For some reason, Griffin thought it would be funny and profound to pose for a photo with a fake severed head of President Trump. At first, she boasted how her photograph was ""art"" and the outrage would boost her career. Then, CNN's Jake Tapper denounced the stunt on air, and Anderson Cooper disavowed it as ""disgusting"" on Twitter. CNN fired her from her annual New Year's Eve hosting gig with Cooper. Everyone knows how the country would have greeted anyone ""artistically"" holding up a severed head of former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. Griffin would have been the first to denounce it, too.Loser: former Vice President Al Gore. His second eco-panic documentary, ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,"" grossed less than $3.5 million domestically over six weeks, according to Box Office Mojo. What if you were to throw a tantrum and nobody listened?Winner: one of the lamest animation concepts of the new millennium, ""The Emoji Movie."" Despite being annihilated by movie critics, Box Office Mojo says it grossed $86 million in America and another $130 million abroad. As the Roger Ebert website summarized, the movie was ""so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes that movie based on the Angry Birds app seem like a pure artistic statement by comparison."" Ouch.Loser: anyone who liked ""The Emoji Movie""?Winner: beloved reruns. There's still a place for old favorites on TV. In April, ABC's annual showing of ""The Ten Commandments"" reportedly drew 5 million viewers and won the night. In December, the CBS 50th anniversary special celebrating Carol Burnett's show drew 15 million viewers.

316,L,"After a wave of stunning announcements and admissions about the serious alleged sexual misbehavior of Harvey Weinstein and others, observers might wonder whether any of the accusations pouring forward are exaggerated, or even false. Most denials have been strangely and unpersuasively worded, as in ""I don't remember it that way."" On the other hand, some accusations are raising eyebrows.XDoes every charge amount to sexual harassment? Take the case of MSNBC's Chris Matthews. The Daily Caller reported that Matthews paid a $40,000 settlement to an employee back in the 1990s for ""making inappropriate comments and jokes about her while in the company of others."" The Clintons and the Weinsteins dropping their pants and making demands — that's harassment. But if this is the extent of Matthews' guilt, he's a pig, not a harasser.The picture is also muddied by accusers like Addie Zinone, who appeared on NBC's ""Megyn Kelly TODAY"" (aka ""Megyn Kelly's Daily Sexual-Misconduct Accusation Show"") to announce that she had consensual sex with Matt Lauer but now, looking back, finds it to be an ""abuse of power,"" since he was a middle-aged star and she was a lowly 24-year-old production assistant. A memo to Zinone: You were a 24-year-old woman. Act your age. If he's a scoundrel, so are you.Then there's makeup artist Kailey Kaminsky, who accused HGTV star Carter Oosterhouse of badgering her into performing oral sex. She told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I was so worn down from his advances, so I did: that day, on that occasion. It was the first time. Then thereafter it was most every time we would shoot — 10 to 15 times he put me in this position.""For his part, Oosterhouse acknowledged their intimate relationship ... but insisted there was consent and more. He said in his statement to The Hollywood Reporter: ""I would have never done anything that I was not sure was mutually agreeable. The reality is that I knew it was consensual because she initiated it the first time and many of the 15 or so times we had oral sex thereafter."" Kaminsky asserts her job was threatened. She says he once asked her whether she enjoyed her work. When she said yes and that she'd like to advance in her position, he stated he could be helpful if ... you get the point. But if that happened, that was not a threat. It was an offer. And she accepted. She stated, ""I definitely went out of my way to pretend it was something that I was participating in willfully."" We don't buy it.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveSpeaking of makeup artists, Jill Harth filed a sexual harassment suit against Donald Trump in 1997 and renewed her allegations in the fall of 2016. John Solomon at The Hill reports that she repeatedly sent Trump gushing emails during his presidential campaign offering to do his makeup and even testify about how wonderfully he treated women. ""I also want to put it out there that I would be willing to say at a rally or somewhere how DJT helped me with my self-confidence and all positive things about how he is with women to counter any potential negativity that may come out at some point in the campaign,"" she wrote.(We're not watching CNN rushing to the president's defense.)Then there's the old notion of cashing in on allegations. Solomon added that Harth's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, ""eventually started a GoFundMe.com fundraising effort to help Harth and located a donor that paid off Harth's mortgage on her Queens apartment in New York City.""Imagine that.Cases like these underline the need for a line of demarcation. There are levels. There's piggish behavior, immoral sexual activity, harassment. And, finally, there is assault. Women shouldn't be groped and harassed at the office. Businesses from Hollywood to Wall Street shouldn't tolerate powerful officials making sex a condition of career advancement. But it's also unfair for someone to consent to sex and then decide months or years later that it somehow wasn't consensual, destroying a man's career in the process.Most cases aren't as clear-cut as an Al Franken prank photo. Evidence of harassment is often hard to produce, especially years or decades later. That's why cautious investigations and fine distinctions should be made before reputations and careers vanish within a news cycle.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

317,L,"In the wake of a growing pile of sexual misconduct accusations, Sen. Al Franken, Comedian of Minnesota, was pressed by a majority of Senate Democrats to resign. When the number of accusers reached a critical mass, ""They turned on one of their party's most popular figures with stunning swiftness,"" reported the Washington Post.That's a pretty dramatic decline from the heights just nine months ago, when the Post was preparing him for the White House. Its headline then was ""Al Franken May Be the Perfect Senator for the Trump Era — a Deadly Serious Funnyman."" He was ""having a breakout moment as a political star,"" and he ""spent the last eight years proving that he's good enough, smart enough, and doggone it, people like him.""Post reporter Karen Tumulty, the writer of the piece, turned to Franken's close friend Norman Ornstein, who insisted, ""He has that Perry Mason quality."" Except no one ever saw Mason putting his hands over a sleeping woman's breasts.After the Democrats purged Franken, liberal journalists like Andrea Mitchell complained about a ""rush to judgment."" In a discussion with her on MSNBC, Tom Brokaw said political and media institutions ""have to agree to a kind of codification of what is objectionable and how people should be held responsible for it."" He added: ""This is not third-degree murder. This is not a stick-up of some kind in which you can clearly identify a crime. This is a subjective judgment about inappropriate behavior.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThat's correct. Judgment about ethics over the years has been remarkably subjective. No one can say the Senate has no place for men who abuse women. Sen. Ted Kennedy was honored by the media for four decades after leaving Mary Jo Kopechne to drown in his car at Chappaquiddick. In 1989, Mitchell marked the 20-year anniversary of the drowning with a gushing tribute to Teddy winning respect. ""Some call him King of the Hill, with a hand in every big issue,"" she said.All those Democrats and liberal journalists turned around dramatically in 1991 and chose a very different subjective judgment against then-Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas. Anita Hill, his former employee, had no photograph of Thomas grabbing her. She never even claimed that he did. He was accused of talking dirty, and for that alone, Democrats wanted him voted down.XWith the rise of Bill Clinton in 1992, the subjective judgment changed once more. Sexual misbehavior was again acceptable — and victims were not. The media that compared Hill to civil-rights icon Rosa Parks then found Clinton accuser Paula Jones to be a ""Dogpatch Madonna,"" who they claimed pinched men in the rear down at the Red Lobster.Make no mistake: Franken's ouster is in part a Democratic Party maneuver to clean house in the event Judge Roy Moore is elected to the Alabama Senate. The former Franken-promoting Washington Post got the Moore ball rolling with a disturbing article that included Leigh Corfman's claim that Moore initiated sexual contact with her in 1979, when she was 14. She expressed her displeasure at the contact, and he drove her home.This accusation is more serious than Anita Hill's and, as distasteful as it is, much less serious than Juanita Broaddrick's rape charge against President Clinton or Mary Jo Kopechne's death. But the Mitchells and Brokaws grade sex scandals by checking the party label first. If Corfman had accused Clinton with a similar tale, the media elites would have felt sick and dragged their feet, just as they did with Jones and Broaddrick.Don't cry for Al Franken, who is rich and famous and has liberals feeling badly for him, despite all the accusers. Today's situational ethics didn't permit him to stay in the Senate and get the Kennedy treatment.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

318,L,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth. The new orders gauge vaulted to a 15-year high of 69.4, up from a robust 64.0 the prior month.Macy's (M) Nov.-Dec. same-store sales unexpectedly rose 1.1% — the first holiday gain in three years — and J.C.

325,L,"When you're the source for ""breaking news"" but it turns out to be ""faking news,"" you're in trouble.ABC News ""chief investigative correspondent"" Brian Ross reported on retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn's plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by claiming that Flynn is ""prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him, directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.""It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes, the stock market plunged 350 points.It quickly became clear that was flat-out wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what it disingenuously called a ""clarification"" — actually, it said, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election. Not only is that not scandalous but it is also completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, ABC finally found the reporting to be a ""serious error"" and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIt's a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it's verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America — and even the world — any news that could lead to speculation about Trump's impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to overhype anything that could spell ""The End.""This suspension might have been an adequate punishment ... if Ross hadn't already made a long line of whoppers. Conservatives remember the 2012 movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, by James Holmes and how Ross came on in breaking-news mode to announce that there was a ""Jim Holmes"" on a Colorado Tea Party Patriots website ... as if that were a perfect starting point to identifying a mass shooter. It wasn't.But there are more.In 2001, Ross claimed that the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington, D.C., and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Former President George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers the event. He tweeted: ""I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway — and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.""XIn the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported that Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (or ""Chemical Ali""), an Iraqi general, had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced that they had him in custody.In 2006, Ross claimed that Pakistani officials had arrested al-Qaida explosives expert Matiur Rehman, who had an ""official"" list of terrorist recruits and could lead to then-al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani official denounced the report as ""fictitious."" Then-ABC consultant Alexis Debat warned ABC that the report was not true a day after it was initially broadcast.In that same year, Ross breathlessly relayed that the FBI was investigating then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. ""Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation,"" he said. This prompted the Justice Department to deny that there was any federal probe of Hastert, and Hastert demanded a retraction of the statement and threatened to sue ABC.None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who's been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody awards and six George Polk awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors.It's a little bizarre that these days, alleged sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hourlong nightly show on MSNBC, and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against ""fake news"" make it look like fact mangling isn't really a serious offense.

330,L,"A cascade of embarrassing details has poured out over the last few weeks on how special counsel Robert Mueller's staff is a gang of Democratic partisans with a rooting interest in Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mueller deputy Andrew Weissman even attended the doomed election-night Clinton ""victory party"" in New York.Those news items are pouring out from every direction except the ""news"" media.The network anchors can barely mention the fact that senior FBI agent Peter Strzok was removed from Mueller's team months ago for exchanging anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text messages with the woman with whom he was having an affair, who was another FBI official. Or that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr met with ex-British spy Christopher Steele and the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS, which assembled a dossier of unverified dirt on President Trump. They're not outraged that Mueller and Justice Department officials have kept these facts from Congress. Mueller is stonewalling Congress; the media are stonewalling the public.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIt's apparently distasteful to report that among the 15 Mueller lawyers, nine are Democratic donors — several of whom contributed to Clinton's 2016 campaign. Jeannie Rhee donated to Clinton and former President Obama and defended The Clinton Foundation against a racketeering lawsuit. Rhee even represented Clinton personally to prevent the release of her emails. Aaron Zebley represented Justin Cooper, the former Clinton aide who helped set up her private email server and destroyed several of her mobile devices to obstruct investigations.This information isn't disturbing to the ""objective"" media. Reporting it is. CNN host Don Lemon found it ""shocking"" that there has been a ""huge rise in anti-Mueller and FBI rhetoric from right-wing media recently."" This is how CNN greets facts it doesn't like: It says they are merely ""rhetoric"" from ideologues. They run against The Narrative.To see how The Narrative is concocted, see Time magazine's gushing tribute to Mueller in its Person of the Year issue — as if a June cover story titled ""The Lie Detector"" wasn't enough. In the issue, he's called ""A prosecutor known for rigor and rectitude goes after the president's men.""XTime's Massimo Calabresi gushed, ""the special counsel has held the country in his thrall"" with ""rare bipartisan support and a team of veteran cops and prosecutors."" Why, ""There is barely a handful of people in all of America with the reputation and experience to take on the task of untangling a multipronged Russian influence operation."" Mueller is snidely juxtaposed against ""the arrival in our nation's capital of a roguish figure elected on the exhilarating notion that rules are to be flouted.""This is how Democratic hacks write copy. Somehow, the Clintons have never been roguish figures who demonstrated that all the rules in their way would be ignored.On the criticism of Mueller's partisanship and stonewalling, Time says: ""The pressure has hurt the President more than the prosecutor. Mueller is a lifelong registered Republican."" There was no mention in its ridiculous puff piece of any Democratic partisanship on Mueller's staff. None at all.For contrast, recall Time's Men of the Year issue at the end of 1998. Back then, anti-Kenneth Starr commentary wasn't ""shocking."" It was mandatory. Time insisted Starr had engaged in a witch hunt and ""disastrously"" included stark sexual details in the Starr Report. The magazine responded to Clinton's impeachment with moral equivalence, saying: ""The more Starr pushed, the more Clinton stalled. And in the end, each drove the other to a kind of madness."" Time concluded that ""like Bill Clinton, he still dreams of being found not guilty.""But Time now insists Mueller is ""the personification of the idea that rule of law remains paramount."" There's a reason these ""news"" magazines have crumbled: They are only trustworthy if what you want to read is a Democratic National Committee talking-points memo.RELATED:The Trump-Russia 'Dossier' Scandal DeepensFBI, Mueller Investigation Of Trump Is Politicized — Shut It DownDid A Corrupt FBI Give Hillary Clinton A Free Pass?

Growth was also up sharply from Saturday and Sunday, which brought in a total of $5.12 billion online, up 10.1%.So which stores are racking up major sales, and which ones are desperate for shoppers?Toys and gadgets were predictably hot on Black Friday: the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles, PJ Masks, L.O.L. Surprise Dolls, Ride On Cars, and Google (GOOGL) Chromecast and Roku (ROKU) streaming devices were top sellers, said Adobe.Computers, TVs and toys were the most discounted products on Friday, and shoppers looking to complete their holiday shopping will likely find great deals on toys again today, as toys are expected to get the biggest price cuts on Cyber Monday. Piper Jaffray said Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) was the busiest store its analysts visited in both Minnesota and Texas over the weekend.""Overall, we think (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before (Black Friday),"" wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""However, given the cold spurt in early November we believe outerwear was a big purchase early on which left room for apparel purchases over BF, particularly given the new fashion cycle.""At the mall, American Eagle (AEO) (and its Aerie brand), Build-A-Bear Workshop, L Brands' (LB) Pink and Gap (GPS) chain Old Navy came out on top on Black Friday, she said, ""managing sales/promos that should lead to good top lines and bottom lines.""Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Abercrombie-owned Hollister also merited callouts from Anderson, although traffic at both stores was lower than that of the top performers. The firm's analysts spotted mall visitors toting Victoria's Secret, Build-A-Bear, American Eagle, Macy's (M), Forever 21 and Lululemon (LULU) bags more than any others.""Fashion apparel looked to be the key items over TG/BF, while activewear continued to be challenged and even though athletic footwear appeared strong it was mainly driven by discounts,"" wrote Anderson.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Struggling Under Armour (UAA) offered 50% discounts at its factory outlets, noted analysts, a contrast to Nike's (NKE) 25%-off promotion at outlet stores and Adidas' (ADDYY) more-modest promotions.But even as shoppers hit the registers this past weekend, the American mall continues to suffer. Brick-and-mortar traffic fell over 7.5% on Black Friday, and same-store retail traffic fell over 3%, according to Cowen, citing national traffic devices.

347,L,"The privileged and prestigious professional life of Charlie Rose came to a shocking end this week. In the latest lurid front-page testimony on powerful men, the Washington Post reported that eight women have accused Rose of brutish and exhibitionist behavior. They said new employees were sometimes rubbed on the shoulders by his ""crusty paw,"" and that he liked walking out naked in front of female staffers. Boom. CBS and PBS abruptly fired him.This was shocking to people who watched Rose glide along with elites. He seemed to be a courtly Southern gentleman on air. But that turned out to be deeply false. His ego was immense, while his humble, facilitating TV persona seemed the polar opposite of an aggressive questioner like his late ""60 Minutes"" colleague Mike Wallace.Did Rose see his day of reckoning drawing nearer in the wake of the Donald Trump ""Access Hollywood"" tape and the Harvey Weinstein wave? You couldn't tell from his interviews. He asked former magazine editor Tina Brown about Weinstein's rapacious ways and sympathized with Amy Schumer's tale of sexual assault. He let New York Times columnist David Brooks blame the hostile environment on the bubble of impunity surrounding former President Bill Clinton. He scolded Steve Bannon about President Trump's ""locker-room talk"" with Billy Bush.Rose even let ""Full Frontal"" host Samantha Bee use him for a satirical skit for TBS last summer titled ""What Are You Hiding, Charlie Rose?"" The two were in his studio with the typical black backdrop, and when Bee turned on the lights, creepy clones of Rose were revealed to be hiding in the darkness. Her face was horrified as one clone pawed her shoulder.Perhaps like so many others of the ruling elite, Rose believed he was untouchable. (Apparently, lots of people thought that!) Rose must have believed that anyone he had wronged would never come forward. Even when they did, he insisted there was no ""wrongdoing."" Like many self-absorbed lechers caught up in this, well, ""malestrom,"" he sounded clueless about his behavior. He put out a statement that included this sentence about his aggressive advances: ""I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though now I realize I was mistaken.""XThe idea of a 75-year-old man strolling around naked in front of a college-age assistant like he is grade A material is the definition of delusion. He's just a dirty old man. It sounds like someone who always believed the old Henry Kissinger axiom ""Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac,"" or in his case, that sitting and listening to the powerful and stroking their egos on public TV made him irresistible.It was a slightly gentler echo of the comedian Louis C.K., who caused unintentional laughter by admitting, ""At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay, because I never showed a woman my d--- without asking first."" He had to be taught that disrobing and masturbating in front of women he'd just met was for them a ""predicament.""Every powerful man who is getting caught up in this wave isn't living by the Ten Commandments but by the ""Access Hollywood"" code: When you're a star, the women will let you do it. You can do anything.Charlie Rose exploited women for decades as he produced shows at Bloomberg's TV studio for PBS and hosted shows on CBS. None of those news agencies ever seemed to find any wrongdoing inside their own offices worth reporting. The embarrassment and shame should also be theirs.RELATED:Hollywood Moralists Exposed As HypocritesFLASHBACK: Obama Admin Protected Sex Offender, Helping Re-electionHollywood Harassment Scandal Now Envelops Amazon And TwitterClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

350,L,"On Nov. 9, Rolling Stone magazine celebrated the 50th anniversary of its first issue, published in the hippie Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco. True to form, liberal journalists — who claim to care so deeply about the menace of fake reporting — honored founder Jann Wenner and dismissed as insignificant the magazine's 2015 ""A Rape on Campus"" story scandal.On Nov. 5, CBS ""Sunday Morning"" host Jane Pauley gushed over Wenner as ""the rock star of publishing."" Minutes later, she upgraded the flattery by calling him ""perhaps the most influential rock star on the planet.""Out of nearly nine minutes, CBS correspondent Anthony Mason spent less than a minute on the fake story about gang rape at the University of Virginia. He asked, ""How much did UVA hurt the magazine?"" Wenner replied, ""a little."" Mason pushed back, and Wenner complained that it was ""one incident"" in 50 years, saying: ""I think that the people who were in charge of this at the time, you know, let certain standards slide. Were it not for this one woman who fabricated, that was golden; that was a great story."" Had both the interviewer and interviewee yawned at this point, it would have done justice to the mood.""This one woman"" was the center of the story, which became a national outrage about gang-raping fraternity boys. It turns out Rolling Stone didn't even get to square one and attempt to verify that there was a party at the Phi Kappa Psi frat house on the night in question. There wasn't. That's why it had to fork over $1.65 million in damages.Put yourself in the shoes of those innocent young men who were accused of such a heinous crime, found guilty by such a powerful magazine and soundly condemned by a nation. The $1.65 million in damages does not begin to erase the humiliation.XNBC's ""Today"" show interviewed Wenner and didn't even bring up the subject. Host Matt Lauer was more interested in asking, ""what are you most proud of in terms of a social issue that you got ahead of?"" How about rape on campus? At least Lauer asked about the Rolling Stone cover that glamorized Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and then asked: ""Was that your biggest do-over? Or are there some others?"" Wenner volunteered the UVA story, saying, ""we got, you know, really duped."" So it just wasn't the magazine's fault. How's that for taking responsibility?ABC's ""Good Morning America"" aired a story on Rolling Stone and a new Wenner biography on Oct. 20, which didn't include a word about the fake rape story as the host gushed over a 1972 nude cover photo of ""Partridge Family"" star David Cassidy.Despite being exposed as an unreliable source of lies and character assassination, almost every liberal-media notice started with comparing Rolling Stone to the Holy Bible. This suggests that they're all eager lackeys of the hippie magazine's public relations staff. CBS began, saying, ""It's been the cultural bible of baby boomers for half a century."" NBC also called it ""the cultural bible for baby boomers."" The New York Times described it as the ""shiny entertainment-industry bible."" A few weeks ago, a Times headline read, ""Rolling Stone, Once a Counterculture Bible, Will Be Put Up for Sale.""If Rolling Stone represents the ""sacred text"" of the 60s-mythologizing left, then that's a sad indictment. But it's obvious that the magazine was part of transforming the ""counterculture"" into the ""culture."" Its revered status as a cultural ""agent of change"" seems to be a major reason why the media elites grant the magazine a pass on smearing entire universities.And with that, let's return to those media lectures about the need for honest and competent journalism.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

358,L,"A Morning Consult poll released on Halloween offers a scary result for establishment Republicans. They tested the approval and disapproval ratings of current members of the U.S. Senate. Guess who was in the cellar. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ranked dead last.Guess who came in second to last. It was Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator who's retiring because he wouldn't possibly be able to win a Republican primary next year. Guess who came in third to last. Sen. John McCain.Now take a look at who has the highest approval. Sen. Bernie Sanders came in first, with 71% approval. Right behind him, with 67%, was his fellow leftist from Vermont, Patrick Leahy.What lesson can we take from this particular survey? It starts with the media elites. When the media love a leftist, that only helps them with their base. ""The friend of my friend is my friend,"" as it were. It also endears them to independents, since the media portray leftists as feisty populists for the common man, not as the over-regulating, super-taxing socialists they are.On the other hand, when the media love a Republican, that causes great problems with the Republican's conservative base. It's ""The friend of my enemy is my enemy."" It's one obvious reason why McCain, despite (or, more accurately, because of) media valentines, couldn't defeat President George W. Bush in the 2000 primaries.Trump voters cannot stand McCain's personal crusade against Trump. The media desperately want Republicans to attack Trump as viciously as they do, but getting on the wrong side of Trump is a perilous place to be.Sen. Flake's speech on the Senate floor announcing the inevitable — that running for re-election would be fruitless — made him the toast of MSNBC. Joe Scarborough gushed, ""This was our 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' where you had a senator saying on the floor that the president of the United States in his party was a threat to constitutional norms, societal norms and our children."" Predictably, Chris Matthews also dragged out the Jimmy Stewart movie reference, comparing Flake's speech to ""a moment straight from a great novel or movie.""When a Republican is the toast of MSNBC, he's toast with conservatives.Let's stipulate that McConnell isn't a media darling like the two Arizonans. It's easy to recall how the journalists who want Trump impeached/indicted had a conniption when McConnell said out loud in 2010 that his first goal was to deny Obama re-election. They reacted like he'd slapped the pope in the face while kicking Santa Claus in the groin. But to both right and left, McConnell represents Entrenched Washington, and right now, he embodies the disgust conservatives feel for having many of their policy aims sidelined and/or squashed.Not every senator fits the formula. The fourth least popular senator is Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who's now on trial for felony corruption charges. Of note: His rotten approval rating cannot be connected to national media coverage, since he is a Democrat. Forget accusations against Trump, or indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. We are talking about a trial in which the defense has now rested. And the evening-news coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC? Zero.Corruption, in the eyes of our partisan media, is solely a Trump problem, just like colluding with Russia to manipulate the election, or hating facts you find inconvenient. When Republicans agreeably proclaim that only Trump is ruining Washington on all of these things, they are trapped in the liberal-media mind meld.

359,L,"On Oct. 24, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee hired the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. The firm then retained former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele, who assembled a dubious dossier (complete with rumors of encounters with prostitutes) with information from his Russian contacts.Breaking news? Hardly. It has all but disappeared.This should have seriously undermined months of wildly speculative reporting on the Trump campaign seeking dirt on Clinton from the Russians, as well as the Democrats' warning of ""treason."" Even with the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, there's still not a scintilla of evidence of Russia-Trump collusion. But looking like hypocrites for deeply indulging in a double standard never slows these ""news"" reporters down.The Daily Caller hints at a deeper angle, and it calls into question the media's sermons on transparency. CNN justice correspondent Evan Perez hyped the dossier, but Perez and CNN never told viewers that Perez worked closely with the founders of Fusion GPS for years at a previous job.Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS co-founder ""most often associated with the dossier,"" worked on the same reporting staff as Perez at The Wall Street Journal, and they regularly co-authored stories.Peter Fritsch, another Fusion co-founder, worked above Simpson and Perez as the Journal's senior national security editor.A third co-founder, Tom Catan, was also a Wall Street Journal reporter in the same time frame. The Daily Caller showed Facebook photos of these men still going to baseball games and taking fishing vacations together.CNN's anti-Trump stories have hidden all this behind a wall of ""anonymous sources."" This is one dreadfully serious reason why the American people don't trust investigative reporting: In reality, it looks like a series of chummy handoffs funded by Trump opponents.""Pro-Clinton political activism"" and ""news reporting"" are one and the same. ""News"" is being assembled and colored by personal transactions between old friends and/or political allies. There's a lot of horse trading and glad-handing in the ""news"" process that they hide through their opaque sourcing techniques.To be fair and balanced on this ethical front, the conservative Washington Free Beacon website also retained Fusion GPS for research — for a few months before the Clinton campaign and the DNC — and The Daily Caller says it had reported on Fusion GPS without acknowledging a relationship.For decades now, campaigns have been ravenous for opposition research — combing over decades of a candidate's policy positions, speeches and personal behavior; looking for something damaging that could change a political trajectory. Candidates and political parties pay for it, but the investigative reporters are also doing it.In the Trump era, ""reporting"" and ""opposition research"" have become one and the same. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid former reporters to find a gold mine in Russia. Why go to the expense? Hundreds of liberal reporters have helped the Democrats at no charge. The public needs to be skeptical about just how ethical they are in organizing scoops behind the scenes.RELATED:Mueller's Indictment Of Manafort: Desperate Prosecutorial Hail Mary, Or Trap For Trump?Who's Actually Guilty Of Colluding With Putin — Trump Or The Democrats?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

365,L,"In their book ""Shattered,"" Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes report that within 24 hours of losing the presidential election, Hillary Clinton was ordering her campaign to argue that it was hacked by Russia. Just as reporters leaped to find ""news"" to corroborate her allegations of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" (VRWC for short) during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, they have lunged at stories of Russian interference to validate VRWC 2.0.Second verse, same as the first. The media outlets most deeply invested in the narrative about Russia having somehow masterfully manipulated the 2016 election are beginning to struggle as the actual facts tumble out. Getting a closer look at the Russia Facebook postings doesn't help the Sore Loser Chorus. In fact, it demolishes it.The New York Times posted a story on Oct. 9 headlined ""How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape U.S. Politics."" But there in the details was a dramatic shapelessness, a borrowing from the left and the right, that ultimately underscored why the story should have never been published in the first place.Times reporters Nicholas Confessore and Daisuke Wakabayashi explained that one Russian Facebook page was called ""the United Muslims of America,"" which often shared posts and videos about American Islamophobia. It stole a YouTube video produced by a man named Waqas Shah in which actors he'd paid shoved him around in New York City to see whether bystanders would object. They did not. So America is bigoted.But another Russian account called ""Being Patriotic"" spread a widely circulated internet hoax about how Muslim men in Michigan were collecting welfare payments for multiple wives. So the Russians were both protesting Islamophobia ... and promoting it. How is that ""reshaping"" our election process? It is what it is: an attempt to inflame both ends of the spectrum and set them to war against each other.If the Times is trying to corroborate Clinton's Russia-Trump conspiracy, it is not helping itself when it reports in the same piece that the Russians caused Americans on both sides of the divide to promote their material. It noted that a Facebook page called ""Blacktivist"" carried ""passionate denunciations of the criminal justice system and viral videos of police violence."" One of the posts about the death of a black teenager in a fight with police in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was reposted by Black Lives Matter Chicago.The Being Patriotic page also stirred up conservatives with a message against more refugee settlements in America. But here's the glaring difference in coverage: The Times asked conservative social-media activists how they felt about having been used by the Russians, but they didn't get any quotes from Black Lives Matter about having been manipulated.Washington Examiner correspondent Byron York dealt a major blow to these Russia-Trump conspiracy theories by reporting facts that Facebook itself has revealed.Nothing the Clintonistas have cited as the ""real killers"" of her presidential hopes has turned out to be true. Clinton wanted Donald Trump as her opponent. Then she couldn't vanquish him. And now she can't face it.RELATED:Is Any Part Of The Russia Election Hacking Story True?Now Hillary Wants To Challenge The Election?

369,L,"The swift revolution against sexual harassment is ending the careers of a series of media ""icons,"" left and right. But perhaps nowhere is this hypocrisy more notable (and deeper) than at PBS and NPR. These were the entities that made sexual harassment the boiling feminist issue when Anita Hill testified during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing in 1991.Here's an easy question: Why didn't this sudden spirit of self-discovery and investigation happen back then? Or in any year since? It could have happened when then-President Bill Clinton settled with Paula Jones in 1998, or even last year as these networks enjoyed reporting on sexual harassment scandals inside Fox News. All along the way, it appears that very same sexual harassment was alive at both PBS and NPR.And mum was the word.In case you missed the trend — and with all the other scandals breaking, who could blame you? — on Nov. 1, NPR first forced out its vice president of news, Michael Oreskes, following accusations of sexual harassment during his tenure at NPR and The New York Times. Soon after he stepped down, five complaints were filed by women of NPR. On Nov. 3, The Washington Post said that ""NPR's employees unleashed their fury"" at CEO Jarl Mohn ""over his handling of a sexual harassment scandal that appears to have spread."" A few days later, Mohn took a medical leave.The TV folks at PBS followed on Nov. 21, when they abruptly ended its broadcasts of longtime talk-show host Charlie Rose.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Nov. 29, NPR followed that by firing Chief News Editor David Sweeney, who'd been at the taxpayer-subsidized radio network since 1993, for allegedly harassing subordinates.That same day, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with star Garrison Keillor of ""A Prairie Home Companion"" for alleged sexual misconduct. Keillor was especially dismissive of the charges, which came right after he wrote a Washington Post commentary in which he ridiculed the demands for Sen. Al Franken to resign over allegedly groping women as ""absurd."" Confident of his sex appeal at age 75, Keillor boasted, ""If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars.""Indeed, there seems to have been something smarmy about Keillor all along. Meet Garrison Keillor: sexual harassment victim. Howard Mortman of C-SPAN tweeted out an old National Press Club address by Keillor from April 7, 1994, in which Keillor proclaimed, ""A world in which there is no sexual harassment at all is a world in which there will not be any flirtation.""XThis line did not make the press accounts at the time. Instead, the Associated Press reported the part of the speech where Keillor ""chided the press"" for trying to keep from the American people the ""terrible truth"" that ""America gets along pretty well,"" and the fact that Clinton ""is a soulful man"" who ""enjoys his work.""Bill Clinton, soulful harasser ... meet Garrison Keillor, soulful harasser.The bifurcated public funding/private business nature of public broadcasting made men like Rose and Keillor less accountable, as there was not always a human resources department to handle complaints. They are profit-making multimillionaire contractors who acted as their own bosses. Their female employees were sitting ducks.In what way, then, is ""public"" broadcasting morally superior to corporate broadcasting? And how deep is the hypocrisy on the left considering it waited decades to hold sexual harassers in its own taxpayer-funded ideological sandboxes accountable? They don't deserve one more red cent from taxpaying Americans.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

371,L,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

377,L,"CNN is airing a bizarre new advertisement with the motto ""Facts First,"" which insists that the network calls an apple an apple, even if critics of its ""news"" reporting argue it's a banana. You see, CNN is interested in objective truth, not opinions. This would be like McDonald's advertising with an apple and saying the company is all about health food.Our ""news"" networks don't deal with facts first. They sell us narratives, and the favorite is the wild speculation about what might happen next to President Trump. For months, they have speculated about how meetings with powerful Russians would be the end of Trump. From Jan. 20 to Oct. 20, the Media Research Center reports, the ABC, CBS and NBC evening-news shows alone gave that story just over 1,000 minutes.But ObamaCare? Budget and taxes? Immigration? A possible nuclear war with North Korea? All are second bananas. It's Trump-Russia, Russia-Trump day in and day out.The Russia narrative they prefer is this: Donald Trump won the presidency due to the help of an autocratic foreign power. But in the last week, a series of investigative reports by The Hill have brought something altogether new to the discussion: facts. And the facts are implicating former President Obama's administration, specifically Hillary Clinton, in some astonishingly unethical, if not illegal, behavior with the Russians. The publication reported:Countless other publications assert that nine investors in Uranium One jointly donated a cool $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.This reads like a fascinating spy novel, but ABC and NBC have offered nothing. Let that sink in. CBS aired one question (and one answer) on ""Face the Nation"" that lasted 69 seconds. CNN, which has spent hour after hour obsessing over Russian collusion with Trump, can hardly be bothered with this narrative.That's ""Facts First"" — media style.Naturally, the usual dishonest Clinton defense emerged: This was ""old news."" When author Peter Schweitzer wrote about this issue in 2015 (without the new developments), he was virtually ignored. And if he was interviewed, hostile treatment is an understatement. Here's how NBC's Savannah Guthrie dealt with ""facts"" back then. She asked Schweitzer: ""Before we get into some of the details, let's put it bluntly: Are you hoping that this book and the issues you raise in it torpedo her candidacy?"" He said no, but she shot back: ""a lot of your critics say, 'Look, you are a conservative and that this is a right-wing hit job.' Are you really claiming to be neutral here?""No one is neutral in the pro-Clinton press corps.

378,L,"Hollywood's hypocrisy about Harvey Weinstein is only outdone by its hypocrisy about gun control.We still don't know why Stephen Paddock unleashed his arsenal in an evil attack on an outdoor concert crowd in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500. But Hollywood's glitterati seem to know, apparently. They quickly and predictably jumped on Twitter and other media outlets to denounce the National Rifle Association as a terrorist and demand ""common sense gun control"" that, as usual, wouldn't have stopped Paddock in any way.So why does America have this problem with mass shootings? Will Hollywood ever look inward on this question and explore its role? Four of the biggest box-office successes in the week leading up to the shooting demonstrated the degree to which Tinseltown is aggressively promoting a culture of gun ultraviolence in America.Matt Philbin of the Media Research Center reported that an astounding 589 incidents of violence were featured ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" ""American Assassin,"" Stephen King's ""It"" and ""mother!"" And that's just four movies. It gets worse: There were no less than 212 incidents of gun violence, and the body count is at least 192. In over 100 incidents of gun violence, some kind of automatic weapon is used (which is why the numbers are undercounted — researchers literally couldn't count fast enough).There are plenty of other forms of violence as well.""It"" is the monster hit of the fall, with a reported domestic box-office take of $315 million and counting. The movie has only three gun scenes, but one features a penetrating captive bolt pistol, which is traditionally used to stun animals prior to slaughter. Victims are stabbed and bludgeoned, and the killer clown even bites off the arm of a little child. ""Mother!"" includes an atrocious scene in which a crowd dismembers and eats a baby.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" was the No. 1 film that weekend. It's the sequel to the hyperviolent ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" which contained one of the grisliest murder scenes that Hollywood has ever produced; in it, the antagonist activates some kind of demonic neurological wave that causes church parishioners to slaughter one another until they're all dead.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" includes 118 incidents of gun violence (70 of them with automatic weapons) and another 164 incidents of other violence. Philbin lists the instances, saying, ""There are body slams, punches, explosions, ripping off limbs, ripping out vocal cords, putting people in meat grinders, cannibalism, lasso violence, slicing people in half and eyes randomly exploding from people's heads.""The Hypocrite in Chief of this production is actress Julianne Moore, who plays the drug-lord supervillain. Moore went on Jimmy Fallon's late-night show to receive the usual love bombs. Fallon said, ""'Kingsman' alone is fantastic!"" Moore responded: ""Thank you! It's a fun movie, right? It's really, really fun.""Since the Vegas mass shooting, Moore's Twitter feed has been stuffed with tweets in which she attacks the NRA and demands gun control legislation. Naturally, nowhere in this October Twitter festival is there any mention of her ""really fun"" hit movie.The Hollywood Reporter, to its credit, asked Moore, ""Do critics who accuse Hollywood of glorifying gunplay have a valid point?"" Moore shot back, ""It is impossible to be killed by watching a violent movie, but unfortunately, it is all too possible to be shot and killed while sitting in a theater and watching any kind of movie.""Hollywood might point the finger of blame for all this violence back on the audience, and there's merit to that argument. The ""Kingsman"" sequel won the weekend box office for two weeks. Before that, ""It"" won for two weeks. And before that, the winner for three consecutive weekends was ... ""The Hitman's Bodyguard.""But does that exonerate Hollywood for feeding the beast?Movie stars have no problem mudslinging against the NRA and blaming it for mass shootings. But they have demonstrated a complete lack of moral introspection about their own glamorization of over-the-top violence with guns ... and everything else. Until they get serious about their own responsibility, they have no right to judge anyone else.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

379,L,"The network news divisions boast about how much they care about the truth and then rage against President Trump when he calls them makers of ""fake news."" But when it comes to the politicians they adore, especially those they wish would run for president, the truth takes a back seat.Exhibit A right now is Elizabeth Warren, who falsely claimed in a professional directory to be descended from Cherokee Indians, so as to be listed as a minority when she was hired as a professor. When Trump makes fun of her by calling her ""Pocahontas,"" the networks get oh so upset and call it a ""racial slur."" But they don't seem to care one iota about how American Indians feel regarding white people who take on a fake minority identity.The story broke during Warren's 2012 campaign against then-Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts. That May, liberal writer Garance Franke-Ruta summarized for The Atlantic: ""the progressive consumer advocate has been unable to point to evidence of Native heritage except for an unsubstantiated third-hand report that she might be 1/32 Cherokee. Even if it could be proven, it wouldn't qualify her to be a member of a tribe."" So a Senate candidate committed a race-based fraud. CBS broadcast programs touched the story once.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn June, Nancy Cordes reported that Warren said her relatives told her of her Cherokee background. Then, Cordes aired this double-lie sound bite from Warren: ""I know my family's heritage. It's also been clear from the very beginning that I never got any special breaks from it."" If she knew her family heritage, why couldn't she document it? Why invent the heritage if not to derive advantages from it?Cordes then neatly bundled and threw away the entire controversy: ""Recent polls show most voters in Massachusetts don't think Warren's heritage is a big deal,"" she said. Those ""truth"" tellers implied that we shouldn't get too disturbed by a little lie to get hired at an Ivy League.NBC also touched it just once that year, on the ""Today"" show on Oct. 2, after David Gregory moderated a Brown-Warren debate. He asked Warren, ""Do you consider yourself a minority?"" She replied: ""I listed myself as Native American. ... It's part of who I am."" Gregory later asked her: ""Are you hiding something?"" Again, Warren lied: ""No, I'm not. I never used it for college, for law school or to get a job.""XOver and out.Just try to put those sentences together: ""I listed myself as Native American in a professional directory ... and I never used it to get a job.""In response, the ""facts first"" media simply walked away. To address this honestly was to call her a liar. PolitiFact has only seven rulings on Warren, four ""Mostly True"" and three ""Half True."" The site has never addressed this lie.By the way, ABC never covered this controversy in 2012.When Trump called her Pocahontas in 2016, the networks brought out the weasel words. ABC's Mary Bruce reported, ""Friday night, Trump hitting hard, attacking her for once claiming she was Native American."" Once claiming? She has claimed it for years. She claimed it throughout the 2012 campaign. She claimed it in five recipes she submitted to a ""Pow Wow Chow"" cookbook.The same routine continued this week when Trump called her Pocahontas while honoring Navajo code talkers from World War II. Nancy Cordes at CBS breezily recounted, ""It's a reference to the Massachusetts senator's past claims of Cherokee ancestry."" But she added: ""Democrats called it a racial slur. Warren called it disturbing.""It's disturbing, all right. It's disturbing that Warren routinely gets a pass on her lies. These are the benefits the liberal media hand out to their favorites.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

380,L,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

382,L,"On Feb. 28, 2016, the entertainment industry gave the Oscar for best picture to ""Spotlight,"" a fictionalized version of The Boston Globe's reporting of sexual abuse and its cover-up within the Catholic Church in Boston. The self-congratulation looks amazing now, after the exposure of decades of alleged harassment, and perhaps even rape, by Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein.""This film gave a voice to survivors, and this Oscar amplifies that voice, which we hope will become a choir that will resonate all the way to the Vatican,"" said ""Spotlight"" producer Michael Sugar. ""Pope Francis, it's time to protect the children and restore the faith.""We can guess no one will make a movie about the decades of harassment by Weinstein and Hollywood's cover-up. And, certainly, no one would win an Oscar for it. No Holy Father in Tinseltown has moral authority. Feminist superstars like Meryl Streep professed they hadn't the slightest idea of what their friend Harvey was doing ... which makes them either profoundly cynical or amazingly clueless.A far more believable response came from French actress Lea Seydoux, who wrote in the Guardian that she was groped by Weinstein. She said: ""Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It's unbelievable that he's been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.""If the liberal intelligentsia found it completely unbelievable that a Catholic bishop might have been uninformed about sexual abuse by priests, then how do they expect anyone to believe it's impossible for the Streeps of Hollywood to be unaware?The news reports on this scandal have underplayed or ignored the deep hypocrisy of Weinstein's business efforts against bullying and sexual assault. His company distributed the documentary ""Bully"" to theaters in 2012. In 2015, it funded and distributed ""The Hunting Ground,"" a documentary pitched as ""a startling expose of rape crimes on U.S. college campuses, their institutional cover-ups and the devastating toll they take on students and their families.""Months after the 2016 Oscars, Hollywood feminists railed against President Donald Trump for a 2005 videotape in which he made crude remarks about what a powerful man can do to women. They shared their outrage on Twitter -- Cher, Patricia Arquette, Debra Messing, Lena Dunham, and Ashley Judd. The day after Trump's inauguration, the Hollywood feminists marched in Washington, D.C., in Park City, Utah (where they hold the Sundance Film Festival), and other cities. There in the Utah ""feminist"" crowd was one Harvey Weinstein.Judd, who notoriously screamed grotesqueries at Trump at the March on Washington, was the first big name to allow her name to be used in The New York Times story on Weinstein. Dunham wrote in the Times that she regretted shaking Weinstein's hand at a Weinstein-organized rally for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She had heard the rumors but ultimately ""made a calculation"" since she desperately wanted Clinton to win.Can today's young women in Hollywood count on an anti-Weinstein ""choir"" to ""resonate"" around the entertainment industry? The Catholic Church has taken dramatic steps to prevent the abuse of children.

385,L,"Charles Pierce, the resident radical-left political pundit at Esquire magazine — that intellectual powerhouse best known for its Sexiest Woman Alive award  — is lamenting the role of Steve Bannon in electing President Trump, as well as Trump financial backers ""Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the reactionary New York gozillionnaires.""Pierce wanted everyone to read about a lawsuit filed in May (news that's almost half a year old is ""breaking"" if the targets are conservatives) by a former Bob Mercer employee named David Magerman who, reportedly against company policy, felt compelled to tell The Wall Street Journal that his boss had ""contempt for the social safety net"" and wanted ""government be shrunk down to the size of a pinhead."" (Horrors!) In his lawsuit, Magerman upped the ante and claimed that Mercer held racist views.Full disclosure: The Mercers are not just supporters; they are friends. That kind of repugnant slur is undeserving of a response and will get none here.Magerman is irrelevant. That lawsuit being described as ""news"" is silly. So, why the story? It's all about ""gozillionaires.""Left-wingers in the media believe gozillionaires are a malignant force in politics — unless they are on the ""right side of history."" The Mercers get an amazing amount of media ink — most of it predictably negative — because they aren't. They are conservatives. Worse, they are rich conservatives. Their wealth is dangerous. They are dangerous. They must be exposed!But check out the Forbes list of top billionaires. At the top of the pile sits Bill Gates, a liberal. Next in line is Warren Buffett, who's also a liberal. He's followed by Jeff Bezos, another liberal. No. 5 is uber-liberal Mark Zuckerberg. No. 10 is Michael Bloomberg, another leftist. George Soros, a radical leftist if ever there was one, registers at No. 30. In fact, there are liberals all over the Forbes World's Billionaires list.You won't find the Mercers in the top 1,000.Quick: When was the last time — or when was there ever a time — you remember a media story that focused on the controversial views of Gates, Buffett, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Bloomberg or Soros?It's quite the opposite. A few months ago, the very same Esquire writer mocked the Trump people for objecting to liberal gozillionaires. According to Pierce, conservatives thought anti-Trump protesters in Washington, D.C., were ""some sort of a plot concocted by George Soros."" To object to political activity by wealthy people on the left is to dabble in cockamamie conspiracy theories, this being just another one of them.Except it was true. The Media Research Center documented that Soros and his Open Society Foundations had contributed $246 million between 2010 and 2014 to 100 of the 544 groups listed as partners of the Women's March on Washington the day after the inauguration. Did the liberal media care? Were they alarmed? They yawned. Soros is on the ""right side of history.""These self-righteous attacks on the Mercers are nothing new. Before Bob and Rebekah Mercer, there were David and Charles Koch. And before them, there was Richard Mellon Scaife, dubbed the ""godfather of the vast right-wing conspiracy"" by some liberals. Twenty years ago, Time magazine's list of the 25 most influential people identified Scaife as a ""conservative agitator"" who controlled foundations that help subsidize ""rabidly anti-Clinton magazines."" Pages later, Time described Soros as a ""philanthropist"" with an ""iconoclastic critique of free-market capitalism.""Liberal gozillionaires are hailed as Time's ""Persons of the Year"" (Bill and Melinda Gates) or get a Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Obama (Buffett). It doesn't hurt that liberal journalists can often thank these billionaires for jobs — or be grateful that their colleagues are employed by them. Buffett, Bloomberg, Zuckerberg and Bezos are all in the left-wing media business now.The same trend applies to leftist foundations like the Ford Foundation (with a $12 billion endowment), The Pew Charitable Trusts ($5 billion-plus endowment) and the Rockefeller Foundation ($4 billion-plus endowment). Toss in the Carnegie Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation and so many more. Is there controversy? Anywhere? Conservatives have nothing to match any of them.As we type these words, it has just been announced that Soros has transferred a cool $18 billion to his radical Open Society Foundations in recent years, making it instantly the second largest foundation in the world after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.But it's still all about the Mercers.

392,L,"The death of CSX (CSX) Chief Executive Officer E. Hunter Harrison just two days after the railroad announced his medical leave resurrects questions about just how much companies should disclose about the health of their leaders.X Harrison, 73, died Saturday of ""unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness,"" CSX said without elaborating. Harrison had been turning around CSX since being hired in March, as he had previously done at three other railroads. News of his declining health had pushed the company's shares down the most in more than six years on Friday.Like former Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs, who battled pancreatic cancer before his death in 2011, Harrison had both health problems and a reputation that buoyed shares in his company. Harrison had bypass heart surgery in 1998 and missed work in 2015 because of pneumonia and the implant of stents in his legs. Before CSX hired him, he declined the company's request for an independent doctor to review his medical records.In May, the Wall Street Journal reported Harrison's use of supplemental oxygen. In response, he said: ""Don't judge me by my medical record, judge me by my performance.""CSX investors cheered Harrison's performance, sending shares up about 60% in this year through Dec. 14, hours before his medical leave was disclosed. Shareholders had approved paying him $84 million he relinquished under a contract at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and Harrison said he planned to guide CSX for the course of his four-year contract.The stock fell 3.3% to $51.16 at 7:19 a.m. in premarket trading Monday in New York, following a 7.6% decline Friday, the biggest drop since September 2011, after the medical leave was announced.""We are confident that our disclosures are adequate and appropriate,"" Bryan Tucker, a CSX spokesman, said via email on Sunday.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules don't require companies to disclose serious health problems in the executive suite, said Allan Horwich, a partner at Schiff Hardin LLP and Northwestern University law professor. That said, a company couldn't issue half-truths or lie about an executive.""The most important thing is whether there were statements made by the company since he was hired that were inconsistent with the true state of his health at the time, and whether the company knew that,"" Horwich said. ""Did they knowingly or recklessly omit facts in what they said about the management team that would expose them to liability?""Disclosures are judged by what the company knew in assessing the future, he said.""If things didn't turn out as they expected, that doesn't mean that the company lied or that the disclosure was defective,"" he said.Disclosure rules for a key executive also must weigh that individual's right to privacy, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.""This is the classic example of when an individual's health is tied dramatically to the success of a company, it becomes a matter of disclosure,"" Elson said. His pay ""would suggest that his presence at the company was considered incredibly important to shareholders and therefore his health would be relevant.""Such situations always raise the risk of litigation, Elson said. ""Any time that people are disappointed and feel the company wasn't as forthright as they should have been, you'll see litigation,"" Elson said. ""But how does anybody know when their time is up?""

397,L,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

401,L,"""The deadliest mass shooting in modern American history."" That was the summary of the horrific end to the country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, with 59 people killed (as we file this) and more than 500 injured. The early network reports were all news, but everyone knew what would follow immediately: an avalanche of liberal anger that gun control wasn't installed to prevent this from happening.The spirit of the ""fact-finding"" and ""objective"" media elite was characterized in a tweet from Cal Perry, a global editor for digital content at NBC News. ""Been a journo for a while now. It has become impossible to report just, 'facts' about gun violence. The fact is America needs gun control.""This is why most Americans distrust ""independent fact checkers"" with media credentials. Emotions trump facts. It's a ""fact"" that Hillary Clinton was the most qualified, deserving Democratic nominee in modern history. It's a ""fact"" that the Russians installed Donald Trump in the presidency. It's a ""fact"" that guns cause violence.It's also a ""fact"" that ""truth"" has a liberal bias, and the media's job is to deliver that ""truth"" with buckets full of gusto.Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw announced once again it was time for a serious conversation about access to deadly weapons: ""I think this is time for a national dialogue that we can have in a calm and reasoned way in which the country can figure out how come we have so many mass shootings in this country,"" since the killer, Stephen Paddock, had assembled an arsenal of guns and ammunition to mow down innocent people.That ""dialogue"" ought to begin by asking these journalists which laws would have prevented these murders. But a dialogue is not what they want. We've been having a dialogue for years and they haven't succeeded. They want a monologue describing just how much gun control we should have.NBC's Matt Lauer continued the monologue: ""Mass shooting is defined as — what is it? Four people, I think, killed is a mass shooting. And those happen almost every day in this country."" Brokaw replied: ""They do happen every day, as a matter of fact, Matt.""No. They don't. Not in the way that most Americans understand the term ""mass shootings."" And any professional, fact-based journalist knows it. Emotions, trumping facts.For raw avoidance of the facts, there's always the late-night ""comedy"" lectures. ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, D-Calif., denounced congressional Republicans. He said Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and others ""who won't do anything about this — because the NRA has their balls in a money clip — also sent their thoughts and their prayers today. Which is good. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it's so crazy.""Try to find a fact in there. The previous message might as well have been brought to you by speechwriters from the office of Senator Charles Schumer.In the realm of actual facts, Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post ""Fact Checker,"" set out to analyze Marco Rubio's claim in 2015 after the mini-jihad in San Bernardino that none of the recent mass shootings would have been prevented by new gun laws. Kessler analyzed the 12 most recent mass shootings and their perpetrators and announced Rubio was correct.Everyone in America mourns these mass shootings. Everyone. But liberals think only they have the compassion and ""common sense"" to end it. Liberals are furious about this because it demonstrates all their liberal media bias and all their liberal celebrity ""consciousness raising"" accomplishes nothing.Evil plotters who have no criminal record are going to be able to buy guns, and they're going to be able to pass background checks, and their plots won't be stopped by the Brady Campaign. Will someone please stick these facts in Tom Brokaw's ""national dialogue"" where they belong?

402,L,"The national media remain obsessed over President Trump's tweets, especially when they can be interpreted as racially inflammatory. Liberal sports journalists spent the summer hoping and wondering when the original national anthem kneeler, Colin Kaepernick, was going to get another quarterback job in the NFL. It never happened, so some (predictably) saw Racist America at work, punishing Kaepernick for his courageous stance (or kneel).President Trump apparently lost patience with this nonsense and tweeted: ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect ... our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, you're fired. Find something else to do!""Ka-boom. The left heard echoes of racism and censorship, as well as flag-waving patriotism, actions they always find distasteful and exploitative. The media leapt all over the controversy, which spurred cowardly NFL teams to make even stauncher displays of contempt for the flag. So they knelt, or arrogantly sat, or showboated by not coming out at all.Fans everywhere responded by burning their jerseys in disgust.This is nothing but counterproductive for the NFL. Showy protests during the national anthem dishonor the military and insult this country and all who live here. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who would have disciplined Kaepernick for wearing green cleats, punted, as did the owners. The NFL wouldn't even let Dallas add a helmet sticker to honor police officers after five were shot dead at a Black Lives Matter protest.Kaepernick started this fight, insisting, ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color."" He was oppressed to the tune of $39 million over the last three years of his career. Millions of his supposed oppressors were not.But the media made it sound like Trump started this feud. ""Insulter in chief,"" announced ABC's Martha Raddatz on ""This Week."" Trump was ""attacking freedom of speech and star athletes."" Raddatz cited a new ABC News/Washington Post poll showing ""66% of all Americans, including nearly 4 in 10 conservatives think Trump has done more to divide the country than unite it. Instead of bringing the country together, he has proved to be a provocateur.""Black Lives Matter rioters and their athletic supporters are somehow never the provocateurs. Tactics like burning down buildings and throwing rocks and urine-filled bottles at the police aren't questioned. They're dismissed with journalistic weasel words like ""the protests were largely peaceful.""Blame President Trump. It's always President Trump. President Obama was presumed to be a uniter, which is to say the media projected him as one. The polls said he wasn't. Three years ago, the same ABC News/Washington Post poll found 55% found Obama to be divisive, and 38% disagreed. ABC News buried that poll in a dumpster.Instead they spun. They always spin for Obama. Washington Post political reporter Aaron Blake made excuses for the first black president: ""Of course, saying Obama is divisive isn't quite the same as blaming him for failing to unite the country. Some might see Obama as divisive just by the nature of who he is and/or think he didn't stand much of a chance to unite a very polarized country.""The liberal media are shameless hypocrites when they polarize the country and then complain the country is polarized. They have honored Kaepernick as some kind of ""star-spangled"" patriot and pushed his radical racial agenda. They have pressured the NFL and every other televised sports league to take liberal stands on everything from race to gun control to imposing transgender bathrooms.And when those leagues inevitably see their ratings drop, the media will try to claim this loss of popularity has nothing to do with politics ... just as they do about their own ever-declining ""news"" ratings.
"
403,L,"As the media elites roll their eyes and sigh at people who deny the apparently inevitable approach of traumatic climate change, there's one category of denial they always endorse: a liberal bias in the ""news."" Chest-pounding journalistic activism defines the Trump era, and yet shameless journalists still claim media bias is a myth.James Warren, a former managing editor and chief of the Chicago Tribune Washington, D.C., bureau, now works at The Poynter Institute for media studies (or media denial?). He posted a commentary on Nov. 20 headlined ""How Mega-Media Deals Further Erode the Myth of a 'Liberal' Media.""Liberals made fun of Mitt Romney when he claimed that ""corporations are people,"" but they subscribe to the cartoonish idea that ""corporations are all conservative."" Corporations have a profit motive, so that somehow inexorably translates to Republican propaganda?Rupert Murdoch is looking at unloading some of his Hollywood assets, and among the suspected potential buyers are The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). To Warren, this somehow heralds a new era of ""not just unceasing consolidation but the unceasing influence of folks of distinctly conservative ideology."" The Murdochs explore selling off assets, and that's conservative consolidation?Not only that, Warren says the ""caricature"" of a liberal media is ""dubious"" and can be rebutted by the fact that the ""aggressively conservative"" Sinclair Broadcasting Group ""is primed to become the biggest local TV broadcaster."" Yet Sinclair stations are routinely airing network news and entertainment content from ... ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.Warren then rounds up academics who sound like they never read or watch the liberal media. Matthew Baum, the Marvin Kalb professor of global communications at the Harvard Kennedy School, claims that conservatives ""mostly point to the political views of journalists at mainstream media outlets, who tend to lean Democratic."" He adds: ""Of course, the core journalistic norm of balance and objectivity run directly counter to that. So at minimum it isn't obvious why personal political views would trump professional norms."" He then argues that some ""research"" shows that ""news reporting tends to reflect the interests of ownership,"" so that predicts ""a more pro-conservative bias.""It's official: This professor sounds dumber than a grade schooler.XHe seems to have ignored every story written or broadcast over the last two years about President  Trump and his allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic voters, as the ""professional norms"" have included demeaning Trump and the Republicans as a dangerously ignorant gang shredding democracy.Warren then cites Danny Hayes, a political scientist at George Washington University who doubles down on the idiocy. ""The debate about ideological bias in the media is not productive at all,"" he says. That's true ... if you're a liberal who wants the average (and, apparently, ignorant) media consumer to think the news is objective. Hayes insists ""the social science research finds virtually no evidence in the mainstream media of systematic liberal or conservative bias.""Hayes should be teaching geology because, clearly, he is living under a rock. We've been churning out daily evidence of a dramatic liberal bias in the ""objective"" news media for 30 years, and this ""scientist"" in Washington, D.C., thinks there's ""virtually no evidence""?This is a little like arguing that ""research"" shows there's virtually no evidence of pro football players kneeling during the national anthem this season.

419,L,"In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment/assault scandal, allegedly feminist entertainers are being accused left ... and left. The latest is comedian/Sen. Al Franken. Photographic evidence undeniably proved that he placed his hands over a woman's breasts while she was asleep on an airplane returning from a USO tour in 2006. The woman, KABC radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, added that he forced his tongue down her throat during a rehearsal of a skit for the soldiers.Now ask yourself: What if Franken's most hated rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, had been pictured doing exactly that to a sleeping woman on a plane, with the same goofy smile? And had tongue-kissed her beforehand? Wouldn't the media/Democrat complex want him immediately purged from the Senate?Last year, the media demanded Donald Trump's political head when they found old audio of him boasting to Billy Bush of ""Access Hollywood"" about how he could sexually harass women because he was a ""star."" NBC canned Bush just for giggling at Trump's boasts on the tape. Trump was only proved to have talked about groping. He wasn't photographed doing it. But Hillary Clinton was quoted everywhere for shamelessly tweeting: ""This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.""MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle lectured Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, saying: ""You're a mother. You're a woman. Are you more offended by the phrase 'average Americans' or 'grabbing a woman's genitals'? ... you've got to look at your kids when you go home at night. ... I'm not going to let my kids watch the debate tonight.""As the Franken scandal unfolds, the media and Democrats have insisted that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore cannot win the seat due to allegations that he had sexual contact with teenagers. There's no photograph here either. There is no admission of guilt like Franken's. But journalists demanded the voters of Alabama tar and feather Moore.XABC's Martha Raddatz complained: ""I don't really know what those voters are waiting for."" On MSNBC, John Heilemann lectured Republicans, saying: ""Right now, your party ... seems to be divided over the question of pedophilia by its standard-bearer in the Alabama Senate race,"" suggesting that the Republican Party can no longer be a ""plausible party in American life.""Plausible party? Put aside for a minute whether Heilemann — whose longtime co-author and TV partner Mark Halperin has now admitted gross sexual harassment — can pass judgment on anyone. Just about every liberal or Democrat who has served in the past 20 years lacks any right to pass judgment on these matters after their decades of tolerance of former President Bill Clinton's sexual harassment and abuse of power. When Trump brought Clinton accusers Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick to a conference before the second presidential debate last October, the women were smeared by journalists as ""political props,"" cogs in a ""Soviet show trial"" and a ""twisted version of 'the Last Supper.'""Only now have they begun to confess their apathy and insults toward Clinton's accusers, and that's only after the Clintons have no clear path back to the White House.Will this scandal end with Roy Moore and Al Franken both losing a seat in the Senate?

421,L,"The fall premieres have begun on prime-time TV, and just when you thought we couldn't sink lower into the cesspool, there are new ""milestones"" for the liberal cultural commissars to honor. The Daily Beast reported with great pride that the Amazon show ""Transparent"" will have TV's first transgender full-frontal nude shot, during a massage scene. They're also cheering NBC's reboot of the LGBT ""ally"" comedy ""Will & Grace,"" with new insults about Republicans for their gay friends, like Newt Gingrich is a ""man, but he's aged into a lesbian.""What the elite television critics will not endorse are three new shows with military themes, offering what Time magazine calls a ""calorie-free take on American patriotism."" They are ""SEAL Team"" on CBS, ""The Brave"" on NBC and ""Valor"" on The CW. Cynics can suggest these shows are aimed at President Trump supporters, but no one can say Hollywood thought Hillary Clinton would be hiking in the woods at this point when they developed these programs.The producers may have trouble selling these shows abroad, The Hollywood Reporter suggested, quoting an executive for a Swedish TV network: ""These shows are all really well-made and the production values are great, but some of it is pretty jingoistic: lots of breast-beating and flag-flying.""Time TV critic Daniel D'Addario declared, ""War provides an innately compelling hook for these shows, but there's something unpleasant and hectoring about how bluntly incurious they are about what it all might mean."" He's using a term — ""bluntly incurious"" — that served as their working definition of George W. Bush.It's apparently too trite, too predictable to portray soldiers as hardworking people, and that terrorism is bad. The Time critic lectured how ""true patriotism means wanting one's homeland to be the best it can, not just repeating three times a week that it already is.""In other words, the storyline's mission should be to find flaws in America.D'Addario recoils at the tough talk. On NBC's show, the deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency lectures: ""We are fighting people that want to wipe us off the planet. That means we have to be as ruthless as they are."" Later, another character declares: ""I'm not saying I'm gonna enjoy killing these guys, but you kidnap a woman, you get what you deserve.""So what's wrong with that? Apparently, when bad guys kidnap Americans, you should fix it with hugs and affirmations. ""These shows seem to be trying to provoke a vengeful growl from the audience,"" Time's TV critic complained. ""'Homeland,' in its lesser moments, had similarly nasty paranoid outlines. But that show has been more adept at moral ambiguity.""By ""moral ambiguity,"" he surely means turning the ""nasty paranoid outlines"" back on the U.S. government, the ""national security state."" That's what ""Homeland"" did, and that's what satisfies the left. Or take the ABC series ""Quantico,"" which ended its season in May by exposing a Trumpesque president taking orders on merging the FBI and the CIA from ... Russia.Maybe these military shows will find an audience, and maybe they won't. But critics have underlined they'd rather watch ""milestones"" of transgender nudity than a show that might glamorize and humanize Navy SEALs.

You want a healthy shakeout of weak, uncommitted holders before a breakout takes place.Floor & Decor has a market cap of $4.2 billion and a float of 83 million shares. The 98 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup is strong and reflects a long string of excellent earnings and revenue increases.Analysts on consensus see Floor & Decor's earnings rising 16% to 66 cents a share in 2017, then accelerating with a 29% gain to 85 cents next year.However, keep in mind that the company faces very tough year-over-year comparisons in the next few quarters. For instance, earnings per share have bolted 100%, 114%, 133%, 64%, 75%, 47% and 21% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters. But in the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to fall 11% to 16 cents a share before rising 21% to 17 cents in the first quarter of 2018.The Street sees sales growing 33% to $370.1 million in Q4 this year and 27% to $389.7 million in Q1 2018.Square (SQ) cut early losses but is still down nearly 3% to 37.17. Volume looks poised to double vs. its 50-day average of 15.6 million shares. The point of sale transaction technology innovator still holds a solid gain of 32% after clearing a flat base at 28.07 in October. But a break of an upper channel last week indicated that Square needs some time to cool off and consolidate its big gains.The Street sees fourth-quarter earnings rising 40% to 7 cents a share, following EPS increases of 250% and 600% in the prior two quarters.Elsewhere, crude oil futures fell as the U.S. dollar rose. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note was around 2.38%, up from a Sept. 7 near-term low of 2.05%. Higher interest rates likely improve the net interest margins for certain lenders.Financial brokers, meanwhile, would likely be able to earn more interest-related revenue on margin loans.LPL Financial (LPLA) hopped more than 3% higher to 54.76, surpassing a 54.02 buy point in a flat base in heavy volume. The financial advisor has strung together three quarters in a row of single-digit revenue growth following a six-quarter drought in sales.RELATED:Who Are The Next Big IPO Leaders?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Find Excellent Growth Stocks: Start HereFinding Great Stocks: A Peek Inside The IBD 50The Latest In Investor's Corner

423,L,"The liberal narrative on President Donald Trump assumes his election is evidence that America is returning to its racist roots. In the angst-ridden aftermath, the media found vindication by reporting all kinds of ""hate crime"" incidents, lurching so eagerly that they fell for a few that turned out to be hoaxes. Any media outlet that leaps on a small incident of vandalism as a grand statement on Where America Stands ought to have the courage to make a public acknowledgment when the story is fraudulent. To do otherwise is to stoke racial fires with dishonesty.And that's precisely what they're doing.On Sept. 29, a shocking story came out of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Five black cadets at the Air Force Academy Preparatory School found racist messages like ""Go home, (N-word)"" written outside their rooms. The head of the Air Force Academy, Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria, had the entire student body stand while he demanded that the racist perpetrator(s) leave. It was humiliating. Put yourself in the shoes of the cadets forced to endure this tongue-lashing.This turned into a national story. On CNN ""Newsroom,"" Brooke Baldwin offered 11 minutes of airtime to a news report on the story and an interview with Silveria. And CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" added another seven minutes that included another Silveria interview. ""CBS Evening News"" offered two minutes and 45 seconds on it, and ""NBC Nightly News"" gave it about two minutes. PBS ""NewsHour"" offered a minute.It confirmed a liberal narrative: The U.S. military has a racism problem. But on Nov. 7, the academy reported that one of the black cadet ""victims"" had written the messages. It was a hoax, a vicious, ugly hoax. Some of the news outlets reported this. Baldwin offered three minutes, but not the Burnett program. PBS gave it 22 seconds. But CBS and NBC couldn't find the time. They were comfortable just leaving the fake news of racism uncorrected.XAt Kansas State University, Dauntarius Williams reported that his car had been vandalized with graffiti that said ""Go home (N-word) boy"" and other messages. The Kansas City Star reported the story on Nov. 1, complete with a headline that said ""students are fed up"" and a quote from an outraged black student who complained the college campus doesn't have a multicultural center.This story was another lie. On Nov. 6, the Riley County Police Department reported that Williams confessed to doing the graffiti himself and he would not be charged with filing a false report, since he ""expressed sincere regret that his actions had resulted in the negative media attention."" Williams said, ""It was just a Halloween prank that got out of hand."" He had called the Star after the incident and said he was a Kansas State student. He lied about that, too.On Sept. 8, 19-year-old Yasmin Seweid pleaded guilty to lying to police last December when she claimed that she had been harassed by drunk white men on the New York City subway who yelled anti-Islam slurs and chanted ""Donald Trump!"" The CBS News website, New York Daily News and BuzzFeed had all fallen for the lie.On Fox's ""The Five,"" Greg Gutfeld blasted BuzzFeed for its response to the hoax. The headline was ""Woman Arrested For Allegedly Making Up Story of NY Subway Attack by Trump Supporters."" Now compare that to the original BuzzFeed headline of the incident: ""Drunk Men Yelling 'Donald Trump' Attempt to Remove Woman's Hijab on NYC Subway."" There was no ""allegedly."" According to BuzzFeed's headline, the hoax itself was ""alleged"" and might be real. Even today, while its stories admit the reality, the awful headlines keep lying.And then the press wonders why America has more trust in used car salesmen.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

424,L,"Stocks slumped on Tuesday and the Dow Jones industrial average led the decline, falling more than 0.4%. The 30-component blue chip index gained 2.9% last week, its biggest weekly gain of the year.XThe S&P 500 was off 0.4% while the Nasdaq composite squandered early gains of 0.9% to finish down 0.2%. Volume dropped on both exchanges, according to early data. Small caps got hit hard with the Russell 2000 down 1%.Meanwhile, megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) flexed relative strength, and the 0.8% rebound in the latter is perhaps more important. Why? The parent of Google is trying stay on the north side of its fast-rising 50-day moving average and preserve at least some gains since clearing a 1,006.29 buy point in a flat base in October.Apple was off about 0.1% at 169.64 but is maintaining an air cushion above its own 50-day line. Shares of the iPhone, iPad and MacBook giant are also still a touch extended from the proper buy zone after the stock broke out of a good cup with handle at 160.97 on Oct. 27.Alphabet holds a solid Composite Rating of 93 on a scale of 1 to 99 on IBD Stock Checkup.Top industry groups included a few defensive industries, including funeral services and tobacco, also rallied 0.7% or more.Department store, ship transport, oil machinery, oilfield services, metal ores, electric utility and water utility shares got pounded with declines of 1% or more. West and Southwest banks and homebuilders also fell hard.Top homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) sank for a third straight session, losing 1.3% to 66.84. But shares remain firmly above the key 50-day moving average.LGI, which specializes in homes for first-time buyers, has risen more than 90% past a 34.94 early entry in a long saucerlike base.Miami-based homebuilding giant Lennar (LEN) dropped 1.5% to 62.06 in light turnover. Shares are still acting fine since an Oct. 3-4 breakout from a 15-week flat base with a 55.85 entry. The gain got as high as 14%.Lennar, much like what Apple has done, is engineering a mini turnaround in profits, which fell 75% and 4% vs. year-ago levels in the first two quarters of the current fiscal year ended in November. But in the August-ended fiscal third quarter, Lennar grew earnings 5% on a 15% sales jump, and Q4 earnings are expected to accelerate, rising 10% to $1.48 a share.Building is the top sector among the 33 tracked by IBD in its stock research tables. See the sector rankings by going to IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section at Investors.com, then click on ""Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.""Back to Apple, the megacap is outperforming the Dow Jones industrials with a 46% year-to-date return, excluding dividends. Apple, which also pays a quarterly cash dividend of 63 cents a share, has rallied nearly 49% since its breakout from a bottoming base pattern in early January.That bottoming base was an excellent stage-one cup with handle, showing a 118.12 buy point.Elsewhere, Snap (SNAP) jumped 10% to 14.92 in double normal turnover on a bullish note by a Barclays analyst, who noted that 2018 could mark a turnaround in fundamentals.A turnaround, in fact, is badly needed as the Venice, Calif.-based social network is seeing huge red ink and a slowdown in user growth.While Snap may seem like a ""bargain"" to some traders since shares are still 49% below the 29.44 all-time peak, keep in mind that it's still not clear whether Snap will show the spending discipline in order to turn a profit.Sales growth is marvelous, with the top line growing 406%, 286%, 153% and 62% in the past four quarters. But the growth rate is certainly slowing.The company lost a combined 62 cents a share over those four total quarters and is expected to notch a net loss of 16 cents per share in Q4. As a result, Snap gets a dismal 3 EPS Rating (1 is the worst, 99 the best) and a 15 Composite score from IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:Investor's Corner: When To Buy A Stock After Its IPOWho Are The New Stock Market Winners?How To Find Top New IPOs: Use This IBD ScreenHow To Spot Major Stock Market Tops: Here Is The Easy WayFinding Outstanding Stocks Today: Peek Inside The IBD 50

425,L,"Of all the ridiculous excuses Hillary Clinton could possibly make on her book tour to explain why she couldn't win the 2016 presidential election, the most ridiculous has to be that the national media favored Donald Trump.The easiest way to point and laugh? Witness the Clinton-loving media greet that ludicrous insult as very credible and worth considering. The folks on NBC's ""Today"" show just nodded along. Clinton unspooled her guilt trip in a video interview with Ezra Klein for the leftist site Vox. She claimed, ""We don't control the media environment the same way the right does.""Call it The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy 2.0. She did the exact same thing during the Monica Lewinsky mess: blamed the right. And Bill Clinton always blamed the press when things went sour.Then, she unloaded a number. ""But really, Ezra, when you get 32 minutes in a whole year to cover all policy, how does that work?"" That refers to a study by the Tyndall Report that said the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs provided only 32 minutes of stories solely on policy, as opposed to campaign stories that mentioned the candidates' daily talking points on policy.It's not crazy to say the media focused more on personalities and outrageous statements, just as Clinton's own commercials did. But it's simply disingenuous — Clintonian — to state that policy drew 32 minutes of coverage in 11 months.Clinton also complained in her book that many in the media ""can't bear to face their own role in helping elect Trump, from providing him free airtime to giving my emails three times more coverage than all the issues affecting people's lives combined."" The footnote for that howler of a statement is an embarrassingly terrible study from Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society; it's ""press"" sample included blogs and tweets and was judged by a computer, not actual humans.A Media Research Center study of stories from Jan. 1, 2016, to the day before the election found that the network evening newscasts devoted more than twice as much time to Trump's controversies (1,032 minutes) than to Clinton's (488 minutes). About half of that, 245 minutes, was on her use of a private email server.Nevertheless, CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter respectfully aired several snippets of Clinton's laughable criticisms on his show. To her credit, reporter Amy Chozick, who traveled with the Clinton campaign for The New York Times, pushed back. ""It was a little bit like it was our job to get Hillary Clinton elected,"" she said. Bingo! She added: ""Don't forget they wanted to run against Donald Trump. They wanted him to get all the legitimate Republicans out of the way.""Chozick also argued that if Clinton had desperately wanted to talk about the issues and not her email practices, she did a terrible job of granting interviews. She stated: ""The Times probably put in 50 interview requests to talk about her jobs plan, economics, national security, foreign policy. I asked to talk about her time at the Children's Defense Fund, her work with women. ... They were very cautious. They said no to all of that.""One reason Trump dominated the airtime is Clinton refused to give a press conference for more than nine months. The press just accepted that. They didn't punish her for it. By contrast, Trump had 15 or 16 in that time span and granted a pile of interviews.All this demonstrates that the media display no self-respect when it's suggested they were all Trump lackeys without a conscience for the country. Where's the fight? Where's the rebuttal? Where's the disgust with such a shameless falsehood? The chin stroking just underlines that they were in Clinton's pantsuit pocket then and they remain there today.

426,L,"Consider it a minor miracle. Some brave souls in Hollywood have made a movie about then-Sen. Ted Kennedy's actions in the car accident that left Mary Jo Kopechne dead and abandoned on Massachusetts' Chappaquiddick Island in the summer of 1969. It even stars well-known actors like Bruce Dern, Ed Helms, Kate Mara and Jim Gaffigan. It just debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival.At this moment, one could imagine it as a counterreaction to taking down Confederate statues. If there's anything in our modern history that needs a reassessment — or just a reality check — it's the hidebound mythology around Kennedy, that noble ""Lion of the Senate.""Some predictable protests broke out from the mythmakers. Former Washington Post reporter Sharon Waxman complained on The Wrap News Inc. website: ""I'm not entirely sure why anyone chose to make this movie right now. We hardly lack in narratives that debunk the Kennedy mystique. Indeed, the Kennedys' moral failings are hardly what ails our democracy at this time. Many of us wish there was a Kennedy-esque figure to offer leadership in place of the moral chasm that faces the nation right now.""It is always so when it's a Democrat. Throughout 2016, we were told that Hillary Clinton's past scandals were irrelevant. Then-President Obama's scandals? A thing of the past. Former President Bill Clinton's imbroglios? We needed to move on. Indeed, that's why the MoveOn group was born.In this case, it's even worse. The liberal-media establishment — comprised of the ones who proclaimed from the rooftops that it was mandatory for Donald Trump to abandon his presidential campaign for having boasted to ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush off camera that he could grab women in the crotch because he was a ""star"" — has always believed that leaving a woman behind in an overturned car to drown wasn't at all immoral or disqualifying for the presidency ... when you're ""Kennedy-esque.""But there was more than one minor miracle. Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman took the opposite take. He wrote: ""Kopechne's body was found in a position that implied that she was struggling to keep her head out of the water. And what the film suggests is that once the car turned upside down, she didn't die; she was alive and then drowned, after a period of time, as the water seeped in.""Then, the film critic went for the solar plexus, saying, ""This makes Edward Kennedy's decision not to report the crime a clear-cut act of criminal negligence — but in spirit (if not legally), it renders it something closer to an act of killing."" He asserted that the Kennedy dynasty using its wealth and power to squash the case is ""the essence of what Chappaquiddick means.""Both critics agreed that the movie tells the story in an emotionally detached and clinical manner. Gleiberman said, ""It simply delivers the truth of what happened: the logistical truth of the accident, and also the squirmy truth of what went on in Ted Kennedy's soul.""The news media will be left with two options when this movie comes out: They can ignore it, just as they did to hard-hitting books like Leo Damore's best-selling ""Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquadick Cover-Up"" in 1988. Or, if it's too successful to ignore, they can denounce the filmmakers and attempt to shame them as greedheads, just as liberals like Barbara Walters did in 2012 when Mimi Alford came out with a book in which she wrote how then-President John F. Kennedy sexually exploited her when she was a 19-year-old White House intern.For more than half a century, the media elite has presented the Kennedys in oozy, honorific terms as a gallant band of devout Irish Catholic public servants. And they wonder why people denounce them for spreading ""fake news.""See How To Quickly Find The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch

434,L,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were essentially flat early Tuesday morning, while Dow industrials continued to outperform and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back.X For a second straight session, the S&P 500 dipped Monday as top techs such as chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Micron Technology (MU), ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) crashing through key support in recent days, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbling through its 50-day line on Monday.Losses by chips and leading techs such as Facebook (FB), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) offset gains by financials, retailers, transports and media companies.It's hard for the market to advance without the chip sector. Not only are key parts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index, but they are involved in so many other tech fields. Nvidia is a great example with its graphics chips and cards expanding from PC gaming fields to autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and even Bitcoin mining.S&P 500 index futures were just a fraction above fair value. Dow industrial futures climbed 0.3% after blue chips added 0.2% in Monday's stock market trading. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.3% after the composite closed down 1.1%.Nvidia tried to retake its 50-day moving average on Monday, but reversed hard to close down 5.6% to 186.66, nearly 15% off its Nov. 20 peak.The recent heavy-volume retreat suggests investors may consider taking profits in the highflier. The stock is still slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point, but don't let a 10%+ gain turn into nothing or a loss.Nvidia fell 0.9% in premarket trading.Micron Technology has fallen for six straight sessions, starting when Morgan Stanley predicted that memory chip prices will fall. Micron fell below its 50-day line last Thursday and found resistance at the level the past two sessions.Micron edged lower early Tuesday.Chip-equipment makers ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research plunged through their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume on Nov. 29, flashing clear sell signals. The chip-equipment makers have continued to fall since then.ASML and Lam Research edged lower in early trading, while Applied Materials was not yet active.ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research have the biggest market caps among IBD's chip-equipment group. The eight largest chip-gear firms are all below their 50-day lines.Not every chip stock is in freefall.Intel (INTC), the world's largest chipmaker and a Dow component, has pulled back modestly in recent weeks, but remains above its 50-day moving average. Intel has expanded from chips for the PC market to data centers and, greatly aided by its Mobileye acquisition, targeting the automotive market.Broadcom (AVGO) also has pulled back, testing a recent buy point on Monday before rebounding somewhat. But it's in better health than most.

435,L,"The latest telecast of the Emmy Awards on CBS drew the second-lowest audience ever, just 11.4 million, and that is no surprise. This show could not have been more predictable, quickly devolving into a boorish hourslong festival of Trump bashing and Hillary mourning.Awards shows used to be blockbusters for TV. But in the Age of Trump, they're becoming screaming political spectacles, like the infamous funeral/pep rally for Sen. Paul Wellstone in 2002. The red-state audience knows it's going to be a leftist hootenanny attack on conservatives all night long. Why put up with it? So they don't bother.Naturally, the Hollywood crowd gave out Emmy awards like candy to ""Saturday Night Live"" for its sneering satire of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. And Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton for her alleged ""grace and grit.""Jane Fonda recalled her film ""9 to 5,"" saying, ""Back in 1980 in that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot."" Her co-star Lily Tomlin picked up the attack, saying, ""And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.""Got it.Picking up the Emmy for best actor in a comedy series for the FX show ""Atlanta,"" Donald Glover announced: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most oppressed list. He's the reason I'm probably up here.""Host Stephen Colbert even compared Trump to Walter White, the murderous drug kingpin at the center of ""Breaking Bad."" He joked: ""I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You like Walter White. He's just Walter Much Whiter.""Hilarious.There's another obvious reason awards shows have been slipping: who's nominated and who wins. Much like the Oscars, Emmy voters lurch toward excess, the egregiously sexy and violent and progressive/""transgressive"" products. Popular shows are often rejected because, well, they're popular, which must mean they're not smart enough or they're just too formulaic and predictable.Shows on the Big Four networks get slighted for cable networks and streaming services. Here are the top Emmy winners by network in 2017: 29 for HBO, 20 for Netflix, 15 for NBC and 10 for Hulu. By contrast, ABC won seven. Subtract NBC's nine awards for ""Saturday Night Live"" and it won only six. CBS got four.The Emmy for best drama hasn't gone to a broadcast network since 2006, and in that span, voters have given four to ""Mad Men"" (AMC), two to ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC) and two to ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO). A top-rated show like CBS's ""NCIS"" doesn't get nominated for Emmys ... unless you count ""outstanding stunt coordination."" But Logo's drag-queen show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" won three Emmys in 2017.There's also little suspense when the same liberal favorites win Emmys over and over. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her sixth Emmy in a row for HBO's ""Veep."" Yawn. It doesn't matter that the ratings are tiny. Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show"" won for 10 years in a row. Why tune in for that? And why don't the over-rewarded liberals have the decency to let someone else get an award? Why don't they redistribute Emmys?Hollywood loves to be ahead of the people, ""educating"" them along the path to progress. But it gets remarkably upset when the people refuse to follow it. The people are supposed to bend their minds agreeably as the entertainment elite sculpts the ""arc of justice."" A few swift kicks at the morons from the eminentoes on the Emmy stage are expected to work their magic.Check out all of IBD's Political coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.IBD can help you make more money in stocks.

437,L,"Stocks jumped out of the starting gate Monday as positive New York-region manufacturing data helped boost the premarket session.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each opened 0.2% higher, pushing to new highs. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.3%, grabbing another new high of its own.Investors were keeping an eye early Monday on fighting between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk, and on Israel and Syria, after Israeli forces launched a retaliatory strike against a missile launching facility east of Damascus.The Dow and S&P 500 are both sitting on top of five-week advances. The Nasdaq has climbed for three weeks, and all three closed last week at new highs. This week's outcome is likely to be affected by earnings reports. Netflix (NFLX) reports after today's close, and the pace picks up on Tuesday, with Goldman Sachs (GS), UnitedHealth (UNH), Cree (CREE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among the names expected to report.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) led with a 1.5% gain. American Express (AXP) took the hardest early hit, down 0.8%.Apple (AAPL) scaled up 1% in early trade, after KeyBanc Securities upgraded the stock to overweight from sector weight. The note said iPhone X pricing, the increase of iPhone 8/8+ and a change to its storage pricing ""represent a more aggressive strategy to segment its customer base and extract incremental gross profit from its users than we previously expected.""Apple shares rose through resistance at the stock's 10-week moving average. Shares have made themselves comfortable below that line for the past month, but a three-week advance has started the right side of a possible new base.Among the big tech FANG stocks, Netflix gained 0.5% in premarket action ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. The stock ended Friday at the very top of its buy range, a fraction less than 5% past a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Consensus views are calling for a big earnings gain, up 167%, for Netflix' third quarter, on top of a 30% rise in revenue.Biotech Exelixis (EXEL) soared 22% at the open. The company said the Food and Drug Administration granted a priority review of its kidney cancer treatment. Exelixis shares ended Friday pulled back 16% from a late-August high, in a possible six-week cup base.Charles Schwab (SCHW) dropped 0.9%, after narrowly topping earnings targets and narrowly missing revenue growth views in its third-quarter report. The stock ended Friday just above a 44.20 buy point in a three-month cup base.China-based names led the IBD 50 list. Chian Lodging GroupHTHT powered up more than 2%,  YY (YY) jumped 1.7% . Both stocks are extended and near new highs.Tampa, Fla.-based insurance broker Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ) bolted 8% higher, after clobbering analysts earnings and revenue growth expectations for its third quarter, and announced a $50 million share repurchase initiative. The stock ended Friday still 49% below its Aug. 30 high, but up 50% from a late September low as it rebounds from the selloff that followed Hurricane Irma.Economic news gets off to a positive start for the week, with the New York Federal Reserve Bank reporting a surge in regional manufacturing in October, sending its Empire State Manufacturing Survey to a reading of 30.2, up from 24.4 in September — its best month in three years. That was far above consensus expectations, which called for the index to weaken to a reading of 20.The report showed longer delivery times and a decrease in inventory levels, both negative. But new orders and shipments were sharply higher, pointing to ""ongoing solid gains.""Oil prices traded up 1.4%, with West Texas Intermediate holding above $52 a barrel and approaching its late-September high. Copper spiked almost 3%, nearing a three-year high, after data showed China's copper imports surged in September and a central bank governor forecast an uptick in GDP growth to 7% in the second half of the year, just ahead of this week's Communist Party Congress.China's markets posted a mixed session Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising 0.8%.

438,L,"Of all the ridiculous excuses Hillary Clinton could possibly make on her book tour to explain why she couldn't win the 2016 presidential election, the most ridiculous has to be that the national media favored Donald Trump.The easiest way to point and laugh? Witness the Clinton-loving media greet that ludicrous insult as very credible and worth considering. The folks on NBC's ""Today"" show just nodded along. Clinton unspooled her guilt trip in a video interview with Ezra Klein for the leftist site Vox. She claimed, ""We don't control the media environment the same way the right does.""Call it The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy 2.0. She did the exact same thing during the Monica Lewinsky mess: blamed the right. And Bill Clinton always blamed the press when things went sour.Then, she unloaded a number. ""But really, Ezra, when you get 32 minutes in a whole year to cover all policy, how does that work?"" That refers to a study by the Tyndall Report that said the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs provided only 32 minutes of stories solely on policy, as opposed to campaign stories that mentioned the candidates' daily talking points on policy.It's not crazy to say the media focused more on personalities and outrageous statements, just as Clinton's own commercials did. But it's simply disingenuous — Clintonian — to state that policy drew 32 minutes of coverage in 11 months.Clinton also complained in her book that many in the media ""can't bear to face their own role in helping elect Trump, from providing him free airtime to giving my emails three times more coverage than all the issues affecting people's lives combined.""The footnote for that howler of a statement is an embarrassingly terrible study from Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society; it's ""press"" sample included blogs and tweets and was judged by a computer, not actual humans.A Media Research Center study of stories from Jan. 1, 2016, to the day before the election found that the network evening newscasts devoted more than twice as much time to Trump's controversies (1,032 minutes) than to Clinton's (488 minutes). About half of that, 245 minutes, was on her use of a private email server.Nevertheless, CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter respectfully aired several snippets of Clinton's laughable criticisms on his show.To her credit, reporter Amy Chozick, who traveled with the Clinton campaign for The New York Times, pushed back. ""It was a little bit like it was our job to get Hillary Clinton elected,"" she said. Bingo! She added: ""Don't forget they wanted to run against Donald Trump. They wanted him to get all the legitimate Republicans out of the way.""Chozick also argued that if Clinton had desperately wanted to talk about the issues and not her email practices, she did a terrible job of granting interviews.She stated: ""The Times probably put in 50 interview requests to talk about her jobs plan, economics, national security, foreign policy. I asked to talk about her time at the Children's Defense Fund, her work with women. ... They were very cautious. They said no to all of that.""One reason Trump dominated the airtime is Clinton refused to give a press conference for more than nine months. The press just accepted that. They didn't punish her for it. By contrast, Trump had 15 or 16 in that time span and granted a pile of interviews.All this demonstrates that the media display no self-respect when it's suggested they were all Trump lackeys without a conscience for the country. Where's the fight? Where's the rebuttal? Where's the disgust with such a shameless falsehood? The chin stroking just underlines that they were in Clinton's pantsuit pocket then and they remain there today.

440,L,"If you were among the brave few who bought a Tesla Roadster in 2008, you purchased your government-subsidized $100,000-plus electric car when a barrel of oil cost as much as $162 in today's dollars. ""Peak oil"" was an article of faith — as crude supplies ran out, ever-higher oil prices would destroy demand for the internal combustion engine and other fossil-fuel monstrosities.XBut now, if you're one of the 500,000 wannabe Tesla owners who, according to CEO Elon Musk, has put down a $1,000 deposit on a $35,000 Model 3, the company's new mass-market electric sedan, you're probably just as familiar with a fashionable new green conceit. Now the article of faith is ""peak demand"" for oil, the idea that electric cars will soon make oil obsolete.Funny how green logic seems to work. It doesn't matter whether there's too much demand for oil or too little — either way, oil is doomed.Sadly, for Mr. Musk and all the true believers, peak demand for oil, supposedly driven by Tesla's and other automakers' rapid rollout of electric vehicles, is mostly hype, just as peak oil was a decade ago.Yes, cost reductions in battery technology have lowered the price for electrics and will continue to do so, but the shale revolution in oil production — virtually unimagined in 2008 when Tesla debuted its first model — has cut global crude prices by more than half, making increasingly efficient conventional vehicles unbeatably cost-effective.At today's oil prices, which are still high by long-term historical standards — there is no economic incentive to pay a premium price for electric. For example, even assuming oil at $50 per barrel, a 2017 Ford Focus with a conventional engine is about $6,000 to $7,000 cheaper in terms of total cost of ownership over 15 years, compared to the all-electric version (without subsidies), or even the hybrid.To be sure, the learning curve has narrowed the manufacturer's suggested retail price for an all-electric Focus to only $14,000 more than the conventional version — while in 2012, it was about $16,000 more. That's some progress, but not much. The key is the cost of the battery, which would have to come down by half to make all-electric cars competitive with today's internal combustion engines at today's oil prices.The learning curve will continue to make electrics cheaper over time. But frackers learn too, as do designers of internal combustion engines, so oil will get cheaper and conventional engines will get better mileage. Electrics don't have to just get cheaper to compete — they have to get much cheaper.Indeed, electrics will have to get much less expensive to compete in the markets that will provide the bulk of automotive sales growth over the coming decades — developing economies where first-time buyers in an emerging middle class will prize low cost above all. In many such economies, electrics will have to compete against ultracheap, conventional Western models that can use inexpensive local fuels.And especially in China, there's a seemingly paradoxical environmental challenge. Increased electricity demand would have to be met mostly by burning coal. So in Beijing and other Chinese megalopolises where air pollution is already a serious health and quality-of-life issue, it's actually greener to power automobiles with gas-guzzling internal combustion engines.Meanwhile, in developed economies, mere cost-parity, even if it could be achieved, would be no guarantee of dominant market share gains for electrics. Consumers also care about reliability, range, charging time and availability of charging stations. As energy economist Vaclav Smil has shown, large-scale ""energy transitions"" take generations to develop the necessary infrastructure and consumer acceptance.Why then is Tesla's stock so richly valued? The market capitalization of the electric-auto innovator exceeds that of iconic U.S. automakers Ford and General Motors. But that has more to do with Ford's and GM's own weaknesses. Tesla's market cap is less than one-third of Toyota's. As to Tesla's profitability relative to any of these three rivals — well, better not to ask.Why then is the price of oil so low? It doesn't mean oil is becoming obsolete, any more than the low price of computer chips today means they are becoming obsolete. Global demand for oil is at all-time highs and rising, approaching 100 million barrels per day. The frackers, just like the semiconductor makers before them, are getting better at what they do.It's no paradox that oil demand is rising while prices are falling. It's Econ 101 — the cheaper oil gets, the more demand there should be. In fact, over the past three years, as oil prices have fallen, U.S. SUV and truck sales have increased, halting years of seemingly relentless improvement in fuel economy for new vehicles.Investors and drivers, feel free to keeping loving Tesla. Innovation is good. Competition is good. How can you not love a car so red-hot that you can put it into ""Ludicrous Mode"" at the flick of a touch screen.But absent some kind of green regulatory shock — highly unlikely under the Trump administration — there aren't going to be any compelling economic incentives for a massive switch to electric vehicles, at least not any time soon. The frackers are going to have to keep on fracking.RELATED:If Tesla Is Worth More Than GM, Why Are Taxpayers Still Subsidizing It? Federal Fuel Economy Mandates Are Deadly  New To Investing?

446,L,"For anyone who doubts the daily double standard of the news media, just look up CBS show episodes from Sunday, Sept. 10. Up first, ""Sunday Morning"" host Jane Pauley softly and sweetly served one puffball after another to Hillary Clinton for her book-tour kickoff. That evening, anchor Charlie Rose harshly lectured President Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, on ""60 Minutes.""Days in advance, CBS rushed out clips of Rose lecturing Bannon on his dissent from Catholic bishops regarding illegal aliens who entered the country as children. Rose said: ""Can I remind you, a good Catholic, that Cardinal Dolan is opposed to what's happened with DACA. Cardinal Dolan!""If anyone can remember CBS shaming anyone on the left with the pro-life worldviews of Cardinal Dolan — especially those ""good Catholics"" like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi or former Vice President Joe Biden — then someone is delusional. It has never happened.Rose lectured Bannon on Trump's supposed failure to condemn white supremacists after the events in Charlottesville. In fact, the president did condemn bigotry and hatred that Saturday, but liberals mentally censored the condemnation when he awkwardly added that there was hatred ""on all sides.""See How IBD Helps You Make Money In StocksThe anchorman introduced that phony ""many people say"" device. He insisted: ""I tell you where many people suggest it should have gone. It should have gone in terms of denouncing specifically, from the very beginning, Neo-Nazis and white supremacists and people of that political view. ... And you didn't at first instinct. In fact, you seemed to be doubling down in terms of a moral equivalency.""If anyone can take tough questions, it's a brawler like Steve Bannon. And if anyone can't handle tough questions, it's Hillary ""Safe Space"" Clinton. For all her supposed brilliance and tough-as-nails mythology, Clinton detests being challenged. She wants every interview to feel like an award ceremony. Three years ago, with her last book tour, Rose began a PBS ""interview"" with her by quoting a pro-Hillary poem by Maya Angelou.Rose's idea of a tough question was asking Clinton: ""Where did you find the strength at these difficult moments in your personal life? Whether it's losing an election — or whatever it might be. Was it people? Was it an inspiration from religion? Was it something else that gave you the courage to keep moving ahead?""To sum it up, he was asking, ""Why are you so courageous and amazing and religious?""Pauley picked up that baton on Sept. 10. She announced her mind meld regarding the candidate losing, saying, ""Hillary Clinton was supposed to make history as the first woman president of the United States."" That is precisely how a Clinton supporter would see it. A detractor would celebrate the nation dodging a bullet.Pauley tenderly asked questions like ""How are you?"" and ""Can we talk about Election Day?"" Clinton blamed her defeat on a heavy dose of ""sexism and misogyny"" and blamed Trump for exploiting ""a nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others.""Pauley facilitated: ""What you're saying is millions of white people."" Clinton agreed. ""Millions of white people, yeah,"" she said. Pauley moved on. ""And then there were the Russians,"" she said.The ""roughest"" patch came when Pauley intoned, ""But there were serious self-inflicted wounds, too."" She vaguely suggested it was time for Clinton to talk about the emails. Then, she lamented that Clinton's excuses for her decisions with emails ""never satisfied critics or the press.""The press won't even challenge Clinton on the ludicrous idea that the press heavily favored Donald Trump in 2016. No one with eyes or ears should buy that nonsense.

447,L,"The southern United States has just experienced two of the most severe storms of the century: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The economic damage wrought by these disasters may approach $150 billion. While the loss of life has been fairly low considering the severity of these storms, the human cost in terms of individual suffering can only be imagined.But if history is a guide, the economies of Houston and other communities along the Texas Gulf Coast, as well as Florida cities hit by Hurricane Irma, will rebound quickly as huge flows of private property and car insurance, charitable contributions, flood insurance, business interruption insurance, FEMA disaster aid and other federal assistance pour into the region. In retrospect, the two storms should appear as mere blips on America's economic radar screen.Already, the oil and gas industry is on the rebound. Days before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, oil and gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were shut down. Now most of them are back on stream.As a precaution, all 20 refineries along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, representing 25% of national capacity, were temporarily taken offline during Harvey. But within days of the storm's passing, 14 of the 20 were operating between 50% and 100% of capacity while the other six should be rebooted and fully operational by the end of this month. Import and export terminals in the Ports of Corpus Christi and Houston are also back in business.Similarly, the huge Colonial Pipeline that runs from Houston to Linden, New Jersey, and supplies gasoline and other refined products to more than a dozen states, was only out of service for a few days, ensuring that fuel shortages in the northeast and southeast are unlikely to occur.Yes, about a half-million gallons of gasoline leaked from a dozen storage tanks in Houston, but these spills were along the ship channel far away from the city's fresh water supply. Keep in mind that there are more than 4,500 storage tanks in the Houston area. So 99.7% of Houston's storage tanks didn't rupture. By contrast, Hurricane Katrina littered the coast with tens of thousands of drums, storage tanks, and other containers holding oil, chemicals, and other hazardous materials. This didn't happen with Harvey.Florida has no oil refineries but it does have more than 20 petroleum product storage terminals in coastal communities and 30 chemical companies. So far, it appears that none of these facilities suffered damage or leaks from Hurricane Irma. Half of Florida did lose electricity in the aftermath of Irma though, surprisingly, most of Houston didn't lose power — probably because Harvey was mainly about flooding and not wind.There have been a handful of benzene leaks detected at Houston area refineries, and one small chemical plant that lost power experienced several explosions. But overall, the refining and petrochemical industries along the Gulf Coast, as well as pipelines and offshore production platforms, proved to be extraordinarily resilient as more than 50 inches of rain inundated Houston and Beaumont-Port Arthur over four days.Another testimony to the integrity of America's energy supply chain is that while the national average gasoline price jumped about 30 cents a gallon between Aug. 28 and Sept. 7, it started declining even as Hurricane Irma was making landfall in Florida and should soon be back to ""prestorm"" levels.The untold story is that after Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and Ike the energy industry spent billions upgrading their facilities along the Gulf Coast so they could withstand future catastrophic storms. With huge investments in new chemical plants, refinery expansions, industrial facilities and export terminals currently underway in Texas and Louisiana, even more resources will be expended by industry and public entities to protect this infrastructure, so critical to America's economic prosperity, from future natural disasters.

454,L,"Stocks kept to a mostly bullish script Wednesday with the major indexes edging higher and posting new all-time highs in afternoon trading. Apple (AAPL), one of the best-performing megacap stocks this year, continued to trade quietly after bouncing off last week's low of 149.16.XAt 153.40, down less than 0.8%, Apple is still moderately below its 50-day moving average and a few points below an Aug. 2 breakout point at 156.75 from a second-stage flat-base pattern.Continued sideways movement would boost the prospects of a new base forming next to the prior flat base. A flat base must be a minimum five weeks in length, a cup base a minimum six weeks.Apple has already risen as much as 42% since Jan. 1 and is holding on to a 29% advance since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming-base pattern on Jan. 6-9. That first-stage base was a beautiful cup-with-handle base that offered a prime buy point at 118.12, 10 cents above the handle's intraday high.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average harbored gains of nearly 0.1%. Volume was running slightly higher on the Nasdaq and a touch lighter on the NYSE as of 2:45 p.m. ET vs. the same time on Tuesday.The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped nearly 0.4% and is poised to end an eight-day winning streak. The 600 has gained as much as 12.9% since mid-August.Shopify (SHOP) got rocked by sellers following negative comments from short selling-focused research firm Citron, falling more than 10% to 104.86. Volume was heavy at nearly 14 million shares, well above the stock's 50-day average volume of 1.7 million shares.Certainly, gains have been tremendous since the expert in cloud-based e-commerce platforms for small and medium businesses broke out of a six-week flat base at 45.55 in early January. Gains have grown to as much as 172%. If the stock sharply undercuts the 50-day moving average and fails to rebound, such action would constitute a sell signal for holders who wish to book some profits.A stock that, after making a tremendous price run, falls sharply in the heaviest turnover since the breakout also is showing a change in character that warrants at least some selling to lock in gains.However, the move on Wednesday is not triggering any short-selling signals.IBD's research, as encapsulated by the monthly Short Side column, has found that the best time to sell a former big winner is when the stock has either formed a head and shoulders pattern, or failed miserably following the breakout from a late-stage base.Shopify fits neither of these profiles.In a head-and-shoulders pattern, a stock will fall deeply from its 52-week or all-time high, then make two or three attempts to rally back above the 50-day or 10-week moving average. Such rebounds reflect the existence of some investors who still are bullish in the stock. But after these rallies falter, a drop through the 50-day line in heavy volume would signal the correct time to sell short. The overall pattern typically lasts five to seven months.Also notice how Shopify has tested its 50-day moving average several times in recent months. Watch to see this week if the stock can finish above either its 50-day line or the 10-week moving average, as seen in a weekly chart.Returning to Apple, while the media has reported concern over the initial uptake of the latest generation of iPhones, the company's biggest revenue generator today, Wall Street has actually raised its full-year profit forecasts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now see earnings rising 8% to $9.01 a share in fiscal 2017, which ended in September, and accelerating 22% higher to $11.03 a share in FY 2018.The company says it is on track to double its services-related revenue by 2020.IBD's TAKE: Apple is not the only company in big-cap-land that is showing excellent gains this year. Use IBD Big Cap 20 to bulk up your knowledge of highly rated large-cap firms in terms of fundamentals, technicals and quality of institutional sponsorship. In the IBD Weekly, each mini weekly chart on the Big Cap 20, as well as the IBD 50, carries a succinct analysis of what the stock is actually doing today and where the key buy and sell points are.Other key leaders to watch:Square (SQ), up a seventh straight day as shares in the digital payments platform rose another 0.9% to 30.21 and got further extended past a 28.07 buy point in a cuplike base.Square was briefly featured in IBD Leaderboard last month.The proper buy zone goes up to 29.47, 5% past the 28.07 proper entry. The recent new base features a shallow decline of just 13.4%, meaning that it also fits the depth parameter of a flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that are highly useful for growth investors.Square, whose products and data analytics are popular among mobile businesses and brick-and-mortar retail stores, has notched a profit for five straight quarters amid revenue gains of 41%, 32%, 21%, 22% and 26% over the same time frame.The Street sees profit surging 500% to 24 cents a share this year and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.\Homebuilders continue to do well. The Building sector is ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The rankings are based on relative price performance over the medium and long term.LGI Homes (LGIH) of Texas is resuming its breakout, gaining 3% to 50.54 and surpassing its 50.05 cup-base buy point in fast turnover.Watch to see if the small cap can exceed the turnover of 431,000 shares seen on Monday, when the fast-growing builder of entry-level single-family homes first attempted to clear the cup.Notice, too, that the cup features no handle. As noted in this Investor's Corner column, some excellent stocks can still blast out to big gains on a cup base even without forming a handle (the last shakeout as uncommitted holders sell their shares, eager to exit a stock, right before a potential breakout).Analysts expect LGI to post a 42% increase in third-quarter earnings to $1.22 a share. In the year-ago quarter, earnings rose 13%.RELATED:How To Sell Stocks Short: The Latest In The Short Side How To Make Money In Stocks: How Long Should You Hold Your Winners?Stocks To Buy: Read Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Find Excellent Stocks: Inside IBD Sector Leaders

463,L,"KB Home (KBH) topped expectations late Thursday, but the homebuilder has been making headlines over the last week, not likely for the reasons it wants, amid an ongoing feud between KB Home CEO Jeffrey Mezger and comedian Kathy Griffin.X Estimates: Profits seen rising 12% to 47 cents a share on 23% revenue growth to $1.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Per-share earnings of 51 cents per diluted share on revenue of $1.14 billion.Stock: Shares rose late after climbing 2.8% to 22.22 on the stock market today, retaking their key 50-day line as the stock heads toward a 24.47 buy point. Scandal or no, shares have been rising steadily over the last week, staging a six-session win streak.Other builder stocks are in or near buy range. D.R. Horton (DHI) re-entered buying territory earlier this week after breaking out Sept. 12. Toll Bros. (TOL) edged up 1.8% to 40.98 Thursday, closing in on a 41.17 buy point from a flat base. LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied 3.6% to 47.86, clearing an entry of 46.99 from a cup-with-handle base.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Mezger's feud with Griffin went public after the Huffington Post published audio of the KB Home chief executive going on a slur-filled tirade against his next-door neighbor. The board of KB Home slashed his bonus by 25% and said in a regulatory filing that ""if in the future there is any similar incident, he will be dismissed.""Homebuilders have also been buffeted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which sent sales of new homes unexpectedly lower last month.D.R. Horton also has said it sees an 85% backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter, down from a prior range of 88% to 90%, citing delays caused by hurricanes.Lennar (LEN) said Irma damage was ""mild"" but predicted it would delay about 700 deliveries from the Q4 of 2017 into the following fiscal year. Harvey impacted about 120 new orders and deliveries in Q3 and is projected to impact approximately 130 deliveries in Q4.RELATED:KB Home's CEO Has Been Warned: He'll Be Fired For Doing This AgainNew-Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall, But These 3 Builders Are Near BuysD.R.

466,L,"For decades, liberal journalists have often tried to discredit conservative protest movements, from the tea party to the pro-lifers, by smearing them with violent extremists. So it's fascinating to read liberal Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan warn on Sept. 4 against tarring the anti-Trump ""resistance"" with an antifa brush. The headline read ""Quick to Vilify, But Slow to Explain It.""Sullivan claimed that all most people know about antifa, the far-left-leaning militant groups, is what they've heard from President Trump and what they've guessed from video of ""club-wielding protesters shown endlessly on TV."" This leads them to think antifa members are ""the left-wing equivalent of neo-Nazis."" Sullivan said, ""That's not only untrue, but it has the effect of tarring everyone who protests Trump, as well as those who peacefully march for climate-change awareness or rally against hate-mongering speakers.""She complained that the term ""antifa"" has been ""quickly weaponized"" and quoted leftist writer Paul Blest to claim that antifa's level of violence is nearly nonexistent next to the extremist right. Blest said, ""To pretend that the alt-right and Antifa are comparable is like equating the danger of playing Russian roulette with taking a walk.""Try asking someone beaten half to death by antifa thugs whether it felt like a walk in the park.In Sullivan's mind, the so-called alt-right has faced an easy road. She bizarrely claimed that ""a prettied-up celebrity status accrued to white-nationalist leader Richard Spencer, who was profiled everywhere with flattering photos and reasonable-sounding quotes."" But she didn't provide a single example of a media outlet, liberal or conservative, flattering Spencer with ""prettied-up celebrity status"" ... because it didn't happen.IBD Investor Education: How To Invest In Stocks: Start With A Simple RoutineABC's interviews of Spencer were described on-screen with words like ""Hate Among Us"" and ""Confronting Hate."" He openly talked about an approaching race war, which is not very ""reasonable-sounding."" Sullivan's own Washington Post described him with headlines like ""Richard Spencer's Vision: Apartheid in America"" and ""Six Angry Men and Their Long Roads of Hate.""Sullivan also relayed questionable numbers from the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL. She said: ""Right-wing extremists committed 74% of the 372 politically motivated murders recorded in the United States between 2007 and 2016. Left-wing extremists committed less than 2%.""Of course, most conservatives don't consider the Hitler-adoring National Socialist extremists to be right-wing. Worse yet, Sullivan was wrong to claim that the ADL only counted ""politically motivated"" murders. Its ""Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2016"" report explicitly stated that it counted all murders by the extremists it identified, including ""non-ideological"" murders in the midst of  ""gang-related and traditional criminal activity.""Sullivan also stated, ""Mainstream news organizations and liberal politicians are quick to criticize antifa — doing so vehemently has become a badge of honor — but less quick to explain the group's ideology, tactics or goals."" To her chagrin, Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the Washington Post editorial board are coming around to the idea of properly vilifying antifa as a violent fringe.Sullivan lamented that antifa theorist Mark Bray, a professor at Dartmouth College, was ""publicly slapped back by his university president."" She lectured reporters: ""The best thing journalists can do is to relentlessly explain the beliefs, scope and scale of antifa, and to resist conflating it with liberal groups."" NBC's Chuck Todd has already put Bray on air twice to promote antifa's explicit endorsement of violence. And NPR's talk show ""1A"" gave Bray an hourlong platform to explain it.Sullivan and Todd look especially odd because the liberal media have protested so harshly against President Trump denouncing journalists for fake news. Antifa thugs have repeatedly beaten or threatened journalists and regular citizens on the street who dare to capture them on tape. Why, then, must they not be ""vilified""?RELATED:Trump's Approval Rating Climbs After 'Terrible' August; Most Say Confederate Should Remain -- IBD/TIPP PollThe Overreaction to Charlottesville Is Just What White Supremacists WantCharlottesville And Double Standards

472,L,"The nation's eyes are fixated on dramatic flooding in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, where the death toll (so far) is thankfully small compared to flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The government response on all levels seems to be fairly effective, and unlike with Katrina, the press coverage hasn't been dominated by accusations of racism or inhumanity in the rescue effort.There's one obvious exception: cartoonists for the left. Politico tweeted an image by radical artist Matt Wuerker in which he mocks Christian wackos wearing Confederate flag shirts. A man being rescued from his rooftop declares: ""Angels! Sent by God!"" A Coast Guard pilot is shown correcting him. ""Er, actually Coast Guard ... sent by the government,"" he says.After mocking the victims still suffering from a hurricane as stupid religious folks, Wuerker tried to dig himself out of a hole on Twitter. He lamented: ""Just trying to point out times like this we're lucky to have rescue services. Don't see how this takes away from private individuals heroism."" Then he added: ""Respectfully — it's making fun of the Secessionist movement. Not at all aimed at all Texans."" Politico soon deleted its promotional tweet, but not the cartoon.A poll taken in 2016 (by Democrat pollsters) showed that 59% of Texans opposed secession, and only 26% expressed support. Wuerker claimed that his job is to prod people into considering ""the ironies and subtleties of the world we live in,"" but cartoons like this aren't ironic or subtle. They're ham-fisted and ignorant.Wuerker also felt it was safe to mock conservatives. ""Times like this it's ironic to say that the government is the enemy,"" he said. It's not conservatives who have protested the front-line heroes of local government but leftist street agitators who have endlessly denigrated the police as racist child killers.Then there's the scabrous French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo, whose latest cover shows a bunch of Nazi flags mostly underwater and a few white hands sticking out of the water in the ""Heil Hitler"" salute. The cover text in French translates to ""God Exists! He Drowned All Neo-Nazis of Texas!"" The cartoon was drawn by Laurent Sourisseau, alias ""Riss,"" who was wounded in the 2015 Islamic terror attack on the magazine's Paris offices in which a dozen were killed.This is just another reason why decent, God-fearing Americans should have resisted the free speech slogan/hashtag ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie."" These atheists have a right to their satire, but it overflows with vicious hatred and stereotyping. In 2012, it slammed Catholic protests of gay marriage with a cover that showed God being sodomized by Jesus (complete with a crown of thorns) and a triangle with an eye representing the Holy Spirit ""bringing up the rear"" of Christ.These cartoonists somehow assume that Texas is 100% Republican and/or neo-Nazi. Harris County, in which Houston serves as county seat, voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, 54% to 41%. Houston has a fairly large Jewish population (more than 45,000). A 2010 racial breakdown from the U.S. Census Bureau shows only 50.5% are white, 43.8% are Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 23.7% are black. The Houston area is represented in the House of Representatives by six Republicans and three Democrats (two of them black).But to liberal elites, all Texans are somehow bigoted white Christian males. Even a hurricane can't restrain their rage about their satirical targets having any power in America. Cartoons like these strongly underline why so many Americans find that the secular-progressive media are either tone-deaf or blatantly hostile toward what (and Who) they hold dear.

474,L,"As Hillary Clinton prepares to promote her new book on her 2016 election loss, simply titled ""What Happened,"" the rest of us prepare to hear every excuse about how her allegedly inevitable juggernaut landed in a ditch. The most implausible villain in this scenario is the liberal media; somehow they were disloyal to the Clintons and ""played by the Republicans.""Hillary die-hards are promoting a new report from Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society that insists the press was remarkably unfair to her campaign. Former Clinton aide Peter Daou tweeted out the study and insisted it should ""result in mass apologies from the media.""The study offered this key finding: ""Donald Trump succeeded in shaping the election agenda. Coverage of Trump overwhelmingly outperformed coverage of Clinton. Clinton's coverage was focused on scandals, while Trump's coverage focused on his core issues. ... Immigration and Muslims/Islam were the two most widely covered substantive issues of the campaign.""No one could plausibly argue that the media was nicer to Trump than they were to Hillary Clinton, or that they treated his policy proposals with more respect. They dubbed Trump's comments on immigration and Islam as horribly scandalous, while they dismissed Clinton's scandals like the private email server as a ""stupid issue"" (as John Dickerson of CBS said).To assess this study's claims, there are fundamental questions: What is the time frame of this research? How is the press defined?The study period began on May 1, 2015, and went through Election Day. So it's plausible that the media's horror about Trump's comments on Mexican and Muslim immigration were a dominant topic. For most of the early months, Clinton's campaign avoided the press and tried to center her race on her qualities rather than her policies — focusing on her competence and experience and suggesting that Trump had neither.When most people hear the term ""the press,"" they think of the traditional press, the so-called objective media outlets. But this Harvard study defined the press as including a bunch of ""hyperpartisan"" sites, from Breitbart on the right to the Daily Kos on the left. It evaluated social media, studying the most shared stories of the campaign. That might be interesting, but it's not a study of press coverage as most people understand it.MSNBC host Ari Melber summarized the study's finding on media consumption by saying: ""Clinton supporters shared actual news stories from news outlets that they liked. And Trump supporters shared opinion pieces from partisan and propaganda outlets. So, Clinton's top sources were journalistic — the New York Times, Washington Post, and Politico, while Trump supporters, according to this massive amount of data, chose partisan outlets like The Daily Caller and Breitbart.""Try not to laugh at the idea that the New York Times and the Washington Post were nonpartisan outlets with no animus against Trump and no favoritism toward Clinton.But here's where we scream ""Buyer beware"" on these studies of campaign bias. Did the Harvard researchers actually read the contents of each story? No. They offered ""content analysis using automated tools."" They had Media Cloud software scan sentences ... because their sample was literally millions of stories. This is as nebulous as counting the number of Google mentions of a topic to say whether it was overcovered or undercovered. At least another Harvard outfit, the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, issues studies ""conducted by trained full-time employees who visually evaluate the content.""Clinton can't blame the liberal media for her defeat. It's not fair to blame journalists for sharing her blindness: She can't see how half the country dismisses them as arrogant elitists who won't let ""deplorables"" have any voice in how America evolves.

At 6472, the tech-rich index at one point looked poised to post an all-time closing high.Meanwhile, small-cap indexes were faring especially well as banking shares of virtually all stripes also rallied ahead of details from President Trump's tax cut proposal, expected later today during a speech in Indianapolis.Late on Tuesday, some of the tax cut plans were previewed among members of Congress and included a slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, a cut of the top individual income tax rate of 39.6%, a doubling of standard deductions for filing tax returns, and higher child tax credits.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and notched a new all-time high before easing a bit. The large-cap benchmark is getting weighed down a bit by losses in utility, food, drugstore chain, gold mining and other defensive-oriented industry groups.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up nearly 0.3%, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least seven of the 30 components in the index, including Goldman Sachs (GS) (still forming a saucer-type base), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (trying to overcome upside resistance near 94) and McDonald's (MCD) (which triggered a sell signal with a sharp break of the 50-day moving average near 157).The small-cap S&P 600 surged 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. Strength in the auto, airline, trucking and shipping sectors held up, as the Dow Jones transportation average rallied more than 0.6%.The Dow utilities are off 1.2% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond soared to 2.30%, the highest in weeks.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday, a bullish sign for the market. All of the major indexes are also trading near all-time highs.Going back to Apple, if the megacap tech cannot quickly rebound back above its latest buy point of 156.75, expect the stock to take more time in forming a potential new base. Also, watch to see if its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which has fallen to a poor grade of E on a scale of A (superior accumulation) to E (heavy selling), can improve.Apple is seeing a slow-yet-steady pickup in the top line, a critical factor in its future stock potential. Revenue rose 3% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in December 2016, ending a three-quarter slump, then grew 5% and 7% in the next two quarters.The Street sees Apple's revenue climbing at a faster rate again, up 9% to $50.93 billion in Q4 of this current fiscal year, then 11% in Q1 of fiscal 2018 to $86.71 billion.Within the semiconductor sector, Nvidia (NVDA) expanded its gains, rising more than 2% to 175.89 in above-average turnover. Shares of the expert in graphics processors and chips for artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles backtracked after surpassing a new flat-base buy point at 174.66 a few weeks ago, but are now back above that proper entry.Sometimes a high-quality stock such as Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, needs more than one attempt to break out successfully. And keep in mind that the big-cap tech play has already boomed more than 420% from a 33.16 cup-with-handle breakout back in March 2016, before the latest base formed.Another concern is how Wall Street will react to the inevitable slowdown in earnings and revenue growth in the next few quarters. From Q3 (ended in October) of fiscal 2017 to Q2 (ended in July) in the current fiscal year, Nvidia's EPS growth has been astonishing, rising 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124% on an adjusted basis, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.When earnings grow that fast, it's very hard to keep up such a hot pace.Revenue at Nvidia, which also makes semiconductors for data centers, jumped 24%, 54%, 55%, 48% and 56% vs. year-ago levels over the same five-quarter span.Nvidia benefits from being in a strong chip sector, which through Tuesday's close ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors as seen in IBD's stock research tables. The 33 sectors are ranked every day in terms of a blend of mid- to long-term price performance.IBD's chip sector is up 26.8% since Jan. 1, slamming the 11.5% gain of the S&P 500.Other notable chip companies with excellent fundamentals and strong price action include Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT), ASML (ASML) (98 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup) of the Netherlands, wafer fabrication titan Applied Materials (AMAT) and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX).Applied Materials stretched its gain to more than 7% to 49.16, quickly getting back above a 47.69 early buy point within a cuplike base. Shares remain in buy range up to 50.07.Watch to see if Applied Materials' volume runs well above the 50-day average by day's end. With less than a half hour to go in the session, turnover is running nicely at a pace 76% above its 50-day average. Among big-cap names, it's preferable to see volume bulge at least 40% higher than normal at the breakout or soon after. Applied has 1.07 billion shares outstanding and a $51.9 billion market value.Applied's base is later stage; the rally got going with a breakout from a bottoming-base pattern at 21.77 in May 2016, and that base was first stage. Keep in mind, though, that a select number of companies with truly outstanding fundamentals, the best products and services, and top management are capable of staging nice gains from third-, fourth- and even fifth-stage bases.Applied is expected to grow fiscal 2017 earnings 83% to $3.20 a share, extending three years of increases. In fiscal 2018, which ends in October next year, EPS growth is seen slowing sharply, up 12% at $3.60 a share. However, analysts' estimates for a full year out are often conservative.Ultra Clean of Hayward, Calif., rallied more than 9% to 29.41 in fast turnover. Shares in the small-cap name are extended past a new cup buy point at 26.30. The proper buy zone extends up to 27.62. It's especially important to buy chip stocks within the right price zone, no more than 5% above a proper entry, because they tend to swing more quickly and more violently than the average company on Wall Street.Buying a stock that's too far extended in price can force a new investor to exit a stock with a sharp loss during a normal price pullback.Lithography systems expert ASML rose 2.9% to 167.61 in brisk trading, and has now rallied 21% following a July breakout past a 137.37 buy point in an eight-week flat base.In a good flat base, the correction from head to toe should not exceed 15%. In ASML's case, the stock dipped from 137.27 on May 16 to 126.03 on June 12, a mere 8.2%. Notice, too, how the megacap tech firm had a solid prior uptrend before sculpting the new base.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to a breakout from a solid base, including the cup with handle, is to see a prior uptrend of 30% or more before a stock forms its next base. Read this Investor's Corner column to become more acquainted with using charts to get an edge on Wall Street and improve your market timing in both stocks and the major indexes.Microchip Technology (MCHP), currently in IBD's Big Cap 20 screen, rose 1.2% to 88.68 and is in buy range from an 86.04 handle entry in a shallow cup.The Chandler, Ariz., expert in flash memory and microcontrollers for multiple markets has shown steady profit growth since fiscal 2014 (ended in March that year). Earnings have jumped from $2.45 a share in FY 2014 to $3.99 in FY 2017. In the current fiscal 2018, analysts see earnings rising another 32% to $5.27 a share.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Why Apple's Rally Isn't Over YetThe Big Picture: Will The Nasdaq's Lead Diminish?How To Trade Stocks: Why A Flat Base And Square Box Represent Bullish MovementHow To Spot Major Market Tops: Here Is The Easy Way

480,L,"New-home sales unexpectedly fell in August while supply surged as hurricanes take their toll on normal sales activity in Texas and much of the South. But shares of most homebuilders rallied Tuesday morning, with D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) all close to buy points.Sales of single-family new-home sales fell 3.4% to an annual rate of 560,000, after July was revised up slightly to a 580,000 pace, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a rise to 583,000. The supply of homes at the current sales pace rose to 6.1 months, the highest since July 2014. Some 284,000 new homes were on the block, the most since May 2009, at the tail end of the last recession. Sales fell 4.7% in the South.The storms and the aftermath will likely affect sales and construction for several months.D.R. Horton rose 1% to 37.44 in the stock market today, after reaching 37.61 intraday and briefly topping a 37.54 buy point. D.R. Horton cleared that entry earlier this month but pulled back, finding support just above its 50-day moving average. D.R. Horton lowered guidance on Monday due to the recent hurricanes.Toll Bros. advanced 1 cent to 40.22. Shares of the entry-luxury builder are closing in on a 41.17 buy point.LGI Homes advanced 1.1% to 46.07. As of Tuesday's close, LGI Homes has a proper handle with the minimum five days. That gives the stock a lower entry of 46.99.Meanwhile, Home Depot (HD), which has gotten a lift from prehurricane preparations and post-hurricane repair, edged up 0.1% to 161.26. Home Depot nudged past a 160.96 entry on Monday, but in light volume.RELATED:D.R.

Richardo Rossello that ""we are with you and the people of Puerto Rico. Stay safe! #PR Strong.""And while Trump might not have tweeted about Puerto Rico since then, the U.S. government has hardly been sitting idly by.A short list of what FEMA, the Coast Guard, the Department of Defense and other government agencies have been busy doing there:But what's really galling about the attacks on Trump for his nontweeting about Puerto Rico is that the mainstream press was hardly interested in the island's plight until they found a way to use it to attack Trump.The New York Times had nothing about Puerto Rico on the front page of its Sunday edition. Monday's front page carried only a brief at the bottom, which was headlined: ""Harvest Ruined in Puerto Rico.""

482,L,"Shares of OLED display and lighting specialist Universal Display (OLED) climbed to a record high on Tuesday after getting a positive report from investment bank Goldman Sachs.Universal Display stock gained 4% to close at 142.20 on the stock market today. In intraday trading, the stock hit an all-time high of 145.30.XGoldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee reiterated his buy rating on the stock and raised his 12-month price target to 161 from 150.Lee believes Universal Display is close to commercializing blue phosphorescent OLED emitter materials for displays, joining the red, green and yellow materials it already sells.The blue OLED materials could be a ""game-changer"" for Universal Display, Lee said.""Our analysis suggests blue could add 16% to 66% to out-year EPS (earnings per share), which at current P/Es (price/earnings ratio) implies a stock worth as much as $178 to $254 per share,"" Lee said.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display is currently ranked No. 2 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Universal Display is a key supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting. Its customers include OLED display makers like Samsung and LG Display (LPL). OLED displays are increasingly being used in smartphones, including Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone X.""Looking ahead, we believe the potential addition of blue materials to Universal Display's product portfolio could more than double its revenue content per smartphone and drive yet another step-function in the company's growth rate in the medium to long term,"" Lee said.Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are seen as superior to liquid crystal display (LCD) screens in terms of color reproduction, contrast ratio, refresh rate and power efficiency.RELATED:Dolby, Universal Display Boosted By New Apple iPhonesApple iPhone 8 Seen Lifting Universal Display Sales, EarningsUniversal Display Stock Soars On Bullish Analyst Report

488,L,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The Air Force could use a light-attack plane in the fight against the Islamic State, but only after air superiority is assured, a top Air Force commander said.  XAs the Air Force continues to buy stealthy Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s, it's also looking at a cheaper option of 300 light-attack aircraft to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.But Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command, said ""air superiority is job one — that affords you a lot of options.""Once air superiority is assured, then a light-attack aircraft can be used.""I think the light attack would be able to provide me a lot of options, particularly if you're able to move closer to the forward line of the troops, provide the persistence that this type of platform will provide,"" he said at the Air Force Association's annual conference Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Air Force conducted an experiment with four planes over the summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and evaluated Textron's (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine, the A-29 Super Tucano from Sierra Nevada Corp. and Embraer (ERJ), and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL).The service hasn't made a final decision if the experiment will become a future program.Lockheed shares weren't active yet in premarket trading on the stock market today.

492,L,"ESPN has been working hard for several years to establish itself as just another sermonizing member of the liberal media, most audaciously by hailing Caitlyn Jenner with an award for ""courage"" in 2015 for facing down such tortures as the disrespectful use of ""incorrect pronouns."" Soldiers who lost their lives in combat hadn't a fraction of Jenner's bravery, according to their judgment.Now, ESPN has shown its true colors, which is to say: The people there are idiots. In the wake of the media's Charlottesville feeding frenzy, it reassigned a college football announcer named Robert Lee away from covering the University of Virginia football game against William and Mary on Sept. 2. Even liberal sports junkies like NBC's Chuck Todd tweeted: ""This is stupid. Sorry. Someone's PR team is way too sensitive."" As everyone now knows, Robert Lee is Asian-American.When the story broke, some suggested it was too obviously brain dead to be authentic. Surely, it was a parody.Then, ESPN made it even better by defending this moronic decision. An executive put out a statement to New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributor Yashar Ali that said: ""This wasn't about offending anyone. It was about the reasonable possibility that because of his name he would be subjected to memes and jokes and who knows what else. ... No politically correct efforts. No race issues. Just trying to be supportive of a young guy who felt it best to avoid the potential zoo.""The ""potential zoo"" here is all in the fevered brains of the ESPN brass. When we watch college football games, we rarely know the names of the announcers. And we care about knowing even less. But what if the public were to know? Stop the presses! This just shows how hypersensitive they are to racial issues. As the story broke, longtime ESPN anchor Bob Ley tweeted, ""Rather worried my employee ID/pass may not admit me in the AM."" A perfect response.Some liberals suggested this doesn't show ESPN is liberal. It shows ESPN is a ""cynical corporation"" trying to distance itself from any hint of a political controversy in social media. But the outcomes are the same. The left is dictating its terms to another national network.Then, ESPN made it better still. Its president, John Skipper, declared that the network's ""good intentions"" were ""hijacked"" by the ""personal agenda"" of Clay Travis, who broke the story for Fox Sports.So Fox Sports is to blame for ESPN's nuttiness. On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Travis shot back, saying: ""This is the problem with ESPN and their leadership. They talk to us like we're a bunch of idiots and imbeciles, and sell crap. ... This is not true.""College football will go on, but what lingers is the notion that sports is almost a secondary matter at ESPN. The idea that sports is an escape from politics is disparaged as almost criminal in the hyperventilating Trump Era. Demonstrating you are ""woke"" — actively marching on the ""right side of history"" — is the path to job security. On the other hand, expressing conservative views on air or on social media gets you canned, as proven by a straight line from Rush Limbaugh to Mike Ditka to Curt Schilling to Britt McHenry.Taking ESPN to the left can't look like a wise strategy, as the network's subscriber base has declined from a peak of 100 million households in 2011 to less than 87 million now. But other liberal networks have shown that their business imperatives are less important than audaciously demonstrating their ""courage"" and commitment to the ""social justice warriors.""

494,L,"WASHINGTON — At this shank end of a summer that a calmer America someday will remember with embarrassment, you must remember this: In the population of 325 million, a small sliver crouches on the wilder shores of politics, another sliver lives in the dark forest of mental disorder, and there is a substantial overlap between these slivers.At most moments, 312 million are not listening to excitable broadcasters making mountains of significance out of molehills of political effluvia.Still, after a season of dangerous talk about responding to idiotic talk by abridging First Amendment protections, Americans should consider how, if at all, to respond to ""cheap speech.""That phrase was coined 22 years ago by Eugene Volokh of UCLA Law School. Writing in The Yale Law Journal (""Cheap Speech and What It Will Do"") at the dawn of the internet, he said that new information technologies were about to ""dramatically reduce the costs of distributing speech,"" and that this would produce a ""much more democratic and diverse"" social environment.Power would drain from ""intermediaries"" (publishers, book and music store owners, etc.) but this might take a toll on ""social and cultural cohesion.""Volokh anticipated today's a la carte world of instant and inexpensive electronic distributions of only such content as pleases particular individuals. Each person can craft delivery of what MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte called (in his 1995 book ""Being Digital"") a ""Daily Me.""In 1995, Volokh said that ""letting a user configure his own mix of materials"" can cause social problems: customization breeds confirmation bias — close-minded people who cocoon themselves in a cloud of only congenial information. This exacerbates political polarization by reducing ""shared cultural referents"" and ""common knowledge about current events.""Technologies that radically reduce intermediaries and other barriers to entry into society's conversation mean that ignorance, incompetence and intellectual sociopathy are no longer barriers. One result is a miasma of distrust of all public speech.Although Volokh leans libertarian, what he foresaw — ""the demassification of the mass media"" — led him to conclude: ""The law of speech is premised on certain (often unspoken) assumptions about the way the speech market operates. If these assumptions aren't valid for new technologies, the law may have to evolve to reflect the changes.""He warned about what has come about, odious groups cheaply disseminating their views to thousands of the likeminded. Nevertheless, he stressed the danger of letting ""government intervene when it thinks it has found 'market failure.'""Now, Richard L. Hasen of the University of California, Irvine offers a commentary on Volokh, ""Cheap Speech and What It Has Done (to American Democracy),"" forthcoming in the First Amendment Law Review.Hasen, no libertarian, supports campaign-spending regulations whereby government limits the quantity of campaign speech that can be disseminated. Given, however, that ""in place of media scarcity, we now have a media firehose,"" such regulations are of diminished importance. As, Hasen says, using the internet to tap small donors has ""a democratizing and equalizing effect.""But, he correctly says, cheap speech is reducing the relevance of political parties and newspapers as intermediaries between candidates and voters, which empowers demagogues. Voters are directly delivered falsehoods such as the 2016 story of Pope Francis' endorsement of Donald Trump, which Hasen says ""had 960,000 Facebook engagements.""He cites a study reporting approximately three times more pro-Trump than pro-Hillary Clinton fake news stories, with the former having four times more Facebook shares than the latter.Hasen says that during the 2016 election, digital advertising revenue reached $1.4 billion, a 789% increase over the 2012 campaign, with Facebook and Google receiving 85% of it. Courts have rejected the idea of government bodies declaring campaign statements lies; besides, as Hasen delicately says, this is ""an era of demagoguery and disinformation emanating from the highest levels of government.""But because ""counterspeech"" might be insufficient ""to deal with the flood of bot-driven fake news,"" Hasen thinks courts should not construe the First Amendment as prohibiting laws requiring ""social media and search companies such as Facebook and Google to provide certain information to let consumers judge the veracity of posted materials.""Hasen errs. Such laws, written by incumbent legislators, inevitably will be infected with partisanship. Also, his progressive faith in the fiction of disinterested government causes him to propose ""government subsidizing investigative journalism"" — putting investigators of government on its payroll.The most urgent debate concerns the First Amendment implications of regulating foreign money that is insinuated into campaigns. This debate will commence when Robert Mueller reports.

495,L,"The National Football League's preseason is underway, and national anthem-hating quarterback Colin Kaepernick still doesn't have an NFL job. One can easily identify the liberal journalists by their anguish over this so-called injustice. You can also identify them by their dishonest arguments.Washington Post sports columnist Jerry Brewer pulled out a very large straw man on Aug. 17 in a column headlined ""Days of Docile Black Athlete Have Ended. Get Used to It."" He doubled down in the text, saying: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, sports fans, but the days of the docile black athlete are over. This isn't a time to stick to sports. This isn't a time to be afraid because Kaepernick has been blackballed."" To argue that Kaepernick's critics want ""docile blacks"" is character assassination.Then, Brewer added that the national anthem lasts about two minutes, as does an interview after the game about that anti-American kneeling stunt. He spewed: ""If you think that's too much of a distraction from sports — the ultimate distraction — you're living an awfully petty life. I'm sorry you didn't get to put extra sprinkles on your ice cream, but there are more important matters.""Brewer surely knows that Kaepernick's antics didn't cause two minutes of liberal concern or conservative outrage. We've had an entire summer of ESPN and other liberal sports pundits like Brewer demanding that Kaepernick somehow has an inalienable right to a job in the NFL after his antics.Most of these liberals impose their own righteousness about America's ""systematic racism"" without acknowledging that Kaepernick went beyond this quiet pregame stance. They ignore that he wore socks in training camp featuring pigs with police hats on them. They ignore that he wore a T-shirt with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro on it as he supposedly advocated for freedom of speech.When challenged by Cuban exile Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald about the T-shirt, Kaepernick proclaimed that communist Cuba was better than America. He said, ""One thing that Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here, even though we're fully capable of doing that.""Salguero called that out as false, as phony as the Castros winning 100% of the vote. When he told the quarterback that Castro's regime broke up families (including his own) as they sought to escape, Kaepernick attacked America again. ""We do break up families here,"" he said. ""That's what mass incarceration is. That was the foundation of slavery, so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of Native Americans.""It's not a matter of ""extra sprinkles on our ice cream"" to smear the police as porcine, racist killers and smear America as founded not on liberty and justice but on slavery and genocide.But Brewer, that professor of logic, thinks that Kaepernick's complete evisceration of America is somehow what makes this country ... great? He said: ""But if America is still America — beautiful despite some ugly features, slow to evolve but persistent, a compassionate democracy — history will judge Kaepernick ultimately not as a rogue and defiant objector, but a man ahead of this time who helped spur an important athlete revolution.""What liberal journalists are demanding here is that every famous person in front of a microphone exploit that platform to call for a leftist revolution. Athletes, actors, musicians, reality TV stars and everyone else should always be shilling against the horrid country that America was — and presently is under the Republicans. ""History"" (always equated with liberalism) will grade them as heroes ahead of their time.

496,L,"Semiconductors are finding their way into everything in modern life, from cellphones to air conditioners to rice cookers — and the need to make those chips ever smaller is never ending.XThat's where ASML Holdings (ASML) comes in. As electronic devices become more ubiquitous, increase in complexity and get thinner, companies like Intel (INTC) and Samsung need machines that can meet evolving needs. Back in the 1960s, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted the number of transistors on each chip will double every 18 to 24 months, a phenomenon known as Moore's Law.Netherlands-based ASML produces photolithography machines that can print microscopic features on chips. While it has a wide variety of products in the chip lithography space, it's invested over $7 billion in developing its Extreme Ultraviolet Lithograph (EUV) machines that use a high-frequency light to print more circuits on silicon wafers.""These will enable Moore's Law to continue, where the number of chips increase and cost goes down every 18 to 24 months,"" said Jagadish Iyer, senior analyst at Summit Redstone Partners.Of ASML's nearly $4.8 billion in sales, its EUV division only accounted for $300 million, but analysts expect EUV machines to be the next major development in chipmaking and see a market eventually worth billions of dollars. Global sales of semiconductors were up 24% in July year-over-year for a total of $33.6 billion, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.EUV machines use an element like tungsten or cobalt shot at a very high speed with a laser to create a beam of light with a high enough frequency to etch with an ultrathin line. This will allow more features to fit on each silicon wafer.Intel, Samsung and others are betting that ASML's EUV machines will be the future of making 10-nanometer nodes and could eventually be used to create seven-nanometer nodes. A nanometer is one millionth of a meter.Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a July 19 note that ASML appears to have secured eight new orders from Samsung and Intel during the second quarter. They added that ASML is nearly fully booked on orders for the machines through 2018. The analysts also wrote that ASML saw orders from an undisclosed Chinese memory company with delivery expected later this year.ASML shares first ventured into buy range late last month and then briefly fell below it before breaking out of a flat base and returning to buy territory earlier this month. On Friday, shares were up fractionally to 162.41 on the stock market today.The company is part of Investor's Business Daily's Electric-Semiconductor Equipment group, which also includes Applied Materials (AMAT) and MKS Instruments (MKSI). The group is ranked No. 20 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.EUV technology is expensive, with each machine running at nearly $120 million. ASML has about 27 machines in backlog, valued at $3.2 billion. Right now the company is just shipping out 10 per year, but has its sights set on shipping up to 40 per year in the next three to four years.Samsung and others are using the current machines for research and development, but future iterations expected in the 2019-20 time frame will be ready for use in full-scale chip production.Iyer said the orders from Samsung and other key players in the semiconductor space are the proof needed for investors that the EUV machine is ready for prime time.IBD'S TAKE: ASML isn't the only tech stock in buy range. Here's a list of other stocks near their entry points. ""Customers don't place orders if they don't feel like they are anywhere close by,"" he said. ""We think that this is going to be a big product cycle story that could carry on for the next 10 years and be an inflection point for them.""Iyer said the company has worked out past bugs with the machine and determined it is successful technology. The unknown now is when it will be launched.""For a few years there were a lot of questions about it, skepticism around the viability of this technology given how complex the physics of it is,"" he said, adding the current market is probably only about $360 million this year but could jump to $4.8 billion to $6 billion over the next five years.""Every one of their anchor customers has endorsed that this is the only way to go to the next technology node,"" Iyer said. ""Apple's iPhone next year will probably have something with EUV.""Further, the entire EUV market could be ASML's for the taking.ASML ""is a natural monopoly because the technology they are developing is uneconomical for anyone else to develop and it's very difficult,"" said Farhan Ahmad, an analyst of semiconductor equipment at Credit Suisse.Nikon has pretty much bowed out of the seven-nanometer EUV space. Meanwhile, the high research-and-development costs needed to create the complicated technology have kept smaller players out of the race.But while ASML isn't facing competition risk with other EUV makers, Ahmad is still concerned that tech companies could decide to use another technology to create seven-nanometer chips.""We have a neutral rating on the stock because there is a lot of technology risk on the company,"" Ahmad said. ""The problem they are trying to solve with EUV is very difficult.""RELATED: Leading Chip Stock Takes The Elite Place In A Strong IndustryThe B-2 Maker Is Also A Stealth Chip Giant And Competes Commercially

504,L,"Hodges Small Intrinsic Value Fund (HDSVX) is off to a good start, thanks to its three-heads-are-better-than-one management style and an appetite for leading stocks such Emergent BioSolutions (EBS), Consolidated Tomoka (CTO), Westwood Holdings (WHG) and U.S. Concrete (USCR).IBD'S TAKE: Emergent and U.S. Concrete are members of IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose IBD EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.XOpen less than five years, the $106.6 million fund topped the S&P 500 in 2016, and its average annual gain topped the broad market bogey over the three years ended last Dec. 31.The fund's outperformance won it recognition as an ""Upstart"" in IBD's 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards. And it did so in three categories: diversified equity, blend and small-cap stock mutual funds.Now we'll see if the fund can earn full Best Mutual Fund Awards winner status once it's been open long enough by adding outperformance over the market benchmark over the trailing five and 10 years as well as the most recent calendar year.This year through Aug. 31, the fund was down 1.22% due in part to a rocky first quarter vs. an 11.93% gain by the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Direct. But over the most recent three months the fund is up 5.10% vs. 3.01% for the bogey and 1.53% for its small-cap peer group.The fund's lead manager is Eric Marshall. Derek Maupin and Chris Terry are active co-managers. Co-managers Gary Bradshaw and Craig Hodges don't participate in day-to-day management.And the fund's three-heads-are-better-than-one system? Each of the three active managers can pick investments without prior approval from the other managers.Marshall, who is 44 years old, along with 35-year-old Maupin talked about their investment approach with IBD from their offices in Dallas.IBD: Summarize your fund's investment approach, please.Marshall: Domestic equity is our primary focus. Our philosophy is to be deep divers in fundamental research. We talk with companies, with their suppliers, vendors, customers, competitors. We develop a thesis about how much upside it has vs. downside risk.In this fund we focus on many areas with the small-cap universe that are underfollowed and where we feel the market's perceptions and the underlying reality of the fundamentals are disconnected — where we feel there is an alpha (outperformance vs. the benchmark) to be made by buying things at valuations we feel don't truly reflect the intrinsic value of a company.IBD: You and co-managers Derek Maupin and Chris Terry don't need to approve each other's trades?Marshall: I'm lead manager, but it's very much a team effort. We give each guy autonomy to be responsible for his own names. We don't have to vote on ideas. We hold each other accountable. Each of us can buy or sell a name as he sees fit.IBD: Does that mean each manager has lots of leeway within a collaborative system, or that you three don't brainstorm together at all?Marshall: As a team we collaborate on the entire portfolio daily, but (we) try to avoid groupthink by giving each manager the independence to make individual decisions without a consensus.IBD: The fund outperformed the S&P 500 in 2016 and in the three years ended Dec. 31. You'll have a five-year record soon, right?Marshall: Its inception was Dec. 26, 2013. In December 2018 we'll have a five-year track record, and it will look pretty good, assuming we don't have any major underperformance in the back half of this year (and in 2018).IBD: The fund outperformed the S&P 500 in 2016 and in the three years ended Dec. 31. What does it take to outperform repeatedly?Marshall: I don't know that every fund can outperform in every environment out there. But what we found is that over the long run, the key is owning value and finding opportunities that may be less obvious to the market.A lot of analysts and fund managers are good at understanding the underlying fundamentals of a company. But it's also important to understand the market's perception of that. If everyone thinks a company is the best, it may not be the best investment no matter how good its fundamentals are.I don't want to say we're contrarian, but we look for companies that may not be as widely owned by institutional investors, that are just starting to come under accumulation by institutional investors.IBD: How important is risk control?Marshall: We want protection. We want much more upside than downside. As a stock's price goes up and risk vs. reward gets more balanced, we start to sell. We scale out. It's just like buying. We don't buy a stock all at once either.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what's your thesis for Emergent BioSolutions, whose earnings per share rose 4% and 1,400% the past two quarters after declining for three quarters in a row? They make vaccines and therapeutics to combat potential biowarfare weapons.Marshall: Chris Terry brought it into the portfolio. They make specialty products for civilian and military populations. Because they do a lot of contracts with government entities, they sometimes tend to be lumpy in their financial results. But over the long run they are highly profitable, and relative to other companies in their industry they are inexpensive.IBD: How does real estate developer Consolidated Tomoka fit your investment approach?Maupin: We believe it's a classic intrinsic value play. The stock trades at about a 25% discount to market value of the underlying real estate. CTO owns about 8,000 acres in and around Daytona Beach, Fla.; 36 income producing properties; 500,000 acres of subsurface mineral rights; a golf course; and mitigation credits. The stock flies under the radar (in part because it has just) a $315 million market cap and has little trading liquidity. (But) monetizing land assets and the potential for a REIT conversion in 2019 will help close the discount in stock price.IBD: What will it close that discount to? It's trading around 55 now.Maupin: We think the fair value of the company's assets, net of debt, is around $75 per share. We expect CTO to close the discount gap through selling land and replacing it with income-producing properties. When the asset mix look more like a traditional REIT, we expect the company to fetch a valuation in line with its REIT peer group.IBD: Asset manager Westwood Holdings has trended higher since May. What's your thesis?Marshall: This company has been penalized by outflows from active managers. But they are under the radar and undervalued. They trade at a low P-E ratio. They have little sell-side coverage. Partly because they have a $500 million market cap, larger institutions can't own them. They're trading at an attractive valuation relative to their assets under management. They're a Dallas company we know well.IBD: As managers based in Texas, you've got an up close and personal view of the impact of Hurricane Harvey on Texas-based companies. Three such holdings of yours rallied right after the storm, which was a disaster for Houston and other parts of Texas. One is LGI Homes (LGIH), in which you've been building your stake in recent portfolio disclosures. After slumping for much of August, it has rallied. What's the appeal?Marshall: Over the long run, we've added to it when it pulled back. They're an entry-level homebuilder that provides comprehensive services. They build homes and provide buys with financing services. They have heavy exposure to Texas.Back in 2005, when energy prices were rolling over, this company got clobbered. People saw it as tied to oil and gas. When (co-manager) Derek Maupin looked at it, what he saw was different from the market's perception. Unlike other homebuilders, LGI's entry-level home sales were picking up because those buyers were not in the oil and gas industry. We turned it into one of our largest positions.IBD: The company is based near Houston. Why has it rallied since Hurricane Harvey?Maupin: We do expect some short-term disruption in deliveries and (home-sale) closings to be pushed out (in time). (But) long-term, we expect LGIH to play a critical role in rebuilding Houston's housing stock.IBD: Some additional holdings of yours also are based in Texas and rallied right after Hurricane Harvey. Do these stand to benefit from the rebuild that will follow the tragic storm? For example, you still hold construction service company Primoris Services (PRIM), even though you've trimmed your exposure. What's your view? Why have they've gotten a little post-Harvey lift?Maupin: They have a diversified portfolio of engineering, construction and maintenance projects around the country. They have some located on the Gulf Coast. They're going to see short-term disruption and long-term benefit. There will be a need for industrial plants to be repaired and rebuilt. There will be a great need to rebuild infrastructure in areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey.IBD: And why did U.S. Concrete, which is based northwest of Dallas, rally after the storm?Marshall: The week leading up to the storm, U.S. Concrete share price got hit by concerns that the wet weather in Texas would hurt its September quarter by slowing its ability to pour concrete.What the Street did not understand is that the majority of their exposure to the Texas market is tied to north Texas, around Dallas-Ft. Worth, which didn't have much unfavorable weather compared to a year ago. They won't see that big of an impact from the hurricane.IBD: So otherwise is the stock a straightforward infrastructure play?Marshall: Some investors turn up their noses at this business because they think it has low barriers to entry. Unless you're in dense urban areas or places like the Northeast where there are a lot of labor unions. Then entry is more problematic.This company's main markets are New York, New Jersey, Dallas-Ft. Worth, San Francisco. Being the No. 1 player in these markets lets them raise prices. In the downturn, a lot of mom-and-pop competitors went out of business.When we first bought about three years ago, we had no idea Trump would be elected. Even if Clinton had been elected, there are aging infrastructure that need to be replaced. And the federal FAST Act (for infrastructure spending) was enacted prior to this election. So this has benefited somewhat from the Trump bump, but it's not primarily an investment on that issue.RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

505,L,"Steel is the backbone of a modern industrial nation. Without a healthy steel industry, a country will suffer disproportionately as jobs, R&D and technological know-how move offshore, and profits are no longer available for investment in new products and processes.Severe damage to the American steel industry would lead inevitably to decline as the country becomes dependent on foreign producers for the basic building blocks — not just commercial but also military — of an advanced society.Can America afford to be at the mercy of foreign producers for its steel needs? Would that be wise in the current, unstable global environment — one in which we might have to ramp up steel production quickly for military use?The answer is clear: No, it is not wise economically, commercially, or militarily to be foreign-dependent for critical products.This is why the recent Commerce Department hearing on the state of our steel industry under the little-used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 is so significant. The U.S. government, under an April 20 memorandum from President Trump, is finally looking at survival of U.S.-sited steel companies from a national security point of view — not just a commercial point of view.Here's the problem: The world is awash in steel overcapacity and overproduction. Foreign nations have built up their steel industries — very often through the use of large government subsidies — to a point far beyond what is needed to supply their home markets. In order to keep their steel facilities humming and their domestic workforces employed, these foreign steel companies send their excess production abroad, selling it for cut-rate prices.Additionally, countries such as China use a method of cheating called transshipment — that is, they ship their steel to third countries to make it look as if it were domestically produced there. Then it's sold forward into the U.S. market with its true Chinese origin obscured.President Trump came to power promising new policies to address our annual $500 billion-plus trade deficit. With his Section 232 memorandum, he has taken specific action and indicated that foreign-trade cheating in steel (and also aluminum) will no longer be tolerated.U.S. companies are under multiple attacks. An iconic company such as U.S. Steel has to contend not only with underpriced foreign steel flooding the U.S. market, but also with the theft of its trade secrets through Chinese government hacking.U.S. Steel is one of America's leading R&D companies and it has developed a proprietary process to make a particular type of steel lighter and stronger. After investing considerable time and money, U.S. Steel anticipated great success — only to find that Chinese government hackers had stolen the ""formula"" for the new product.The Chinese government passed the stolen information to one of its ""national champion"" companies, Baosteel, which now sells the product in the American market cheaper than U.S. Steel can make if here at home.Usually, an American firm in such a position must pursue a case under U.S. trade law, which U.S. Steel is doing. Such cases are time-consuming and expensive. Worse, the foreign competitor, as the Chinese have done in the U.S. Steel case, can play games and just be uncooperative. So American companies founder while these trade cases drag on.The beauty of a 232 investigation is that it can be done quickly — a maximum of 270 days after it is initiated, which is far more quickly than yearslong trade cases. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said that he intended to be finished by the end of June, a little over two months after President Trump ordered the investigation, but the decision has been delayed. Still, it's expected to be acted on soon.Further, in a 232 case, the affected industry does not have to jump through multiple legal hoops. The perspective is broader with the fate of an industry considered through the prism of national security.Finally, the president has substantial power in ordering a remedy. He can adjust the level and type of imports by imposing tariffs, setting numerical limits (quotas), or take other types of appropriate action — such as allowing entry of some types of steel not produced domestically while barring most others.As might be expected, the Chinese and other major steel producers are dead set against any U.S. action. So are American companies who buy steel products and are only too happy to get them at the lower, ""dumped"" price.Buying subsidized steel fattens a company's profits for a time, but over the longer term, damage done to a leading American industry and the overall economy means slower growth, lower profits, and potentially dangerous foreign dependency.President Trump tweeted after the public hearing that he's looking forward to receiving the results of the Section 232 investigation, and that he will ""take major action if necessary."" Consultations with the Chinese, the Europeans and others have produced little relief.Even casual observers know there is a massive steel overproduction problem that is not being addressed. Hopefully, the Commerce Department will document irrefutably the impact of the problem on U.S. national security and recommend effective remedies to President Trump, who will then act decisively in the national interest.

It took a poll attempting to figure out very publicly whether the voters want Trump impeached yet.Reporters Susan Page and Emma Kinery proclaimed a dark omen in the results, which is why the newspaper asked the poll question. They said, ""Just six months after his inauguration, Americans already are split down the middle, 42%-42%, over whether President Trump should be removed from office, a new USA TODAY/iMediaEthics Poll finds.""What's the impeachable offense? If a national poll were to emerge with a 42-42 tie over the belief that the moon is made of Swiss cheese, would the subsequent analysis focus on the concentration of moon matter or the irrationality of 42% of the American people?It doesn't matter that the prospect for impeachment is zero with Republicans in control of Congress. ""The results,"" they reported, ""underscore how quickly political passions have become inflamed both for and against the outsider candidate who won last year's campaign in a surprise.""Translation: The media's passions have been inflamed because Trump surprised them by beating Hillary Clinton. The media, like the rest of the Democrats, have refused to accept the election results. They believe it's an illegitimate presidency.It doesn't matter at all to them that recent polls show Clinton remains every bit as unpopular today as she was in November. It doesn't matter at all to them that Democrats can't win a special election and remain in the wilderness. President Trump must go.Here's what's weird about this poll: Trump's approval rating is 44%, and 51% disapprove. That's actually a better result than most national polls. It's also strange that only 27% said they believe there's enough evidence now to impeach Trump, and another 30% expect that such evidence will surface ... eventually.USA Today turned to ""the people"" — Trump-hating people — to comment on the poll. One was Vera Peete of Antioch, California, who said, ""I don't really trust him — all the things he's done while he's in office, all of the lies, the investigation that goes on with him, the things he says to his staff.""Peete was identified as an independent who voted for Clinton, so the idea of hating a president who piles on the lies and is dogged by investigations looks pretty ridiculous, given Bill and Hillary Clintons' history of lying and scandal. Nowhere in the paper did these reporters find space for a pro-Trump voter — a voter who actually elected this president.Instead, USA Today kept piling on doom and gloom about America's relentless turmoil and unease. The writers said: ""More than a third, 36%, say Trump isn't likely to complete his first term, for whatever reason. Only about one in four, 27%, express confidence he'll serve all four years of his term. Even one in 10 Republicans doubt he'll finish his tenure.""A look at the actual poll results demonstrated that the paper couldn't even report its own results accurately. Their pollster found a clear majority of 57% believing Trump will finish his first term — 27% said ""definitely will,"" and another 30% said ""probably will."" Only 36% disagreed.Now, imagine if a national newspaper had asked voters in 2009 whether then-President Barack Obama should be impeached, or questioned whether he would finish his term. The left would have exploded in rage over the inherent racism in such preposterous questions. After all, at that point, Democrats were in control of both houses of Congress. Who thought that was plausible?As we can see, plausibility has nothing to do with it. It's all about the media's relentless partisanship and scheming with poll questions.

513,L,"The world of television and how Hollywood delivers it keeps changing. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have become prestigious brands whose original programming draws a pile of Emmy nominations. In 2017, Netflix has received 91 Emmy nominations, second only to HBO's 111. Hulu has 18 nominations, and Amazon has 16, just a few less than Fox's 21.But as much as technology changes, some things remain the same. The entertainment factories keep ripping on Republican politicians in the crudest terms. Hulu has created a sitcom called ""Difficult People."" The characters are two unlikeable, self-absorbed stand-up comedians. In the new season, they're taking out the political pitchforks.One of the comedians, a gay man named Billy, mocks Vice President Mike Pence as a ""failed prototype for one of those Japanese sex robots."" The ridiculous plot involves Billy pretending to participate in a new Pence program called Sixpence None the Gayer, where the federal government pays gay people $6,000 to become straight through electric shock therapy.When Billy joins this purported Pence program to get the cash, a package arrives in the mail complete with beer, a ""Make America Straight Again"" hat and an electric shock therapy kit. Liberals have tried to insist Pence favored government funding of conversion therapy, pointing to a pledge on his 2000 campaign website that favors ""assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" Lost on them is the irony — or hypocrisy, really — that they favor transgender people in the military or prison doing that very thing.Billy also notices a new vice presidential seal on an envelope: a red, white and blue swastika. You see, stupid voters put Nazis in the White House.""Difficult People"" viciously mocks the Reagans, too. When an elderly man has trouble with a computer at work, a younger man complains, ""I don't need to watch you fumble around like Ronald Reagan."" Later, a sobriety sponsor for one of the comedians proclaims, ""Nancy Reagan was an AIDS-ignoring monster.""The Reagans ignoring AIDS is one of the sturdiest lies of the Hollywood left.But that show looks like ""Masterpiece Theater"" next to Netflix's comedy ""Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later."" The show is based on an old movie about kids attending summer camp at Camp Firewood in 1981. It is set in 1991, and its plotters inserted former President Reagan boasting that he stole a nuclear weapon after he left office so he could blow up the summer camp. This is just too asinine to be funny.And it gets more stupid by the minute. Reagan and then-President George H.W. Bush come to camp, and someone proposes — complete with a diorama — that instead of blowing up the camp they rebuild it as a Reagan tribute. Crazy Reagan throws the diorama on the floor and urinates on it. But that's not enough. Then he defecates on it. That's still not enough. He then makes President Bush defecate on it, because Bush did whatever Reagan ordered him to do. See?On some TV shows the Reagan bashing is much more realistic. A recent episode of the FX series ""Snowfall"" — the feverish one trying to connect the explosion of crack cocaine in Los Angeles to Reagan backing the Nicaraguan resistance — had a scene in which a former Black Panther is throwing darts at a painted image of Reagan's head. Imagine anyone in TV Land uncorking plots and visuals this mean-spirited on the Kennedys, the Clintons or the Obamas.We know the left remains emotionally overwrought by the reality that Donald Trump was elected president, but its never-ending demonization of the Reagans shows that its anger never softens. Its bitterness never relents.

518,L,"How will Hurricane Harvey, a disaster for people and property, impact publicly traded stocks?XEric Marshall and Derek Maupin, lead manager and a co-manager respectively of Texas-based Hodges Small Intrinsic Value Fund (HDSVX), talk about that impact on several Texas-based stocks they hold in IBD's upcoming monthly mutual fund manager question-and-answer feature. Here is an excerpt from that feature report.Hodges Capital Management is based in inland Dallas, which escaped the worst wrath of the superstrong killer storm. Some 240 miles to the southeast, Houston and other Gulf coastal areas got clobbered. So did regions in Louisiana and northward as the storm barged inland. On faraway Wall Street, many investors misunderstand these stocks and the storm's impact on them, Marshall says.IBD: You've been building your stake in LGI Homes (LGIH) in recent portfolio disclosures. After slumping for much of August, it has rallied. What's the appeal?Marshall: Over the long run, we've added to it when it pulled back. They're an entry-level homebuilder that provides comprehensive services. They build homes and provide buyers with financing services. They have heavy exposure to Texas.Back in 2005, when energy prices were rolling over, this company got clobbered. People saw it as tied to oil and gas. When (co-manager) Derek Maupin looked at it, what he saw was different from the market's perception. Unlike other homebuilders, LGI's entry level home sales were picking up because those buyers were not in the oil and gas industry. We turned it into one of our largest positions.IBD'S TAKE: LGI Homes has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. The homebuilder also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.IBD: The company is based near Houston. Why has it rallied since Hurricane Harvey?Maupin: We do expect some short-term disruption in deliveries and (home-sale) closings to be pushed out (in time). (But) long-term, we expect LGIH to play a critical role in rebuilding Houston's housing stock.IBD: Some additional holdings of yours also are based in Texas and rallied right after Hurricane Harvey. Do these stand to benefit from the rebuild that will follow the tragic storm? For example, you still hold construction service company Primoris Services (PRIM), even though you've trimmed your exposure. What's your view? Why have they've gotten a little post-Harvey lift?Maupin: They have a diversified portfolio of engineering, construction and maintenance projects around the country. They have some located on the Gulf Coast. They're going to see short-term disruption and long-term benefit. There will be a need for industrial plants to be repaired and rebuilt. There will be a great need to rebuild infrastructure in areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey.IBD: And what's your view on U.S. Concrete (USCR), which rallied after the storm?Marshall: The week leading up to the storm, U.S. Concrete share price got hit by concerns that the wet weather in Texas would hurt its September quarter by slowing its ability to pour concrete.What the Street did not understand is that the majority of their exposure to the Texas market is tied to north Texas, around Dallas-Ft. Worth, which didn't have much unfavorable weather compared to a year ago. They won't see that big of an impact from the hurricane.RELATED:Primoris Ranks No. 1 In IBD's Building-Heavy Construction Industry Group.

521,L,"CNN reporter Jim Acosta pitched another fit in the White House briefing room on Aug. 2, asserting that President Trump's immigration policy was refuted by a poem engraved on a plaque on the Statue of Liberty. Trump aide Stephen Miller fought him tooth and nail, slamming him for a ""cosmopolitan bias."" There was no doubt that the liberal elites would sympathize with the acidic Acosta.HBO's comedic anchorman John Oliver uncorked how the media really felt, denouncing Miller as ""one of the most revolting humans"" he has ever seen and a ""vitamin D-deficient minion,"" whatever that means.Everyone is used to Trump & Co. being on the wrong end of the liberal media's brigade of ""independent fact-checkers."" The Washington Post ""Fact Checker"" team arrived on what it accurately called the ""debate"" between Miller and Acosta. Michelle Ye Hee Lee insisted this was more about checking Miller. ""The Fact Checker is not a media critic, and we generally do not fact-check members of the media — certainly not the opinions of individual journalists,"" she said.Isn't that extraordinary? It is below the media to analyze themselves. But here's what's surprising: She had to admit that Miller was correct on all three statements she evaluated.First, Acosta lectured that Miller was trying to ""change"" immigration policy by requiring immigrants to speak English and cited the Emma Lazarus poem about the huddled masses ""yearning to breathe free.""Lee ruled, ""Miller is correct that English proficiency currently is a requirement for naturalization."" She tried to soften the blow by declaring: ""Neither got it quite right about the Statue of Liberty. The statue, indeed, was a gift from France as a symbol of liberty enlightening the world — not about immigration."" But then, she weirdly asserted that the biographer of Lazarus believed she ""was the first American to make any sense of this statue.""Acosta kept badgering Miller about English proficiency, and ""that's never been what the United States has been about,"" he says. Miller replied: ""But your statement's shockingly ahistorical in another respect, too, which is if you look at the history of immigration, it's actually ebbed and flowed. We've had periods of very large waves, followed by periods of less immigration, and more immigration.""Lee ruled: ""Miller is correct. Immigration levels ebbed and flowed throughout U.S. history, and the flow was controlled through restrictive legislation until 1965."" Liberals can despair over it, but that's history.Then Acosta really fell on his face. He said, ""But this whole notion of, 'Well, they could learn — you know, they have to learn English before they get to the United States,' are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?""Miller went for the knockout and responded: ""I am shocked at your statement that you think that only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English. It reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree. ... It's so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world.""The Post fact-checker ruled: ""Miller has the edge here. English is an official language in dozens of countries other than Great Britain and Australia, and is spoken in roughly 100 countries. It is the most commonly studied foreign language in the world.""When Miller was done, Acosta complained, ""You called me ignorant on national television."" The Washington Post ""fact-checker"" squad must have agonized as it underlined Acosta as the ignorant half of this exchange. If it did, kudos to the Washington Post for breaking the mold.

522,L,"You've studied up on the CAN SLIM acronym, and you know what you are looking for in a leading growth stock. The next questions: How and where to find it?Investors face a jungle-dense world of online research offerings: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, CNBC and Bloomberg, to name a few. All offer an impressive slate of research. But none of them truly know CAN SLIM.Instead, use IBD's powerful Stock Checkup tool, backed by the extensive research resources of William O'Neil + Co.'s proprietary stock database. It is built entirely around identifying and vetting CAN SLIM stocks.To find it, simply type a stock ticker into the search window on the investors.com home page. (The box is marked with a magnifying glass icon and ""Enter Symbol/Keyword."")The search takes you to the Stock Quote, a page packed with an array of information about your stock. It also includes, to the lower left of the stock chart, a Composite Rating box, next to which is a link that says, ""Get A Stock Checkup."" (You can also find Stock Checkup by pointing to ""Research"" in the main navigation bar on the Investors.com homepage.)Follow that link to dive immediately into CAN SLIM research.The C: For current quarterly earnings and sales, start with a look at the stock's EPS Rating within its group. A high ranking is a good gauge of fundamental strength, particularly in a strong group.Drop down to the Fundamental Performance table, and you will find EPS growth in the most recent quarter as well as the average increase over the past three quarters and the number of quarters of EPS acceleration. The colored dots to the right of those numbers tell you whether the growth rate is strong (green), middling (yellow) or weak (red).The A: One heading lower is annual earnings. It gives three-year EPS growth, consecutive years of EPS increases and the EPS estimate for the current year. Seek increases of 25% or greater.The N: To see if the stock is making new highs from valid bases, drop to the bottom of the page.The page provides a chart that will give a sense of where the stock is in technical terms. Below the chart, a list of recent IBD articles offer perspectives on the company in terms of new products, new management or a change in operations.The S & I: Readings on supply and demand of shares as well as institutional support are combined under the Technical Performance header. It provides an Accumulation/Distribution Rating that suggests to what degree institutions appear to be building or exiting positions in the stock.The Up/Down Volume gauge gives another angle on the buying-vs.-selling picture. A ratio of higher than 1.0 is positive. Also check the increase or decrease in total funds owning the stock, as well as the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership.For instance, let's look  Sina (SINA). The Chinese internet and social media play holds an excellent score for RS (96), a top-notch Composite Rating of 99, and excellent earnings increases in recent quarters. Earnings per share jumped 159% vs. the year-ago quarter. Plus, Sina beat the consensus EPS estimate by an impressive 22.8%. No wonder you'll see a green dot next to this figure in the Fundamental Performance section of Sina's Stock Checkup.But its up/down volume ratio of 0.7 is less than ideal. Notice how the Stock Checkup gives Sina a yellow dot for this factor, which is neutral. It justifies the need to do a little more research, including a study of the chart action and the quality of the current base.Sina broke out of a cup with handle with a 95.59 buy point in late July. The price action has been choppy. However, gains in recent days and a strong reversal on Aug. 9 have taken place in big turnover — a clue that some funds are actively buying shares.The L: Leader or laggard? The quick, easy gauges here are the bar gauges at the top of the page: EPS Rating; Relative Price Strength Rating; Sales + Margin + Return On Equity (SMR) Rating; and Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Each rates the stock vs. the overall market, as well as other stocks in its group.The M: Last and easiest to monitor is market direction. The first header, General Market, gives the market's status and a green, yellow or red dot. A yellow dot is like a yellow traffic signal: Proceed with caution.You can read more about the market via the Big Picture column each day (find it at ""Market Trend"" on the home page) and in the IBD Weekly print edition, in the B section.(A version of this article originally appeared in the Jan. 21, 2015, edition of IBD.)RELATED:How To Count Bases And Learn When To SellWhen To Sell Stocks: Watch For Severe Weakness In A Stock's Industry GroupWhen To Sell Stocks II: Why The Biggest Single-Day Point Drop Signals A Stock Has Topped

524,L,"The Hollywood Reporter unveiled that PBS and its public broadcasting brethren have written the Federal Communications Commission with a list of complaints. The headline reads, ""PBS Wants the Government to Re-examine Hard Stance on Indecency.""That's funny, since we haven't seen a ""hard stance on indecency"" since the Hays Code a half-century ago. And that wasn't even the government. Since then, liberals have successfully thwarted almost any effort to have the federal government enact broadcast decency rules, even those codified by the Supreme Court. By the time Barack Obama became president, all thoughts of regulation were abandoned.In 2012, midway through the Obama years, the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that Fox Television Stations could not be fined for a 2004 awards show broadcast in which ""fleeting"" profanities were hurled in an exchange between then-reality TV stars Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court that the FCC's attempts to enforce a fine on curse words — which were blatantly obvious to everyone watching on TV — were ""unconstitutionally vague.""It's not as if PBS were ground zero for a controversy over the seven dirty words you're not supposed to say on television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., which is not to say PBS doesn't want to be. It was joined in its proposal by lawyers from National Public Radio, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the lobbying group America's Public Television Stations.What irony! These noncommercial stations were supposed to show commercial broadcasters how to behave with class and decorum. But they are a sandbox for the left, and thus, they will crusade for the left with no fear of backlash from their liberal audiences.The FCC recently issued a memo requesting on how they might ""modernize"" media regulation. So the complaint demands the FCC ""return to its long-standing pre-2004 policy of generally deferring to broadcasters' reasonable good faith editorial judgment in these matters"" and ""empower FCC staff to more quickly address complaints, including by disposing of meritless complaints that can negatively impact stations by remaining unresolved for extended periods of time."" That would show ""appropriate deference to the essential First Amendment values and interests.""But PBS and NPR want to make Obama's flushing of the decency rules a permanent policy. In 2014, the public broadcasting site Current.org reported that public broadcasters in Texas, Louisiana and Minnesota ""were among the almost 700 broadcasters whose licenses were renewed en masse earlier this month, after the FCC quietly cleared many stations nationwide of indecency charges.""These days, the FCC has moved on from profanity enforcement. On July 10, it proposed a record $120 million fine to one man who apparently made millions of unlawful ""spoofed"" robocalls in violation of the Truth in Caller ID Act.PBS and NPR stations are the vanguard of a new regime of ""progressive"" decency, funded by the taxpayers. As we noted a few weeks ago with the PBS documentary ""Real Boy,"" the newly banned speech on public broadcasting is ""misgendering"" or in any way criticizing a transgender activist. Opposing their utopian agenda is today's definition of obscenity.This is not to say that PBS has lost sight of regulatory responsibilities. When Obama came into office, it started banning something else nationwide instead: religious programming. For example, the Washington, D.C., PBS station WHUT canceled ""Mass for Shut-Ins,"" since that broadcast from the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception was somehow more offensive to the taxpaying public than profanity. (It moved to a commercial channel.)

531,L,"Back in those ancient days when teletypes gave us the sound effects for news, The Associated Press was esteemed as the gold standard of objective news coverage. Inside a liberal media bubble, that pretense continues. But for decades now, AP has tacked hard to port along with the rest of the media establishment. They'll deny it, of course, because that's what they do.But the evidence is there, emblazoned in the AP Stylebook, which sets the rules for the language of news reporting. It also sets the tone of the media elite's daily composition in every format — print, online or broadcast. They say it ""defines clear news writing"" and call it ""the journalist's bible,"" which is a fairly damning phrase, since it rejects the Bible.In the biblical account, we are created by God and assigned our sex. But the term ""gender,"" AP's gurus now instruct, is ""not synonymous with sex."" Rather, the term ""refers to a person's social identity while sex refers to biological characteristics."" The ""objective"" reporter is required to set biology aside and describe people as they ""identify"" themselves socially.AP doubles down, exploiting the authority of ""medical organizations"" to bend biology. It says, ""Not all people fall under one of two categories for sex or gender, according to leading medical organizations, so avoid references to both, either or opposite sexes or genders as a way to encompass all people.""The AP Stylebook rejects the principle of marriage, lecturing reporters to not call the children of unmarried parents ""illegitimate,"" and to always avoid referring to a homosexual ""preference"" or ""lifestyle.""Labels have power. In the abortion debate, there are the preferred labels, ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice."" But when it comes to killing unborn children, AP insists you should not use the term ""pro-life."" It instructs reporters to say ""anti-abortion,"" in keeping with the constant desire to define conservatives in the negative — anti-tax, anti-immigrant and so on. And the other side? The stylebook has that covered: It is ""pro-abortion rights.""Let's go international. There, too, AP bows to left-wing pressure. It discourages the use of ""Islamist,"" along with that it now says are its negative connotations, ""Islamic fighters, militants, extremists or radicals, who may or may not be Islamists."" Terrorists should be defined as ""militants."" We may rout the Islamic State on the battlefield, but the Stylebook waves a white flag on the language.Years ago, we were told to stop using the phrase ""illegal alien."" They're ""immigrants,"" we were instructed. Bizarrely, AP is now discouraging the plain words ""migrant"" or ""refugee"" as Syrians flee to Europe. Instead, the experts tell reporters to call them (and we're not making this up) ""people struggling to enter Europe."" We might struggle with our luggage when arriving at the airport in Venice, Italy. Does that make us ""refugees""?In the climate debate, the left wants conservatives labeled ""deniers,"" ""denialists"" or worse. AP pushes back, but only a bit. It says, ""To describe those who don't accept climate science or dispute that the world is warming from man-made forces, use climate change doubters"" — oh, if only it had stopped there — ""or those who reject mainstream climate science.""Perhaps next it will instruct that critics of the AP Stylebook must be described as ""those who reject mainstream media political correctness.""

535,L,"Going to school after the regular school day is over doesn't sound like a lot of fun for students, but it's a booming market for China's private-education providers.XThanks to a ""dramatic"" increase in disposable income in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the continued competitive state of China's education system and a decade-old population boom that is now translating to a recent influx of primary-school-age students, the state of the nation's after-school tutoring sector is ""very robust,"" 86Research analyst Yuzhong Gao told Investor's Business Daily.And that points to continued growth for China's largest private education provider, New Oriental Education (EDU) — as well as its peers. Both New Oriental and its main rival, TAL Education (TAL) are gaining market share from smaller competitors.""Currently, because (New Oriental) and TAL have very good teacher quality, and they have very high teaching standards, they provide better teaching quality,"" said Gao.Founded in 1993 with just one school in Beijing, New Oriental now has 855 learning centers, including 77 schools, and in fiscal 2017 raked in nearly $1.8 billion in revenue.Its 4.86 million students are enrolled a wide range of classes. The littlest ones, aged 5 through 12, learn English, music and other subjects in what it calls the POP Kids program, though the company's website says that it can enroll children as young as 3 years old. Meanwhile, high schoolers plow through history or physics lessons after school, and grown-ups who have returned from overseas utilize New Oriental's job placement services.Reporting fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on July 25, New Oriental came out ahead of Street forecasts as earnings grew 40.5% to 41 cents in American depositary receipts on 23% sales growth to $486.4 million, according to the company. Analysts had expected 38 cents earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.During the quarter, total student enrollment rose 36.9% from the prior year as the total number of schools and learning centers grew by 107. CCB International analyst Eric Qiu, who has an outperform rating on the company, noted New Oriental's center growth is a result of ""strong student demand.""""In light of New Oriental's target of 17-21% revenue growth in (fiscal 2018's first quarter) — seasonally the weakest quarter for growth — and the rapid pace of new learning center openings, we expect revenue growth to fully ramp up in (the second to fourth quarters) and continue well into (fiscal 2019) provided openings stay on track,"" he wrote on July 26, upping his price target to 96 from 76.Shares briefly entered a buy zone the day after earnings, clearing a 82.72 entry point from a cup-with-handle base, but have failed to properly break out in the ensuing sessions.Still, New Oriental's heft as a single company is but a drop in the ocean. The industry is fragmented, with ""tens of thousands"" of other private-education companies across China, according to Gao. And analysts say that collectively, New Oriental and TAL Education together account for a mere 4%-5% or so of the entire after-school market in the country.The bulk of New Oriental's learning centers are located in Beijing, which has 97, and in Shanghai with 52, as the company expands into smaller ""tier 3"" and ""tier 4"" cities. ""Smaller"" in China is a relative term, of course: 86Research's Gao says a tier-3 city is about 3-4 million people big; the populace of a tier 4 town is about 1-2 million, bigger than most U.S. cities.New Oriental's origins were in test prep for Chinese students looking to move abroad. But as that revenue stream has plateaued over the last few years, analysts say the company has turned its eye toward growing its K-12 business.IBD'S TAKE: China is entering a ""golden age"" of education, said Deloitte last year, and the country's versions of Kaplan and The Princeton Review are poised to flourish. Read this Snapshot from November for more.Calling its K-12 after-school programs a ""key revenue driver,"" Chief Financial Officer Stephen Yang said in the most recent earnings call that there are plans to add 10% to 15% new K-12 learning centers in existing cities. The company will also enter two to four new cities in the fiscal year, and is continuing its expansion into more rural areas.Gao noted on July 26 that in tandem with a rise in enrollment, students at New Oriental are also studying an increasing number of subjects at a time.""This shows (New Oriental) is well on track to transform itself from an English- focused after-school tutoring institution to an all-subject tutoring service provider,"" he wrote.But that doesn't mean New Oriental has not been without issues, and Gao said that in recent years the company has tightened control over its many branches, replacing local headmasters ""who did not answer to (the headquarters at) Beijing.""""By doing that it's been very successful,"" he said, later adding that ""a more centralized control by (New Oriental) over its local schools brings management efficiency, which translates into improvements in every aspects.""Separately, New Oriental and other Chinese tutoring schools have been under scrutiny Stateside. A Reuters investigation in late 2016 detailed allegations of college application fraud, and the American International Recruitment Council said in December that it would investigate the claims, sending shares of New Oriental tumbling over 14% in one session.The stock has more than recovered since then, climbing 85.5% since the start of the calendar year.Despite the fragmented market, neither Gao nor Qiu sees New Oriental getting an acquisitive itch anytime soon. Growth is likely to come from opening more centers and enrolling more students than engaging in M&A.RELATED:IBD 50's TAL Education Aces Earnings, But Stock Drops OutIBD 50 Chinese School Stock Recovers After Q4 Beat

537,L,"The media's sudden explosion over a meeting last summer at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and an alleged ""Kremlin-backed lawyer"" (she wasn't Kremlin-backed) has spawned a whole new feeding frenzy. Every miniscoop gets inflated into the latest contender in the urgent liberal question: ""What will finally get Trump impeached?""The liberal-media obsession was palpable, even when you pull your cell phone out. On the night of July 11, the CNN mobile app was all ablaze with the junior jeremiads. One after another, the headlines were panicky and tabloid-ish. They read:In the midst of this stream, down in the fifth spot was breaking news with the headline ""Special Ops Forces Among 16 Dead in Marine Corps Plane Crash."" Way down in the eighth spot was the headline ""Earth's Sixth Mass Extinction Is More Severe Than We Thought."" But alleged mass extinctions are boring next to Russia. The next headline was ""Tapper to Trump Jr.: Why So Many Lies?""This is why Trump fans have undertaken a campaign to give the CNN app a one-star rating in app stores, and the average of Apple reviews for the app did plummet to one star. Then, the rating mysteriously disappeared and was replaced by a very questionable note that said, ""We have not received enough ratings to display an average for the current version of this application.""The Daily Caller reported, ""Out of 3,215 total ratings awarded to the CNN on the app store, 3,063 of them were one-star ratings."" CNN critics had launched a political attack on their credibility.The website Big League Politics reported the same thing happened on Google Play — a burst of negative reviews followed by a disappearance. ""Nearly 20,000 one-star reviews of the CNN App disappeared overnight on Google Play, boosting CNN's ranking on its system,"" it said.The same people who criticize the Trump White House for eliminating the camera from press briefings are wiping its online ratings clean. Transparency is not their strong suit.The same Moscow-on-the-brain syndrome was dramatically obvious on CNN's airwaves on the morning of July 12. Our news watchers counted up the minutes on the ""New Day"" morning show that were devoted to Russia and other news. The result was jaw-dropping: Ninety-three percent of the news, or two hours and almost 16 minutes, was spent on Russia, and only 10 minutes were spent on the rest of the world. Eight minutes were set aside for the health care debate, and two were for the MLB All-Star Game. That was it.Not only that, in the next half-hour, before going to live coverage of confirmation hearings for FBI Director nominee Christopher Wray, it was 100% Russia, Russia, Russia.Obviously, the left thinks Russia is its silver bullet for Trump's impeachment, and CNN is its channel for obsessive round-the-clock prosecution. That's why it's laughable that The New York Times recently reported CNN is lagging in the ratings behind ""the more ideologically driven coverage of Fox News and MSNBC.""RELATED:Real Scandals The Trump-Obsessed Media Are IgnoringThe Media's Unhealthy Trump-Russia Obsession ...

539,L,"Stocks tend to follow the general market, so the current choppy conditions has created a number of new short consolidations. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index hit record highs on July 27, before reversing lower. The Nasdaq has yet to top that mark, while the S&P 500 index briefly did a few weeks later.XTracking the Nasdaq, four top-rated chip stocks have just carved out new flat bases and potential buy points: Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and chip-equipment makers ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).S&P 500 futures slid a fraction vs. fair value early Monday morning. So did futures for the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average.U.S. crude futures fell 1% in the wake of Hurricane Harvey slamming Texas. But gasoline futures jumped 5% as many refineries have gone off line and may remain so for several weeks due to massive flooding.Apple chipmaker Broadcom has an unusual pattern. The chipmaker just cleared a 256.88 flat-base buy point on July 26. Shares briefly moved higher on July 27 to 258.49, then reversed with the Nasdaq. Eventually, Broadcom fell 7.1% below that entry, making it invalid.Broadcom steadied, looking to form a new consolidation. The stock rose to 259.36 intraday Thursday, but not closing above the then-hypothetical 258.59 entry.Thursday night, Broadcom reported 42% earnings growth that topped forecasts with a solid earnings outlook. Sales and its sales guidance was in line. Analysts praised the report, citing strength in the Apple iPhone business, but investors apparently wanted more. Shares sank 3.7% in Friday stock market trading to 245.54, closing below their 50-day moving average.But on a weekly chart, Broadcom now has a valid flat base with a 258.59 buy point.As for Apple itself, its stock rose 0.4% to 159.86 on Friday, still in buy range from a 156.75 entry cleared Aug. 2 following its strong earnings.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases, which require a minimum of five weeks, have been especially common in recent months with the market grinding higher. Learn more about this super growth stock pattern.ASML Holding has a much simpler chart than Broadcom. The chip-equipment maker now has formed a flat base with a 155.83 buy point, trading tightly after peaking on July 27. ASML rose 0.5% to 154.22 on Friday.ASML's current consolidation follows a sharp, brief run-up from a prior flat base cleared on July 14, followed by a gap-up move on strong earnings July 19.Needless to say, ASML's Relative Srength line vs. the S&P 500 index is looking quite strong, continuing to hit new highs, a bullish sign.ASML in late July looked like it was going to be the first of many chip-gear firms to blast out of bases, but others faltered at or near entry points.Lam Research, like Broadcom, cleared a buy point (167.15), on July 26. Lam Research reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance that night, but but reversed lower from a record high (170) on July 27. Shares fell sharply enough to invalid that original entry and undercut their 50-day line, but shares retook that support level on Aug. 14. Shares fell 0.6% to 157.88 on Friday.On a weekly chart, Lam Research has a proper flat base with a 170.10 potential entry.Teradyne cleared a 36.69 consolidation buy point on July 26, after running up sharply from a July 4 low. But shares gapped down 6.6% on July 27 following its latest earnings report, despite beating views and offering a strong outlook.. Shares continued to trend down until Aug. 11. Teradyne now has a flat base with a 36.96 entry.

540,L,"Top-rated homebuilder stocks KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), MDC Holdings (MDC) and Pulte Group (PHM) all made IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Such institutional demand helps drive industry group rankings, so it's no wonder the Building-Residential Commercial group currently comes in at No. 8 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.While LGI Homes (LGIH) didn't make the latest list, it's also seen heavy institutional buying, as indicated by an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio. The stock closed higher for the 10th straight week, up nearly 8%.Tracking which stocks the top fund managers are buying is one key way to build a quality watch list. While it's no guarantee the stock will go up, it's a positive sign to know a mutual fund's research team and portfolio managers have done their due diligence and decided to invest.The table below shows how these leading homebuilder stocks stack up in terms of indicators that help you gauge institutional demand.After breaking past a 23.71 entry in a cup with handle, Pulte group is now extended, meaning it's more than 5% above the buy point and therefore out of a proper buy range.LGI Homes, NVR and KB Home are also extended, but the latter may be forming a new base.MDC broke out on June 28, but has seesawed in and out of the buy zone since then. It's now struggling — and so far failing — to find support at its 10-week moving average.Retaking that benchmark line in heavy volume would be a sign that fund managers and other large investors are stepping in to protect or add to their positions.Each of these companies recently reported earnings, except for LGI Homes, which is expected to release its latest quarterly numbers before the market open on Aug. 8.Analysts are looking for a 32% gain in earnings for the second quarter, compared to a 9% decline in earnings growth in Q1.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Top Fund Managers Buying – And Selling?Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

541,L,"The talking heads at CNN and MSNBC are positively giddy. Aha! A Russia connection. Donald Trump Jr. met with Russians! It's best when they can find a liberal guest to say what they're thinking, and they have plenty from which to choose.Here's a sentence of hyperbole from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., on CNN: ""I think we are seeing an unprecedented amount of contacts, personal, political and financial, that Trump, his family, his team, his business had with Russia prior to the election.""The use of the word ""unprecedented"" displays amnesia, or ignorance, or simply a rewrite of recent American history. Liberal journalists would like everyone to forget how then-President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee engaged in a blatant strategy to solicit illegal foreign contributions from Asian sources before the 1996 presidential election. Their contacts included Liu Chaoying, daughter of the senior commander of Red China's People's Liberation Army, who met with President Clinton.The Washington Post reported in 1998, ""Evidence gathered in federal surveillance intercepts has indicated that the Chinese government planned to increase China's influence in the U.S. political process in 1996."" Doesn't that sound like a precedent?After Clinton was easily re-elected, the DNC was forced to return more than $2.8 million in illegal or inappropriate donations. Almost 80% of that ill-gotten gain came from two sleazy Clinton-connected fundraisers, foreign nationals John Huang and Charles Yah Lin Trie. Few people remember this scandal because it was buried by those same news outlets that can't stop talking about Russia.It's not as if they didn't know, either.Twenty years ago this summer, Congress investigated this ""Asiagate"" plot while then-Sen. Fred Thompson's hearings produced one embarrassing detail after another about the Democrats. How did the press report these damning developments? They bad-mouthed the hearings as a waste of money and buried them under massive coverage of tabloid-ish stories of death — first, the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace in July, and then the accidental death of Princess Diana in August.By 2000, journalists had energetically forgotten the almost-cinematic embarrassments of 1996, like then-Vice President Al Gore's Buddhist temple fundraiser in Hacienda Heights, California. Buddhist monks illegally funneled about $65,000 to the DNC through straw donors at the instigation of longtime Gore fundraiser Maria Hsia. When newspaper accounts of this money laundering appeared, temple officials and Buddhist nuns altered and destroyed evidence. The TV networks yawned, even as Hsia was convicted on five counts.The Clintons were never chastened from exploiting foreign donors, moving them all into the influence-peddling orbit of The Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Even after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, the Clintons shamelessly continued their international contacts — ""personal, political, and financial,"" as the Democrats put it. The Clintons made an arrangement with then-President Obama's administration to disclose their donations from foreign governments — and then shamelessly violated it.When Hillary Clinton left office in 2013, a raft of foreign governments rushed to donate to the widely expected Democratic front-runner of 2016 — to ""save lives,"" of course, through the Clinton charities.The moment the foundation became a subject of scandal in 2016, foreign contributions dried up, and the Global Initiative was shuttered.While the national media currently obsess over a 20-minute meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a ""Kremlin-backed lawyer,"" we can guess that if the election had turned out differently, the Clintons would have turned their foundation over to Chelsea Clinton and made another raft of insincere promises about keeping any conflicts of interests at bay. Investigating her foreign contacts would be portrayed by journalists as a form of child abuse, or an early campaign against the next President Clinton.And now, back to Donald Jr. ...RELATED:As The Susan Rice Scandal Explodes, The Russia Election Hacking Story Gets MurkierMessage For @realDonaldTrump: It's Still The Economy, StupidReal Scandals The Trump-Obsessed Media Are Ignoring

549,L,"In an odd year for the homebuilding trade, most of the big-name builders have reported their quarterly results, and the housing market continues to struggle like a big dog on a leash.While no homebuilding stocks are currently listed on either the IBD 50 or the Sector Leader lists, a total of five homebuilding names have earned a spot on IBD's Your Weekly Review list: KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) and Toll Brothers (TOL).Your Weekly Review (see it in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) casts a slightly broader net for leading stocks, in terms of the vetting process, when compared to the other two lists. The process often turns up gems, but these must be researched with a bit more diligence that the more stringently screened Sector Leaders or IBD 50.Homebuilders stocks absolutely fit that profile.The 25 stocks collected in the homebuilding group turned in a collective gain of more than 48%  for the year through Friday. That has earned the stocks a steady top 10 ranking over the past 13 weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Track industry group charts and ratings like a pro using IBD's MarketSmith: a pro-grade arsenal of investment research programs and data. Also, see this Investor's Corner column on how to employ MarketSmith to spot early signs of large sector rotation and catch new breakouts among emerging growth companies.But the industry is turning in confusing data.Lennar (LEN) has now posted two quarters of earnings declines (-75% and -4%) despite accelerating revenue growth. Pulte Group (PHM) reported that earnings growth rebounded in its first and second quarters (from 18% to 29% and 27%), while revenue growth slowed (from 21% to 14% and 12%).The industry's largest name, D.R. Horton (DHI), reported that both sales and earnings growth slowed in its fiscal third quarter and its gains in new orders eased to 11.3% in a second-straight quarterly decline.M.D.C. Holdings reports Tuesday morning. LGI reports next Monday, and Toll Brothers has not yet announced a date for its fiscal Q3 report.The National Association of Realtors on Monday released stronger-than-expected numbers for pending home sales — houses under signed contracts, a gauge of upcoming sales activity for existing homes — in June. The more critical numbers to homebuilding stocks are sales of new homes.June new-homes sales inched up 0.8%, but growth was revised lower in March, April and May. Housing starts bounded 8%, building permits jumped 7% — both strong gains, but with the overall numbers remaining far below levels expected from a healthy market.We should be building total housing starts to 1.2 to 1.4 million, and we are only running at about 1.15 to 1.185 million,"" said analyst Jade Rahmani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""So there is about a 100,000-to-300,000-unit cushion of potential undersupply.""Why? Competition for limited land and labor is constraining the construction industry's output. At the same time, costs are rising — not just for labor and land, but for materials and services, including Canadian lumber, on which import tariffs of up to 24% were slapped in April, with another round reportedly on the way.The environment favors big homebuilders, Rahmani says.""We think the public homebuilders can take market share from privates, because they have better access to capital, and they can just tack onto their existing communities,"" he said.Rahmani favors Lennar and D.R. Horton over small- to mid-cap builders. These ""have the potential to face margin pressure as a result of increasing land costs and increasing building materials costs and labor inflation,"" Rahmani said.But recent gains in market shares have generally taken place below the level of the top 10 largest national builders, says Robert Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.""There has been some growth (in market share) among the top 20 share or the top 100 share,"" he said. ""The top 10 share has been roughly constant at about a quarter of home sales.""Results from small-cap builders M.D.C. and LGI Homes could be telling. Chartwise, M.D.C. remains in play after a brief breakout above a 36.09 buy point in a six-week flat base. Shares pulled back below the buy point, but stopped short of the 7% to 8% level that would trigger the automatic sell rule.The stock did break below its 50-day moving average in above-average volume. That is a sell signal, but not a hard-and-fast sell rule. That means the stock remains in play. A move back above the 36.09 level in heavy trade would mark a buy opportunity.Shares of LGI are extended after a third rebound from 10-week support since a breakout from a cup base in January.The Commerce Department reports July housing starts and building permits data on Aug. 16, and July new home sales numbers on Aug. 23.RELATED:Spotlight Countdown: 4 Buy Points, 3 Earnings Reports On The WayThis Homebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipNo. 2-Ranked Homebuilder Constructs Successful BreakoutThese IBD 50 Leaders Are Basing As Earnings Come Due

550,L,"A sudden, even shocking announcement came from President Trump's Twitter account on July 26. The government ""will not accept or allow ... Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity"" in the military due to ""the tremendous medical costs and disruption"" that entails.Whether you favor it or oppose it, and regardless of how this abrupt declaration blindsided the Pentagon brass, it's indisputable that the liberal media could not and would not approach this subject with anything resembling objectivity. Never mind that military men and women — and that's all we should care about — cheered the announcement. The press centered its coverage on the gender benders affected. They were unanimously offended and devastated, with no dissent allowed, no objection, no argument. Facts don't matter in today's news media. Emotional wallowing is mandatory.On the ludicrously titled (and would-be government-defunded, if Trump had his way) NPR newscast ""All Things Considered"" that night, anchor Kelly McEvers began by asking a ""trans man,"" former Air Force Reserve Senior Airman Jordan Blisk how it felt for former President Obama to lift a ban on transgender individuals in the military and have that be followed by the emotional impact of Trump's announcement. She asked, ""what consequences do you think that would have for trans men and women now?""Blisk saw only doom. He replied, ""that's going to devastate them from a career perspective, from a family perspective, from a financial perspective, from every single way because the military is everything to you when you're in.""And the hell with the other hundreds of thousands who serve and are offended.NPR marched through the one-sided drill all over again on July 30, with anchor Lulu Garcia-Navarro feeling the pain of ""trans man"" Army drill Sgt. Ken Ochoa. She declared: ""People who support having transgender people in the military say that the military is actually the biggest employer of transgender people in the United States. Is there a large community within the military? And how do you think that this could affect them?""Ochoa replied: ""I guess large is a relative term. I guess I'll put it this way. I know many more people who are trans that are in the military versus those who are transgender and not in the military."" NBC reported that an estimated 250 active transgender military members are currently in the pharmaceutical/surgical process of ""transitioning.""At The Associated Press on July 31, two reporters chronicled Germany-based Army Capt. Jennifer Sims (formerly known as Jonathan Sims) under the sensitive headline ""'I am transgender': A US soldier shares personal journey."" Sims wrote an email to fellow troops lamenting, ""So in the initial moments after the tweet, I saw myself forced into the state that I was in before I started transitioning — a state of depression, exhaustion and inability to enjoy things.""Sunday's New York Times carried a badly disguised opinion piece on page two from defense reporter Helene Cooper headlined ""When Soldiers Plead Their Humanity."" Cooper wrote, ""I suspect that in years to come, when I am recounting what it was like to be a Pentagon correspondent, I will remember far more the combination of hurt and defiance in the voice of a transgender American service member when I asked him how it felt to wake up Wednesday morning to a tweet from President Trump that he was no longer welcome in this country's all-volunteer military.""""Trans man"" Navy Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann told her, ""To know your own commander in chief doesn't support you is totally demoralizing."" In an almost mandatory turn at the Times, Cooper compared it to segregation in the South. It made her wonder what it would have been like ""asking black people what it was like to be told they were not equal to white people.""No one is allowed to call that comparison preposterous. Feeling pain alongside the gender-eviscerating left is all that ""journalism"" can muster. Call this what it is: ""propaganda"" and ""fake news.""

552,L,"As much as liberals say they despise ""fake news,"" some of the most powerful and notorious sources of fake news in America are the leftists in Hollywood. Their ""based on a real story"" manglings and stranglings of history are legendary, from Oliver Stone on down.The latest example is a new TV series that debuted July 5 on the FX cable channel called ""Snowfall,"" which is supposedly a look at the early days of the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles during the Reagan years. This ""history"" is based on the loony conspiracy theory that the epidemic devouring black communities was a CIA plot to fund the Nicaraguan Contra fighters.How many times must bunk be debunked? The CIA and Congress investigated these claims for years and found that while a couple of Nicaraguan exiles were dealing drugs in Los Angeles, they weren't associated with the CIA. There was no master plan of crack-fueled genocide.This isn't the first time Hollywood has pushed this fake news. In 2014, NBCUniversal-owned Focus Features released a movie called ""Kill the Messenger,"" which glamorized Gary Webb, a radical-left reporter for the Mercury News in San Jose, California, who spread this fiction far and wide in a 1996 series of articles called ""Dark Alliance."" As for the movie's title, in real life, Webb committed suicide in 2004 because he had no journalistic reputation left. That didn't stop Hollywood. Of course, America, on the other hand, showed good taste. The movie reportedly grossed only $2.4 million — a complete flop.So, here we go again with FX — a network owned by that demonized right-wing Murdoch family. The ""Snowfall"" plot focuses on a sleazy white CIA agent named Teddy McDonald who is acting on indirect orders from then-President Ronald Reagan's administration to use cocaine profits to fund arms for the Contras, which creates a crack kingpin in the process.Why would they sell this rancid baloney? You'd think if the Murdochs were going to bankroll a crackpot fake-news series, it would imagine former President Barack Obama being born in Kenya and now heading a secret Islamic cell to take over America.Washington Post TV critic Hank Stuever called out the FX producers for fakery, even as he professed he loved the series as entertainment. It ""could most use a disclaimer or some sort of helpful caution that you should view the series entirely as a work of fiction,"" he says.Stuever noted that the Washington Post, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times all poked huge holes in the ""Dark Alliance"" claims. These liberal papers would have enjoyed this horror story being true — but even for them, this was a bridge too far.Dave Andron, who created this series with ""Boyz N The Hood"" director John Singleton and Eric Amadio, isn't going to listen to the talk of disclaimers and fiction. He declared: ""It was a very conscious choice to start in South Central before crack landed. ... why was it allowed — if you wanna use that word — to continue, like why did it blow up, why was it so unchecked, why were the laws against crack cocaine so much more strict than powder cocaine?""They're talking about this show like it's almost a documentary. That's the way they want this program to affect the viewers, to build a tinfoil-hat army driven by racial paranoia. It neatly matches the way the left wants to organize a ""Resistance"" on the notion that President Trump and his supporters are all viciously racist, sexist, Islamophobic, etc., etc.It's important to expose fake news. It's also important to expose fake Hollywood.

556,L,"Polls out for Independence Day hit a sobering note: Our patriotic feelings are on a steady decline. Gallup found the number of people describing themselves as ""extremely proud"" Americans has dropped from 70% in 2003 to just 52% in 2016. Just 34% of Americans ages 18 to 29 picked ""extremely proud.""That's also demonstrated in the latest poll from YouGov, which finds that while 61% of people 65 and older describe themselves as ""very patriotic,"" only 20% of those under 30 describe themselves as ""very patriotic,"" while 35% said they were ""not very patriotic"" or ""not at all patriotic.""Could the days of ""Morning in America"" be over? Is Ronald Reagan's vision of a nation's embrace of her exceptionalism a thing of the past? There is no question that we are headed in the wrong direction.American exceptionalism is on trial, and one man is pleading for her to regain her senses. Mark Levin's new runaway best-seller, ""Rediscovering Americanism,"" somberly argues that the American experiment is over if the ""tyranny of progressivism"" is not defeated. The surveys showing such a dramatic decline in patriotism, especially among the young, indicate that the progressives are succeeding. Levin is calling for America to rekindle her exceptionalism -- a belief in the inalienable rights of man and the preservation of a system of ordered liberty through the rule of law.This is exactly the discussion the country should be having. It's also a discussion a big swath of America wants to have. Huge crowds are coming to Levin's book signings, and they're selling like hotcakes.Levin is correct to argue that our educational institutions, including the media and Hollywood, want everyone to accept that the progressives have won, and he'll have none of it. ""Rediscoving Americanism"" is a cogent plea to reject a federal leviathan, an all-encompassing administrative state, and return to a limited government based on the firm ground of the Constitution. It's a trumpet blast for liberty.Levin is offering precisely what progressives fear most: independent thought. In the age of liberal fascism, conservative ideas and conservative authors will not be allowed access to the airwaves -- including the taxpayer-funded TV and radio stations. They call themselves the ""mainstream"" media and preach the gospel of tolerance, but on both counts, the progressives are frauds.They will allow a discussion of public policy -- as long as it matches their worldview. Think Sen. Al Franken. He is no Mark Levin intellectually, but that's irrelevant. His book came out a few weeks ago, and he was the progressives' toast of the town, celebrated all over ""news"" shows, ""public"" TV and radio, and late-night comedy shows. The Washington Post and The New York Times rolled out 1,300-word rave reviews.But once again, Levin is being shunned by the thought police. Witness that though it's a runaway best-seller, now seven weeks consecutively, the establishment media have censored him completely, with not a single interview granted.

The Nasdaq fought to a 0.2% gain, and the S&P 500 — haltered by heavy losses from Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Universal Health Services (UHS) — managed a narrowly positive finish. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also made new highs before paring gains.Some of the day's most dramatic moves came from big caps, not just Boeing, but Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and AT&T (T). Akamai, United Health and Triumph Group (TGI) were on the casualties list.The Nasdaq briefly took a new high before trimming gains. The Dow took and held new high ground above 21,681. Small caps slipped out of their recent strong performance, with the Russell 2000 dropping nearly 0.6% after climbing 0.9% to a new high on Tuesday. The Russell remained positive for the week, up 0.6% and working on its sixth straight weekly advance.The Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold interest rates steady, and offered no signal that it had modified its stance toward an additional rate hike later this year, after increases in March and in June. The Fed also said it plans to begin reducing its $4.5 trillion in bond debt ""relatively soon,"" a process many analyst had not expected to begin until sometime in 2018.The major indexes had come off their highs well before the FOMC release, and mildly trended further lower after the 2 p.m. ET announcement. Gold Miners, appliance manufacturers and video game developers were the day's top-scoring industry groups. All stocks flying highest and lowest during the session moved in response to quarterly results.Boeing led both the Dow and the S&P 500, powering up 9% in massive trade. The stock was already extended from its most recent buy point, and Wednesday's move sent shares more than 25% above that entry.Leading chipmaker AMD pared its gain back to close 5% higher, after gapping up 11% at the open. It reported second-quarter earnings of 2 cents a share from a year-ago loss and a 19% jump in revenue, which topped expectations. The strong-volume move left shares in buy range above a 14.77 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Security brand Brink's (BCO) locked up a 14% gain for the day, easily taking out a new high on stronger-than-expected second-quarter results and a boost in full-year guidance.

558,L,"The Dow Jones industrial average was in the driver's seat again for the second straight session Wednesday, helped by a strong move by shares of Boeing (BA).The maker of commercial and military aircraft soared 9% after the company topped earnings estimates, while raising its full-year earnings and cash flow guidance.XBoeing was well-extended from a proper buy point headed into earnings. In fact, its rally has been so strong, it triggered an IBD sell rule that says to generally take profits in a stock when the gain hits 20%. The rule is there because after a stock rallies 20% past a buy point, it's usually around the time it starts to pull back in price and build a new base.With about one hour remaining in the session, the Dow was up 0.5%; the while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 added 0.1% each. Small caps lagged after a solid performance Wednesday, falling 0.3%. Volume was lower on the NYSE and slightly higher on the Nasdaq.The two-day FOMC ended today. The decision to keep interest rates steady at 1% to 1.25% was unanimous, and the Fed said the process of selling bonds to shrink its bloated $4.5 trillion balance sheet will begin ""relatively soon,"" perhaps as early as the September meeting.In the stock market today, technical breakouts for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments (TXN) looked good for a while but faded.AMD gapped up over a 14.77 buy point, rising 5% to 14.81, but the stock was near its session low after early strength. Ditto with Texas Instruments. Shares broke out early over an 82.91 buy point, but the stock was recently trading around 82.45, up 1%.Advanced Micro has the look of a turnaround story after the company reported its fourth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth.

TAL Education (TAL) jumped nearly 4% to 149.71 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close.

The stock pulled back on Friday to close down nearly 2% for the week.After a solid run from its April 27 initial public offering, Floor & Decor has been pulling back recently, but managed to close the week in positive territory. Given its fundamentals, including 96% average earnings growth over the last three quarters and 35% three-year annual sales growth, it's one to keep an eye on. For Q2, analysts expect a 260% rise in earnings-per-share.Alibaba has invested in fellow Chinese e-commerce stock Baozun, which analysts expect to deliver 400% earnings growth in its next report. The stock is already extended from an earlier breakout and was up over 13% this week.

But next year, Apple might make OLED screens standard with its new smartphones, according to a report Thursday by Nikkei Asian Review.The rumored iPhone 8 is expected to feature an OLED display, while two other new smartphones, which may be called the iPhone 7S series, will continue to use LCD screens, analysts say.Samsung is the only major supplier of OLED smartphone displays today and is believed to be the sole source of OLED displays for the iPhone 8. But other display manufacturers are building OLED production lines to take advantage of the expected shift from LCD to OLED displays in smartphones.Organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays offer richer colors, deeper blacks, a faster refresh rate and lower power consumption than current liquid crystal display, or LCD, screens. OLED displays also are flexible, allowing for new hardware designs.Apple is tentatively planning to release three new model iPhones with OLED displays in late 2018, Nikkei said, citing industry sources.Apple is in talks with LG Display (LPL) to invest in the South Korean display-maker's new OLED screen factory, the Korea Herald reported Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 73, meaning it has outperformed 73% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

But IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group has held its ground and is rated No. 3 out of 197 industries.LGI Homes helped lift homebuilders amid a broad market rally, with several housing stocks entering or near buy points.D.R.

574,L,"The radical leftist fanaticism over Rep. Steve Scalise's alleged shooter has been an integral part of the news coverage, as it should be. James Hodgkinson's ties to the Bernie Sanders campaign have been reported (if sometimes buried) by most news outlets, and the pundits are virtually universal in their belief that the socialist senator should not be held responsible.These journalists were about a quarter of a century late to the dance. Theirs has been a decades-long exercise in hypocrisy. If an act of violence could be blamed on a Republican or, even better, on a conservative, the press would do it, even if they needed to play a Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon-style game.Recall Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber. Some journalists like then-NBC anchor Bryant Gumbel immediately blamed ""right-wing radio jocks,"" naming Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Michael Reagan, Gordon Liddy and Bob Grant. He said, ""the extent to which their approach fosters violence is being questioned by many observers.""Think of the bombing of an abortion clinic in Atlanta in 1997. The anti-abortion movement was immediately put on trial and forced to defend itself against the media's charge that it was responsible. Ditto with the shooting of late-term abortion doctor George Tiller in Kansas.Consider the shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011. Right up to present day, the leftist media has cast blame on former Gov. Sarah Palin and her followers, even though the charge has been proven to be false.What about liberal Democrats? The media covered Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, because it was ongoing terror and they couldn't ignore it. But how many blamed the environmental movement for his radicalism, which included an embrace of then-Vice President Al Gore and his book ""Earth in the Balance""?Think of the endless exercises in destructive behavior perpetrated by Greenpeace and so many of the radical environmental organizations. Have the policies of the Democratic Party been blamed?What about the Black Lives Matter movement? The coverage has been intense and sympathetic no matter how much violence is perpetrated, smearing the police and causing a crime wave that has led to dramatic increase in murders. Has any Democrat, from former President Obama on down, been held to account? In recent months, the radical left's violence, and its call to violence by its leaders, has reached a frightening level because of President Donald Trump. But where have the news media been?Where were the news media at the Women's March on Washington when Madonna said ""f--- you"" to her detractors, and then proudly proclaimed, ""I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House""? ABC, CBS and NBC gave this large feminist event 129 times more coverage than the 2016 March for Life. ABC touted Madonna's ""A-list"" appearance and shamelessly censored any mention of her profanity or violent fantasies.In New York City, Shakespeare in the Park is running a rendition of ""Julius Caesar"" in which a very Trump-like Caesar is viciously stabbed to death. Where is the liberal media condemnation? ABC and NBC have mostly ignored it, while CBS has defended it for three minutes. CNN host Fareed Zakaria called it brilliant and urged the public to go view it. The New York Times is actually sponsoring Shakespeare in the Park, calling itself ""an institution that believes in free speech for the arts as well as the media.""Snoop Dogg is one of the hippest celebrities on the scene today. In a recent music video, he is depicted shooting a clown dressed as President Trump in the head. Do you recall any coverage? Any condemnation?The very bizarre rock singer Marilyn Manson also has a music video in which a facsimile of Trump is seen decapitated, blood everywhere, soon after Manson tears a Bible apart. Where was the coverage and condemnation?Before he was canceled, ""The Nightly Show"" host Larry Wilmore pledged to suffocate Trump. He said: ""I don't want to give him any more oxygen. That's not a euphemism, by the way. I mean it literally. Somebody get me the pillow they used to kill Scalia and I'll do it — I'll do it!"" He was previously honored by the White House Correspondents' Association to perform a ""roast"" (think toast) of Obama. Where was the coverage and condemnation of this ""joke""?There's been a lot of coverage of Stephen Colbert's gay slur of Trump. But do you recall him showing a depiction of Trump aide Stephen Miller's severed head placed on a spike a la ""Game of Thrones""?There is a legion of examples. The coverage has been virtually nonexistent. The condemnation has been nowhere to be found. It is well to remember this when considering the media's present outrage at the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise.Maybe, just maybe, they need to do some soul-searching themselves.

575,L,"L3 Technologies (LLL) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 65 to 72 Friday -- a welcome improvement, but still short of the 80 or better score you prefer to see. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their biggest price moves. See if L3 Technologies can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. L3 Technologies broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 180.05 entry from a cup without handle. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Earnings-per-share growth dropped in the company's latest report from 10% to 1%, but sales rose from 4% to 13%. Keep an eye out for the company's next round of numbers on or around Jul. 28.The company earns the No. 30 rank among its peers in the Aerospace/Defense industry group.

578,L,"America was stunned when Jared Lee Loughner pulled out a gun in a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket parking lot in 2011 and shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head at point-blank range and killed six others. No one recalls a TV pundit wondering whether the people should root for Giffords to survive — or anyone with the gall to imply her head wound was ""self-inflicted.""That was not the case with the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and four others last week. Outgoing ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Scott Pelley proclaimed, ""It's time to ask whether the attack on the United States Congress yesterday was foreseeable, predictable and, to some degree, self-inflicted."" Wrong. It was time for Pelley to evacuate the anchor chair.On Saturday morning, MSNBC ""AM Joy"" host Joy Reid brought on leftist Rev. Dr. William Barber so he could preach his usual sermon about villainous Republicans who ""crucify voting rights"" and enact other legislative evils. The MSNBC screen promised a ""Moral Moment.""Reid set up the reverend by saying, ""it's a delicate thing because, you know, obviously everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers."" She didn't stop there.She continued: ""But Steve Scalise has a history that we've all been forced to sort of ignore on race. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn't know what it was. He also co-sponsored a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage between a man and a woman. He voted for the House health care bill, which, as you said, would gut health care for millions of people, including three million children. And he co-sponsored a bill to repeal the ban on semiautomatic weapons. ... Are we required in a moral sense to put that aside at the moment?""This shameless program was supported by the following advertisers over the weekend: AT&T, Duluth Trading Co., Ensure, Purina, Crest, Gas-X, Infiniti and ZipRecruiter.The Twitter account for Reid's ""AM Joy"" show seconded her emotion, saying, ""Rep. #Scalise was shot by a white man with a violent background, and saved by a black lesbian police officer, and yet..."" A graphic listed his votes for the House health care bill, a marriage amendment to the Constitution and a repeal of the liberal gun control law.Common decency means we all hope and pray for the recovery of a public servant, as in the Giffords shooting. It's not the time to quibble about their same-sex marriage voting score. Greg Gutfeld on Fox said it best: ""Let me ask you this. A woman is raped. Do you feel compelled afterward to dredge up her stance on abortion or global warming?""NBC and MSNBC weren't going to address Reid's immoral moment. They had the audacity to skip over that and applied their outrage instead to a Republican PAC that made a disreputable ad for the Georgia special election. It refers to the shooting and alleges that the ""unhinged left"" applauded the shooting, and that the violence won't stop ""if Jon Ossoff wins."" Everyone can denounce that — and they did — as the other networks put the ad flap into heavy rotation leading up to the election.But Joy Reid's uncivil rudeness — do we have to root for Scalise to survive? — went unaddressed. All the networks that aired this ad, deplored it and declared it ""beyond offensive"" were the same networks that shamelessly publicized the false liberal claim that former Gov. Sarah Palin was somehow responsible for Gabby Giffords getting shot. Civility is never a two-way street for the left.

"
581,L,"When President Donald Trump makes an accusation of ""fake news,"" we could add a number of definitions of the term. Liberal journalists hear ""You write stories you know are fake."" But there are news stories that journalists earnestly put forward as real news that are based on a lot of suspicious methods — like quoting anonymous government officials indicting Trump in a malicious international plot to deny the ""real winner"" of the 2016 presidential election her prize.This is why the media elites will ignore the latest Project Veritas sting video in which CNN producer John Bonifield admits the Trump-colluded-with-Russia scandal is ""mostly bull---- right now."" But CNN keeps hoping it will turn out to be an enormously damaging scandal. Bonifield even volunteered that Trump was ""probably right"" to say it's a witch hunt.If all the leaking and all the speculating end up in a big pile of zero, how is it not ""fake news""?The latest study of ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from the Media Research Center demonstrates that the networks are obsessed with a conspiracy even Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters admit hasn't really been proved. Analysts watched every broadcast network evening newscast in the five weeks since the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller on May 17. They found a whopping 353 minutes of airtime devoted to the Russia probe, or 55% of all coverage of the Trump presidency during those five weeks.Nothing else even came close. Far behind in second place was the wailing about Trump pulling out of the Paris climate accord, with 47 minutes of airtime. In fact, liberal reporters mock the president's team for not being able to discuss infrastructure or tax reform ... at the same time they strenuously avoid them.It gets worse. A third of these Russia stories were based on anonymous sources, and too often they've ended up being the most obvious ""fake news."" For example, the night before former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, ABC's Jon Karl claimed that a ""source familiar with Comey's thinking"" insisted Comey would contradict Trump under oath about reassuring him he was not under investigation. In reality, Comey confirmed Trump's claims. Karl then reported that, too, but didn't acknowledge his earlier belly-flop.The best argument that liberals can muster about the large chunk of airtime devoted to this story is Trump's own tweets mocking the investigation, or as Time magazine calls them, ""dig-the-hole-deeper tweets."" They could claim that Presidents Bill Clinton or Barack Obama labored to shove scandals to the side of the news road with policy distractions or big meetings or trips or speeches, while Trump doubles down.But that also underlines how the media were eagerly willing to report those Democratic distractions, while they now obsess over anything that surfaces on Trump's Twitter account. The president knows that taunting them promotes another round of anguished news reporting, which perhaps underlines for his supporters that the ""news"" manufacturers prefer to present this president as some kind of hooligan disturbing the peace on the internet.What this study suggests once again is that the same reporters who effortlessly spread the fake news that Obama was ""scandal-free"" are dedicated to cementing the proposition that Trump is hopelessly scandal-plagued. The same journalists who shamelessly whacked away at Kenneth Starr as a modern knockoff of the inquisitor Torquemada are now presenting Robert Mueller as their latest echo of Eliot Ness. The only thing consistent about the press is their partisanship.RELATED:Real Scandals The Trump-Obsessed Media Are IgnoringThe Russia Worm Is Starting To Turn On Trump Conspiracy-MongersDid Obama White House And Loretta Lynch Illegally Meddle In 2016 Election?

584,L,"America is blessed with a diverse portfolio of energy resources. We rank first in the world in oil and natural gas production, No. 1 in nuclear power generation, No. 1 in renewable energy, and No. 2 in coal output.Indeed, abundant and relatively cheap energy provides much of the basis for our global competitive advantages. What's more, competition between fuels helps to hold down energy prices for households and businesses.In an ideal world, all energy resources would compete on a level playing field; but in the real world, energy markets are rife with subsidies. Perhaps the most egregious are those afforded wind and solar installations, currently receiving direct federal subsidies of about $12 billion per year in addition to a wide range of state and local tax breaks.Yet after more than 20 years of such largesse, wind and solar currently provide a mere 6% of the nation's electric power generation.Apologists for the renewable industry continue to claim that the oil and gas industry receives subsidies dwarfing those going to wind and solar. But they conflate ""tax deductions"" with ""direct subsidies."" Tax deductions for oil and gas aren't special favors but rather the standard relief afforded all manufacturers and mining companies to help recognize the costs of operations.By contrast, subsidies are a direct cash transfer from the government — i.e., taxpayers — to businesses.In any case, the roughly $3 billion per year in tax deductions taken by the oil and gas industry is a tiny price to pay for the huge benefits this sector produces for the economy and the $86 million in taxes the industry pays daily to the U.S. Treasury.Now the nuclear power industry, facing strong competition from less expensive natural-gas-fired generation, is begging for subsidies. For example, last year New York offered a huge subsidy to Exelon (EXC) to keep open two nuclear plants located upstate. The state Public Service Commission estimates that the subsidies will cost ratepayers at least $6 billion over the next 12 years. Ironically, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing ahead with his plan to shut down the Indian Point nuclear plant north of New York City by 2021.(Meanwhile, Exelon announced this week that it would close its Pennsylvania-based Three-Mile Island nuclear plant in 2019 because the state is refusing to make alternative-energy subsidies available. Pennsylvania has shown little political interest in subsidizing the Three-Mile Island facility, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979 that gained world media attention and set off a wide-ranging debate over nuclear safety).Illinois has also jumped into the nuclear subsidy game. Last summer, Exelon announced that, absent a rescue bill, it would close two nuclear plants by 2018. In response, the state legislature passed, and the governor signed, a bill in December that provides Exelon and Commonwealth Edison with a $235 million annual credit in each of the next 13 years.Not surprisingly, in February a group of Exelon's competitors filed a lawsuit against Illinois regulators claiming that the new state subsidy intrudes on federal authority over wholesale energy prices.Other states are joining the bandwagon. Nuclear subsidy legislation is currently being considered in Connecticut, a bill will soon be introduced in Ohio, and a subsidy scheme is being considered in New Jersey.Though advocates of nuclear subsidies claim that they'll only boost household electric bills by a few dollars per month, while ensuring that the state retains some of its ""zero emissions"" power generation, they neglect the long-term impact of higher utility costs on the state's businesses.For example, one recent study using a sophisticated input-output model found that higher power costs associated with Illinois' nuclear subsidy program would cost the state 43,000 jobs by 2030 and reduce state revenue by $420 million.Similarly, New York, already one of the most expensive states for operating a business, is likely to lose even more jobs in the years ahead as a result of its nuclear subsidies.Over time, consumers and businesses are best served by competitive power markets. This is why nearly two-thirds of the states have deregulated electricity and/or natural gas in recent years.Giving preference to one form of power generation over another through direct subsidies smacks of re-regulation and will invariably bring about higher costs for all electricity users.

586,L,"President Trump is back from his first foreign trip, and CBS ""welcomed"" him back by suggesting again that he can't possibly win a long fight with the media.On May 28, CBS reporter Errol Barnett quizzed ""Face the Nation"" host John Dickerson, saying: ""Trump is back to tweeting his unedited opinions this morning, telling people among other things, 'Many of the leaks coming from the White House are fabricated lies coming from the fake news media.' Are his supporters still buying that same excuse?"" Every politicized story loaded up with anonymous Trump-trashing government officials must be the gospel truth. It doesn't matter that people leaking these stories are unquestionably driven by a political agenda. Time and again, these leaked stories have collapsed. None of that matters.Dickerson replied in kind: ""His supporters that buy that line is a shrinking group. A lot of the things he's calling and has called fake news are now things that have either been supported by officials and members of both parties. The things he said were fake and made up are now the subject of a special counsel investigation. It`s hard to make the case that this is a fake set of inquiries.""This is the kind of weird logic that suffices in Liberal Land. A story is not fake if it's still being investigated. If we tell you it is raining and you set out to investigate that claim and it is sunny, is our story not fake because you're still investigating it? It's not a question of evidence as much as a question of political power and momentum. Ends justify means. Character assassination in order to diminish and hopefully eradicate the adversary is a good thing.Dickerson did not sound like this when the scandal involved Hillary Clinton. A year ago, he declared her private email server a ""stupid issue,"" a deflection from important policy matters like raising the minimum wage.The CBS host also wasn't going to be pressed by his colleague on whether all of these leaked stories turned out to be true or false. As we've noted before, the Washington Post had two anonymously sourced stories about former FBI Director Jim Comey that were deemed false: one about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offering to resign; and one about the FBI asking for additional resources for its search for Trump-Russia collusion. The acting FBI director testified under oath that the latter is not true.Democrats from Sen. Dianne Feinstein to Rep. Maxine Waters have admitted there is zero evidence so far of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government in a nefarious plot to ""hack the election.""But the unyielding spirit of the media was reflected in the ladies of ABC's ""The View"" begging former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to declare that Trump's impeachment is imminent. Rumsfeld said he hadn't seen any proof of collusion, and Joy Behar yelled back: ""If! If! If! If!"" Rumsfeld replied: ""Why would I want to 'if' that?""Despite their proclamations that they are the guardians of facts, the liberal elite wants to fast-forward beyond the evidence and see Trump's ruin as inevitable. Sentence first; verdict after. And after that, evidence ... if any.Former Gov. John Sununu told CNN there was no collusion, and it has looked for months now. When anchor Alisyn Camerota noted that ""We're at the beginning of the investigation"" because special counsel Robert Mueller has just taken over, Sununu asked, ""If Mueller comes out and says that my version is correct and yours isn't, how much crow are you going to eat?"" The media refuse to envision that strong possibility.The latest Washington Post story on senior presidential advisor Jared Kushner pushing the Russians for a secret back channel is falling apart. They'll be saying Donald Trump is making excuses again.

589,L,"Liberal media outlets like The New York Times have a political objective driving their coverage: Ruin President Trump.This is why the ""news"" producers treated former FBI Director Jim Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee as a Watergate moment, a first impeachment hearing to be broadcast live on every ""news"" channel on television. Liberals in Washington, D.C., took the day off and went to bars to celebrate the beginning of the end. The media celebrated the celebrations.When Comey admitted that he is a leaker, having used a law professor buddy to send his ""Dear Diary"" worries on President Trump to The New York Times, we at last had a poster boy for the Trump haters who were anonymously directing the narrative that dominated the media.Comey made it clear that he leaked to the Times in a successful effort to force a special counsel to investigate the unproven conspiracy theory of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton. Comey's leak also led to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia probe.This collaboration between leaker and media came into question when Comey was asked by Sen. Jim Risch about a front-page New York Times story on Feb. 15, in which it was reported that Trump aides ""had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials."" The writers noted, ""All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified."" Naturally.Comey told Risch it was false reporting. ""In the main, it was not true,"" he said. Longtime Washington Post reporter David Vise counseled, ""The Times might consider a correction of their own given Comey's testimony."" But the Times is refusing to admit error.Instead, it played cute on the day after the hearing. A blurb on the front page read, ""Article disputed: James B. Comey expressed doubts, without specifying, over the main elements of a New York Times article about direct contacts between Trump advisors and Russian officials."" Expressed doubts? Saying it's untrue isn't a doubt, any more than what the Times reports are ""facts.""On page A-21 of the Times was a one-column report vaguely headlined ""Disputing Times Article About Inquiry Into Russia."" What followed was a pile of excuses by the same three reporters who wrote the original erroneous report. They weakly claimed that any Russian might be called an ""intelligence official,"" since the spy agencies use private citizens.This might be an occasion to nudge the Times' public editor (or reader's representative) to investigate, but it just abolished Liz Spayd, and her final column came the week before Comey testified.The Times doubled down in a statement, saying, ""Neither the FBI, nor Mr. Comey would comment or elaborate on what Mr. Comey believes to be incorrect."" So the Times can take leaks from Comey and the FBI and grant them anonymity, but when its reports are challenged as untrue in front of millions of people, suddenly Comey's judgment is too vague to matter.As it launches anonymously sourced missiles from the front pages in its war on Trump, the Times and its liberal-media colleagues have sacrificed every notion of objectivity, and every notion of transparency. Now they are shredding the notion that accuracy matters to them more than their political agenda.

592,L,"It is said that America's armed forces have been stressed by 16 years of constant warfare, the longest such in the nation's history. For the Air Force, however, the high tempo of combat operations began 26 years ago, with enforcement of the no-fly zone in Iraq after Desert Storm. With an acute pilot shortage, particularly in the fighter pilot community, and with a shortfall approaching 4,000 among maintenance and staffing personnel, the service is, as Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson says, ""too small for what the nation expects of it.""At the Air University here at Maxwell Air Force Base, officers are studying what expectations are reasonable. Technological sophistication — America's and that of near-peer adversaries (Russia and China) — is changing capabilities. This, and the political and military primitivism of some adversaries (e.g., the Islamic State), are reshaping the environment in which air power operates, and the purposes of this power. The traditional U.S. approach to warfare — dominance achieved by mass of force produced by the nation's industrial might — is of limited relevance.Gen. Steven L. Kwast, president of the Air University, recalls that Gen. George Marshall, who in 1939 became Army chief of staff, asked a two-star general in the horse cavalry how he planned to adapt to the challenges of tanks and planes. The two-star, who replied that the horses should be carried to the front in trailers so they would arrive rested, was retired in 1942.Kwast notes that in 1940 the Navy was preparing to devote most of its budget to building the sort of battleships that had been ""kings of the sea"" since President Theodore Roosevelt sent the Great White Fleet around the world. After Pearl Harbor the Navy turned toward aircraft carriers and away from big battleships. Twenty years earlier, Gen. Billy Mitchell had used an airplane to sink a battleship, but changing the trajectory of military thinking, and hence procurement, often requires changing a service's viscous culture.Kwast wonders: What are the horses and battleships of our age? Some say: Aircraft carriers, because they are too vulnerable to long-range weapons and too expensive for the budget constraints of America's entitlement state. Also, some say, remotely piloted aircraft, aka drones, flown from, say, Nevada are many times cheaper than most manned aircraft, and are capable of loitering over a contested area to conduct ""find, fix, finish"" missions for up to 48 hours without refueling.When military air power was born a century ago, just before World War I, the hope was that it would save casualties by preventing what that war quickly became, a slog of attrition. But in World War II, air power was used to attack civilians in order to destroy morale and damage the enemy's capacity to wage industrial-era war. Now, says Kwast, war is shaped by the digital networked age, where power does not flow in industrial-age channels. U.S. forces can spend millions to kill one high-value target in Syria, where the enemy, for a few hundred dollars, can recruit 10 men who flow up from entry-level positions.Only the United States has the capacity to be, as retired Adm. Gary Roughead and Kori Schake say in a Brookings Institution study, ""guarantors of the global commons — the seaways and airways, and now the cyber conduits."" Nuclear weapons are still essentially a 70-year-old technology delivered by a 60-year-old technology, ballistic missiles. Before long there will be space-based sensors and directed energy (DE) weapons — war at the speed of light, 186,000 miles a second. It is preferable to shoot down an enemy's cruise missiles, which cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with space-, ground- and sea-based DE weapons rather than with defensive missile interceptors costing up to $20 million apiece.The Air University's military intellectuals are impressive enough to be forgiven for using ""architect"" as a verb: Hitler was defeated using great violence, but it would be better to architect responses to threats by projecting power in ways that are less expensive and much more efficient than even today's precision-guided weapons — never mind World War II gravity bombs, 80% of which fell at least 1,000 feet from their targets.Viewed from the not-too-distant future, Kwast says, today's Air Force, although it is a century distant from the Flanders trenches, might seem to have dug into the equivalent of trench warfare by operating below the altitude of 70,000 feet. Such thoughts are considered here at a university where ""trigger warnings"" and ""safe spaces"" are serious matters.

"
594,L,"In the wake of Kathy Griffin holding up a mock severed head of President Trump, it's disturbingly obvious that murderous thoughts about our leaders are now considered by the left to be light, humorous fare, a balm for their anxieties.It's not just Trump. The latest issue of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo arrived just before the British general election with a tasteless cover cartoon of British Prime Minister Theresa May holding her severed head in her arm. The title above translates to ""Multiculturalism the English Way.""It's why we're still with the hashtag #NeSuisPasCharlie.Griffin's assassination theme is also operating in a poorly disguised Trump version of ""Julius Caesar"" currently running as the ""Shakespeare in the Park"" production in New York City's Central Park. Caesar wears a business suit with an overlong necktie and a bushy reddish-blond haircut. His wife, Calpurnia, speaks with a Slavic accent.The Public Theater website describes this updated production by saying: ""Rome's leader, Julius Caesar, is a force unlike any the city has seen. Magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power. A small band of patriots, devoted to the country's democratic traditions, must decide how to oppose him. Shakespeare's political masterpiece has never felt more contemporary.""Artistic director Oskar Eustis seconded the emotion that Shakespeare's play was ""fresh and new"" in our modern age of apparent Trump tyranny, saying, ""The institutions that we have grown up with, that we have inherited from the struggle of many generations of our ancestors, can be swept away in no time at all.""In the central act of the original play, Caesar is stabbed to death. In this modernized version, an American flag looms over a bloody stabbing of Trumpy Caesar. One audience member, Laura Sheaffer, was shocked. As quoted by Mediate, she said: ""They had the full murder scene onstage, and blood was spewing everywhere out of his body. ... To be honest, I thought it was shocking and distasteful. ... I mean it was the on-stage murder of the president of the United States.""In the era of Trump, one man's distaste is the left's idea of class. The LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust (from the Publishers Clearing House magazine sweepstakes fortune) is the financial patron for all this assassination chic. American Express is the ""official card"" of this Trump-loathing gang.Everyone can guess what the reaction of the Manhattan-centered national media would be if this same play had been modernized with a charismatic black president and his fashionable wife with toned arms. The Safe Bet Department says this would never, ever happen in New York City. The Obama-loving press got a nasty case of the vapors when Rush Limbaugh merely wished his agenda would fail, and again when Sen. Mitch McConnell suggested Obama should be denied a second term. Imagine either of them condoning a fictional rendition of his assassination.But a bloody murder of Trump onstage upsets no one. The New Yorker passed right over it. The New York Times couldn't be moved. There were no spit takes on ""Morning Joe.""The socialist British newspaper The Guardian, last seen taking great umbrage that its reporter was shoved to the floor by a congressional candidate in Montana, described the play's Trump assassination plot as ""taking a somewhat lighter touch with their Trump resistance themes."" A lighter touch? Trump being stabbed like a pincushion? How droll!CNN Sunday host Fareed Zakaria raved about it on Twitter: ""If you're in NYC, go see Julius Caesar, free in Central Park, brilliantly interpreted for Trump era. A masterpiece."" That brings the whole Kathy Griffin theme around again. This is why Griffin felt her stunt would only make her more popular at CNN.

596,L,"Electronics firms paced a sharp decline in the tech sector and the Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes on Tuesday, down 1.6%.Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to early data, signifying a new distribution day, or unusually heavy institutional selling.XThe Nasdaq composite gave back more than half of last week's stout 1.9% gain. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, at least five electronics-related groups sank 1.5% or more, including semiconductor equipment, fabless semiconductors, contract manufacturing and chipmaking.IBD'S TAKE: Which were the best 10 industry groups in the market today? And the 10 worst? See the price changes of all 197 industry groups by viewing the entire ""Industry Sub-Group Rankings,"" available at Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.The S&P 500 slipped nearly 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. A rebound in department store, home furnishings retailing, jewelry, discount and variety retail, consumer lending, superregional bank, oil field services and hospital stocks helped cushion the blow.Investor demand for banks rose as the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond jumped 6 basis points to 2.20%. The sharp sell-off in bond prices came on the back of comments by Fed chief Janet Yellen that appeared to favor additional interest-rate hikes this year.The Dow utility average, also sensitive to interest rates, caved almost 1.4%. At 720.66, the sector gauge is still up an impressive 9.2% since Jan. 1.Investors who are sitting on large gains in the semiconductor sector need to keep a hawklike eye on sell signals or other indications that these leaders are ready to take a significant break.Lam Research (LRCX), KLA Tencor (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML Holding (ASML) are all leaders in the Chips sector, which through Monday's close ranked second among 33 IBD broad sectors; Electronics took the top spot.Lam, a member of the IBD 50, dropped more than 2.9% to 144.62 in heavy volume. The supplier of systems for wafer etching and cleaning slid further below its rising 50-day moving average. The undercut of the key support line is Lam's first significant move below that line since late April of 2016.Given Lam's big run over the past year, it's sensible now to take at least partial gains.Lam initially broke out of a long first-stage saucer-with-handle base at 83.61 in June 2016. After a slow start, the large-cap tech began to accelerate its gains and show heavy turnover in July through October of the same year. At its recent peak of 167.05, Lam gained as much as 99%.KLA, meanwhile, is also issuing a sell signal as it fell even further below its 50-day line. Shares dropped more than 2% to 93.8 and are now 14% off the 52-week peak of 109.59.Applied Materials, the $45 billion large-cap leader in IBD's semiconductor equipment group, also took out its 50-day moving average with a nearly 3% loss to 41.89 in volume that grew 25% above normal levels. ASML, down 1% to 132.37, is also testing its 50-day line.In IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group, Coherent (COHR) slid nearly 5% to 225.68 in fast turnover and gouged its 50-day line for the first time since October 2016. In the fabless semiconductor industry group, Broadcom (AVGO) fell 3% to 235.33 and is testing support at the intermediate-term support line for the second time since April.Elsewhere in the chip sector, thinly traded Power Integrations (POWI) bucked the widespread decline, rising nearly 3% to 74.90 after winning a supply deal from Apple (AAPL). Volume shot more than five times Power's 50-day average of 163,000 shares.Fund sponsorship in Power Integration, a small cap at $2.2 billion, has risen over the long term. At the end of the first quarter, a total 370 mutual and hedge funds owned shares, up from 319 in the year-ago quarter.Apple sank more than 1% to 143.74 in quiet volume. A further drop below the 50- and 10-week moving averages would affirm a pair of sell signals triggered two weeks ago: a sharp drop through these key support lines, and a round-trip of gains after Apple rushed past a 141.12 three-weeks-tight follow-on entry point.RELATED:Fed Chief Yellen Bullish On Banks Ahead Of Stress Test No. 2How To Track The Market's Prime Direction: What Does The Big Picture Say?The Easy Method To Spot The Most Important Stock Market TopsHow Are The Top Stocks Performing?

598,L,"How could Kathy Griffin think she didn't cross a line with her Islamic State group-beheads-the-president imitation? In a sense, her ignorance is understandable. Since Donald Trump was elected, there have been no lines to cross. Anything ... everything ... has been acceptable. The challenge has been not to temper the outrage but to push its limits. It was ""art,"" she claimed at first.Despite taping a video apology, she was dumped by CNN, which had promoted this ""comedian"" for 10 years as New Year's Eve entertainment in Times Square alongside Anderson Cooper. It tells you everything you need to know about CNN that up to this point, it had found her antics acceptable.CNN started putting her on air in 2007 after her award-acceptance rant at the Creative Arts Emmys during which she told Jesus Christ to ""suck it."" She cracked: ""A lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus.""Griffin has long used smears on conservatives and Republicans to boost her career. In 2010, she caused CNN stars John King and Dana Bash to laugh nervously as she described Sen. Scott Brown's teenage daughters as ""prostitutes.""When the outrage came, she boasted: ""Whenever a statement is issued against me, I'm in heaven. I feel my next special is half-written for me. And then I get to read statements allowed in my live shows which you can go to KathyGriffin.net and see the many, many cities I've picked up for my current tour.""Back then, the gossip site Radar Online was thrilled to describe Griffin's chat with an unnamed publicist for Playgirl magazine. The publicist said, ""I asked Kathy what star she'd like to see take a 'celebrity spill' and she said 'I'd like to push Sarah Palin down the stairs.'"" Griffin also claimed that Palin became John McCain's running mate by performing oral sex on him.The far left has coddled her, and, clearly, she thought she'd be the toast of the town for this mock beheading stunt. It didn't pan out that way. CNN host Jake Tapper denounced the stunt on air, and Cooper disavowed it as ""disgusting"" on Twitter. Almost everyone implicitly understood how the country would have greeted anyone ""artistically"" holding up a severed head of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.The vast majority of Americans were nauseated ... but not everyone. The delinquents at the leftist site Vox protested that Griffin and photographer Tyler Shields ""are resisting a rapidly shifting world in which women are losing access to basic reproductive health care.""Journalist Molly Ball of The Atlantic cynically denounced the Trumps on CNN for protesting this outrage, saying: ""I have a hard time bringing myself to care about something like this. I think it just speaks to the need to see themselves as a victim that they have, that they are constantly being persecuted.""Sen. Al Franken has refused to cancel a joint appearance with Griffin in July to promote his book ""Giant of the Senate."" The politician called it a ""horrible mistake"" but said, ""She's actually begged for forgiveness, and I believe in forgiveness.""Baloney. There is no real repentance here. Everyone knows that this was an apology offered to save her line-crossing business. The left wants her to cross the line to smash conservatives in the mouth. Incivility is the most satisfying kind of ""resistance."" Does anyone doubt she will return to her nasty routine once Franken & Co. get her ""back on her feet""?

601,L,"If you're looking for investment ideas — and who isn't? — why not check out top-performing stocks held by top-performing stock mutual funds?The top performing stock mutual funds, among those with more than $100 million in assets year to date through July 10, were those with portfolios in India, China, Asia and technology.XIt just so happens all were actively managed funds. And actively managed stock mutual funds outperformed their passively managed counterparts. Who says active stock mutual fund management is dead? More on that lower in this report.Let's go back to the best of the best among top-performing stocks.The $207 million Wasatch Emerging India Fund (WAINX) was the top performing stock mutual fund, jumping 37% year to date through July 10. It is actively managed. Among its best performing stocks were the ADRs of HDFC Bank (HDB), whose price rose 46%.The bank has more than 4,500 branches in nearly 2,600 Indian cities.HDFC sports a sterling 98 Composite Rating from IBD on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The stock is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.The bank is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Banks-Foreign industry group. Earnings per share rose 12% and 23% the past two quarters.

Its pretax margin was 27.8% last year, the highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of HDFC's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.The $107.9 million Neuberger Berman Greater China Equity Fund (NCEIX) was the second-best performing stock mutual fund — also an actively managed portfolio — with a 32.99% year-to-date gain through July 10. ADRs for Baozun (BZUN) were its top-performing security, notching a 121% surge this year.The company is an online provider of retail services. It helps Western companies like Coach (COH), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Nike (NKE) and Starbucks (SBUX) sell in China by creating their own branded, localized and customized online stores. As IBD recently reported, Baozun does not merely set up websites for corporate clients. It also helps Western brands decide what goes on sites by helping them understand Chinese consumers.Baozun's EPS jumped 167%, 200% and 75% the past three quarters.

And it is actively run.On July 10, the stock, which is a big Nasdaq component, edged past its 1,927.23 buy point of a flat base. But the stock closed below the entry on weak volume. Shares succeeded in breaking out the next day, although it was again on below-average volume.Despite headlines that insist that passively run stock mutual funds are trouncing actively run portfolios at every turn, actively managed stock mutual funds outperformed their passively run counterparts so far this year through July 10. Active stock mutual funds averaged a 10% gain vs. 9.60% for the S&P 500 and 8.94% for index funds.One reason for the outperformance by active managers is that far fewer index funds than actively managed funds beat the broad market.One thousand seven hundred and sixty-three actively managed stock mutual funds topped the S&P 500's year-to-date gain. Just 83 passively run stock mutual funds outperformed.That was outperformance by 51% of actively run stock mutual funds vs. just 33% of passively run stock mutual funds.Similarly, no index funds beat the broad market by as much as the best-performing actively run funds did.Among passively managed stock mutual funds with more than $100 million in assets, the top performer this year through July 10 was $106 million iShares MSCI Asia ex Japan Index (BAJIX), which gained 22.40%. One smaller fund, $11.42 million Leland Thomson Reuters Venture Capital Index (LDVIX), did better, notching a 28.89% gain.Twelve actively run stock mutual funds did better than the Leland portfolio. One hundred and thirty-three actively run stock mutual funds with more than $100 million in assets topped the iShares portfolio.Despite the strong showings by those two stock mutual funds, outperformance among index funds was mainly by emerging markets funds.After iShares MSCI Asia ex Japan, the next best performing index funds with at least $100 million in assets were seven emerging markets stock mutual funds, led by $2.1 billion TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Equity Index (TEQLX).ADRs of China-based TAL Education Group (TAL) are one of the TIAA-CREF fund's top performers, up 85% this year through July 10.

Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry. GM settled with a 1% gain at 35.86 in slightly above-average volume. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) cleared buy points Thursday, following a move by Ferrari (RACE) on Wednesday.General Motors' RS line has been lagging. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales have peaked, though a shift to SUV and truck purchases is supporting profits.Visa climbed to 96.65 intraday, a new all-time high, but not quite triggering the 96.70 buy point from a flat base. Visa reversed to closed down 0.25% at 95.94.Mastercard edged up 19 cents to 125.47, rising intraday to 126.40, briefly topping the 126.29 flat-base entry.Volume was below average for both Visa and Mastercard, but their RS lines are near highs, reflecting their strong performance and short consolidations.However, several other payment stocks have broken out this week, including PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).Visa has earnings next week, along with a few other card firms such as American Express (AXP), which is still in range from a June breakout.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial could provide insight into credit card trends Friday with their second-quarter earnings reports and conference calls.The chip-equipment giant fell 0.1% to 136.85. But for the second straight day ASML inched past a 137.37 buy point in a flat base going back nearly two months. ASML's RS line is near highs, a good sign.ASML will report quarterly earnings next week.PNC Financial is a superregional bank. It may be overshadowed by the money center banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, but PNC is expected to deliver a 10% EPS gain, while its larger rivals deliver essentially flat profit. PNC rose 0.1% to 127.38, as it builds toward a 128.35 entry in a shallow cup-with-handle base.JPMorgan is still in range from a double-bottom base, while Citigroup is extended. Wells Fargo is close to a buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern.RELATED:The Big Picture: Analyzing Apple's Stock; 3 Big Bank Earnings DuePeak Auto?

603,L,"X The stock market remained mildly lower at midday in the final trading session of May on Wednesday, as Goldman Sachs (GS) exemplified broad weakness in banking stocks.After tumbling in the first hour, indexes pared losses but were moving lower again at midday.The Nasdaq was down less than 0.3%. Alphabet (GOOGL) came less than a point away from the 1,000 price level, rising as high as 999.60 before backing off in busier trading than usual. The Google search engine operator is well extended from its 867.10 buy point and may be needing a breather.The S&P 500 also fell less than 0.3% and was trying to hang on above 2400, a level of prior resistance. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%.Small caps continued to underperform, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6% and as much as 1.2% earlier in the session. The Dow utilities rose 0.6% as that sector played its role as a defensive mechanism. SPDR Utilities (XLU), the largest utility ETF, was up 0.4% and still in buy range from a 52.33 buy point.Volume was running sharply higher compared with the same time Tuesday, an indication that institutional investors were dumping shares more than usual.Banking, energy and metals stocks led the market lower. Goldman Sachs fell below the 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months. The stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average, which has been trending lower. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating has dropped to D+ on a scale of A (heavy accumulation) to E (strong distribution).  It was the worst-performing Dow component Wednesday.When purchasing a stock, it's best to focus on those with an Accumulation Rating of C+ or higher, indicating that institutional investors on net are accumulating shares and showing healthy demand.Treasury yields eased on a couple of disappointing economic reports. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for May came in at 55.2, below forecasts for 57.5.  Pending home sales fell 1.3% in April, the latest in a series of soft reports for the housing industry. The Beige Book, another important economic indicator, comes out later during today's trading.U.S. crude oil slid 3.6% to $47.83 on worries of oversupply. Production in Libya is increasing, while U.S. shale output has been rising as well, reports said.TAL Education (TAL), one of the hot Chinese stocks and currently No. 1 in the IBD 50, kept sagging but is now making a test of support at the 50-day moving average. Watch for the stock to rebound at that crucial level. A drop below the line would be ominous.RELATED:What JPMorgan, Bank Of America Said That's Sinking Bank StocksFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksAnalog Devices Jumps On Big Q2 Earnings Beat, Raised OutlookTrump Set To Dump Paris Climate Pact, Risking Trade FalloutIs It Time To Buy Stocks?

604,L,"Like Pavlov's dogs, the liberal media salivated over the arrival of former President Barack Obama to receive the Profile in Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. The mythic figure returned to accept the honor in the middle of a two-hour live special on MSNBC, loaded with the usual Chris Matthews slobbering over his ""American eloquence.""The words ""mythic figure"" truly apply, as another liberal historian has now underscored just how much ""fake news"" Obama manufactured on his way to the highest office in the land and the lucrative beyond.In his 2012 book ""Barack Obama: The Story,"" Washington Post associate editor David Maraniss exposed Obama's memoir, ""Dreams of My Father,"" as stuffed with false anecdotes. The author later recalled that when Obama objected, saying, ""David, you called my book fiction,"" he replied: ""No, Mr. President, I actually complimented you. I called it literature.""This time, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Garrow — best known for thick volumes on the life of Martin Luther King Jr. — is the author insisting that Obama's memoir is a work of historical fiction in which the ""most important composite character was the narrator.""In his book ""Rising Star"" — a real doorstop of a book at 1,460 pages — Garrow concluded that Obama's ambition devoured his progressive idealism. ""While the crucible of self-creation had produced an ironclad will, the vessel was hollow at its core,"" he says.Washington Post nonfiction book critic Carlos Lozada drew attention to a new character in the real life of Barack Obama: a woman who Garrow reports Obama asked to marry him. Sheila Miyoshi Jager is of Dutch and Japanese ancestry and now teaches at Oberlin College. In Obama's memoir, she ended up blurred into the composite white women he dated. You can't find her name in other Obama biographies either. How on Earth is it 2017 and no one in the media uncovered this simple yet significant fact?There's a simple answer: Obama didn't want them to, and no one in the ""objective"" press displayed much interest in correcting his self-serving legend.Garrow suggests that Jager originally said no in 1986 because her parents thought she was too young, but she says Obama grew ambitious and began to talk to her about being president one day. Her race would complicate that journey. Garrow cites Illinois Sen. Richard Newhouse, an African-American who was married to a white woman and dogged by whispers that he ""talks black but sleeps white."" One-term African-American Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, whose ex-husband was white, admitted that ""an interracial marriage really restricts your political options.""So Obama went to Harvard Law School. One former classmate of his told Garrow, ""the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up."" He reported that classmates created an ""Obamanometer"" to measure ""how pretentious someone's remarks are in class."" But in fact, Obama was elected as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, which drew a gushing New York Times piece in 1990 — the first of many.Not everyone in the liberal media was receptive to Garrow's revelations. New York Times chief book critic Michiko Kakutani ripped it for having a ""highly intemperate epilogue ... which almost reads like a Republican attack ad."" The book ""devolves into a condescending diatribe unworthy of a serious historian,"" she says. Horrors.The book was ""way more exhausting than exhaustive."" The epilogue was painted as ""filled with bald assertions and coy half-truths."" As for Obama's outright lies and evasions, Kakutani offered the conclusion you might expect from a political party commissar: For reliable history, ""Go back to Obama's own eloquent memoir,"" she says. In other words, ""the myth shall set you free.""

607,L,"In reaction to the May ratings report showing MSNBC as number one in weeknight prime-time viewership in the prized 25-to-54 age demographic, CNN sent out a spokeswoman to separate itself from the competition. CNN should be viewed as ""the one nonpartisan cable news network,"" presumably unlike MSNBC, and certainly unlike Fox News.This statement was issued after CNN personality Kathy Griffin did a stunt holding up a replica of President Trump's bloody severed head. It's doubly shameless that it also came after CNN host Reza Aslan raged at the president on Twitter, calling him ""this piece of s---."" CNN responded to the Griffin horror by canceling her annual New Year's Eve appearance. Aslan, on the other hand, didn't seem to bother that much; CNN lamely sent out a flack saying, ""Reza Aslan is not a CNN employee"" — as if this were to mean anything.Aslan ""apologized"" by insisting ""that's not like me"" to respond in such a ""derogatory fashion."" That is untrue. The Twitchy site and other Twitter searchers quickly found a long list of examples of Raunchy Reza. He called Trump a ""POS"" — how polite to abbreviate it — on May 17 in response to a Huffington Post article, saying, ""This is precisely the bull---- that led a record 81% of WHITE evangelicals to vote for a greedy lecherous racist pathological lying POS."" On May 9, he called Trump a ""lying conniving scumbag narcissistic sociopath piece of s--- fake president.""Who is Reza Aslan? Go to CNN's website. You'll learn he hosts ""Believer With Reza Aslan,"" a ""spiritual adventure series."" You'll be told Aslan is a ""renowned author and religious scholar."" What you won't be told is that Aslan is a Muslim leftist activist who wrote an insulting book about Jesus Christ called ""Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth."" He recently gave a lecture at the University of Pennsylvania titled ""Fear Inc.: Confronting Islamophobia in America."" What you also don't see is how vile this ""religious scholar"" can be on social media.
"
608,L,"He reviewed President Trump's first trip abroad, saying, ""But on the plus side he didn't s--- himself in public.""After Greg Gianforte won a House seat after allegedly assaulting a liberal reporter, Aslan mocked Vice President Mike Pence's congratulatory tweet by saying, ""And Jesus said, 'if someone tries to ask you a question, beat the s--- out of them.'""He responded to a Happy Mother's Day tweet by House Speaker Paul Ryan that said, ""Happy #MothersDay to my mom & all moms who do whatever it takes,"" by screeching, ""Except of course Syrian moms fleeing war, famine, and genocide with their starving children. F--- those moms.""While responding to a tweet by author and Barack Obama critic Dinesh D'Souza, he fired off: ""Hey Dinesh. I'll say this as politely as I can: Go f--- yourself, you adulterous piece of sh-- felon.""That was similar to a tweet he issued imagining what Gold Star Father Khizr Khan's wife would say to Trump if they were to speak after he criticized her at the Democratic National Convention. ""She'd probably tell you to go f--- yourself,"" he said.He really doesn't like conservative Republicans. He said in August 2012: ""Just to be clear I was indeed wishing someone would rape congressman Todd Akin. I'd hate to be misunderstood.""After uncorking these vicious and profane tirades, CNN cannot plausibly keep this man on the payroll and say it's ""the one nonpartisan cable news network,"" or a haven for civilized discourse.

609,L,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average rose early Wednesday ahead of Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Investors will be looking for more hints about when the Fed will start whittling down its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, the Dow closed flat and the S&P 500 fell 0.1%. Three chip plays are now close to buy points: Apple (AAPL)-supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and chip-equipment makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML Holding (ASML).XIt's important to see these chip stocks faring well. All three are highly rated, and if the market is going to find its footing and go much higher it will need top stocks to lead. Chip stocks overall were among the biggest losers in the recent tech selloff, so it's good to see them bounce back. That's especially true because chips are in the guts of just about tech product, from the Apple iPhone, data centers, auto electronics and just about everything else. If chips are doing well, that's a good sign for end products.Several other chip stocks are acting constructively, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Lam Research (LRCX). Nvidia never even fell below its 50-day line, but both Nvidia and Lam Research need to consolidate longer to form proper consolidations after their relatively large sell-offs in June.Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.3% vs. fair value. The Dow industrials climbed 0.2%. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5% vs. fair value.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei slid 0.5% and China's Shanghai composite 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE rose 0.9%, Germany's Dax 0.7% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.The Apple supplier was one of the better-performing chip stocks from the June 9 tech reversal. Shares fell sharply on June 9, but Broadcom held its ground for the next few weeks. Finally on June 29, the company fell below its 50-day moving average. It retook that level on July 7 and has found support at that line, though the recent rebound hasn't been on strong volume. Broadcom is now in a flat base like many other stocks, including Apple, ASML and Applied Materials.Shares dipped 0.4% to 240.89 in Tuesday stock market trading, about 6% below a 256.88 buy point.(Apple for its part rose 0.3% to 145.53 but is still below its 50-day moving average, which is now leveling off. Apple is about 7% off a potential 156.75 entry.)Broadcom has a Composite Rating of 96, which means that the stock outperforms 96% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Big stock winners through history have often had a Composite Rating of 95+ near the start of their big price moves.ASML Holding is in a flat base going back to May 16, with a possible entry at 137.37. The Dutch maker of lithography systems tumbled below its 50-day line on June 9, where it largely stayed through July 6. But on July 7 shares just retook that support area. ASML continued to climb, including a 0.75% rise to 135.82 on Tuesday.ASML will report second-quarter results on Wednesday, July 19, before the market open.ASML has a Composite Rating of 96.Applied Materials, another big maker of chip equipment, rose 2.7% to 45.40 on Tuesday. Applied Materials climbed 1.5% on Monday, retaking its 50-day moving average after advancing 3.4% on Friday.Applied Materials is about 5% off a flat-base consolidation buy point of 47.96.Applied Materials has a best-possible 99 CR.RELATED:Chip Stock Upgraded To Buy On Apple, Tesla Contract WinsApple iPhone 8 Expectations Too High, No 'Supercycle' Ahead: AnalystStocks Shake Off Trump Emails; These Key Events Could Move MarketYellen May Trigger Stocks, Banks; Amazon Reviews: Investing Action Plan

613,L,"You would think Republicans at least would have recognized the problem. But bipartisan legislation is now on the fast track in both the House and Senate to create new, exclusive, federal regulatory power over the sale of hearing aids.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would administer the new regulation, which would apply to lower cost hearing aids that could be sold over the counter for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The legislation would pre-empt all state regulation of such hearing aid sales.The FDA already rules over a vast empire of crony capitalism corruption. That involves regulatory favoritism granting monopoly market power yielding billions for those paying the right lobbyists (such as former FDA employees). But millions at least in corporate shakedowns for those who don't.This grows out of the nature of the pharmaceutical industry itself. The drug companies devote themselves to developing nonnatural substances for use in medicine. That is because natural substances that can already be found in the environment as a general rule cannot be patented.The regulatory process compounds the problem. Getting a new drug approved by the FDA routinely costs over a billion dollars. Only a medicine protected by a government patent can attract investors willing to finance that.There is so much money at stake in such FDA drug approvals and associated patents, this process creates a climate of corporate favoritism and corruption. There are billions at stake for the drug companies. Millions more for their lobbyists, often former FDA employees themselves. Current employees have ties to these former employees, and may often plan to cash in themselves someday.This climate carries over into the post approval environment. The FDA seems to feel it must protect the investment market for drug development. So it will discourage, slow walk, foot drag and even outright ban potential competition to drugs once approved. When the FDA approved anti-depression drugs based on expanding and prolonging serotonin inside the body, it soon banned L-Tryptophan, a less expensive natural substance that also increased serotonin, then widely in use.This policy translates into a generally hostile attitude to supplements, or natural alternative medicines. The FDA will not allow claims that these natural cures can be used to treat illness, regardless of the science supporting such claims, unless the supplements are submitted for the enormously expensive FDA approval process. But the FDA knows that such natural medicines that cannot be patented cannot raise the investment for such expenses.Colchicine has been used as a medicine for over 3,000 years, to treat gout and similar diseases. But it was not until 2009 that the FDA approved the modern, refined, derivative Colcrys to treat gout and Mediterranean fever. It did so by granting an exclusive marketing agreement to one company in exchange for contractual pledges to conduct more studies, and a $45 million application fee to the FDAGeneric drugs that compete directly with FDA drug approvals and their patents generally get the cold shoulder, even after patents have expired. The FDA requires proven generics to submit to expensive bioequivalence testing, demonstrating that it is bioequivalent to the original approved, patented drug, even when it buys the same raw materials from the identical supplier for the brand name drug.Such bioequivalence studies require human trials taking nearly two years to complete. This is one reason why 1,900 different generic medicine applications are still pending action by the FDA, with an average approval time of more than 26 months.Crony capitalist regulatory favoritism exploded into public view in the EpiPen controversy. That involves a device for safely and effectively injecting epinephrine into those suffering severe breathing blockage threatening imminent death due to an extreme allergy to bee stings, certain foods, or drugs. The price of a package of two EpiPens soared from $100 in 2007 to over $600 by May, 2016 as the FDA blocked competition to manufacturer Mylan.The newly proposed now pending legislation would create obvious new opportunities for FDA crony capitalism abuses in determining which hearing aids could qualify to be sold over the counter, which address mild to moderate hearing loss, and which qualify as ""low cost.""One leading Senate co-sponsor is Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a self-styled ""progressive"" who can never imagine the government doing any wrong with more power. The same goes for leading Democrat House sponsor Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. But leading Senate Republican co-sponsor Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and House Republican co-sponsor Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., should know better.

614,L,"Situational ethics define the liberal media. There is no pursuit of truth. There is only a double standard.When former President Barack Obama bowed to dictators in Cuba and Iran, it was ""historic"" diplomacy. When President Donald Trump talks up meeting with autocrats, that's another dangerous and disgusting sign of his lack of respect for human rights.The Washington Post front page on May 2 carried the headline ""Praise for strongmen alarms rights advocates: Trump's vocal affection for totalitarians marks major U.S. policy shift."" Pictures included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and the crackpot North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.So, what was different when President Obama launched a Russian ""reset"" with Putin? And when Obama praised Muslim Brotherhood tyrant President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, that was smart? Did the Post freak out on the front page in 2008 when then-presidential candidate Obama stared down Hillary Clinton and said he would talk to dictatorial regimes, that refusing to talk is ""ridiculous""?You won't find a Washington Post headline on ""Obama's vocal affection for totalitarians.""What about the media's happy talk for murdering brutes? Go back a few months to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's death. ""Revolutionary remade Cuba,"" read the Post headline. The obit gushed that he was ""a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots"" and a ""spiritual beacon for the world's political far left."" The New York Times preferred to describe him as ""the fiery apostle of revolution.""Do we really need to revisit the media's opportunistic tendency to kiss dictatorial rings to gain access for softball interviews? Should we have to recall Scott Pelley celebrating the ethics of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Dan Rather babbling to deposed Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein or 20 different anchors lauding Castro to his face?Nevertheless, CNN anchorman Jake Tapper opened his show on May 1 with blazing snark, saying: ""The world according to Trump: Journalists are the enemies of the people, but he would be honored to meet Kim Jong Un. ... President Trump today saying he would be honored to meet where North Korea's despotic dictator under the right circumstances. And that is not the first maniacal and murderous strongman he has opened up to in the past day.""Trump called the North Korean tyrant a ""pretty smart cookie"" on Sunday, and Tapper offered a rebuttal, saying: ""Kim Jong Un had his uncle murdered. That doesn't make Kim Jong Un a smart cookie. That makes him a murderer.""This on the network that confessed it squashed tales of torment and murder for years in order to keep its Baghdad bureau open, to distribute only ""news"" that was acceptable to that great humanitarian Saddam Hussein.Here's another CNN blast from the past. In June 1994, former President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang and hugged North Korean despot Kim Il-Sung. CNN anchor Frank Sesno summarized it, saying: ""Jimmy Carter, Korean peacemaker! Did his trip to Korea reduce the threat of war?"" Carter even called the Stalinesque dictator the ""Great Leader"" without getting scalded.And let us not forget CNN was founded by Ted Turner, who did embarrassing interviews with ""murderous strongman"" Fidel Castro and broadcast a documentary in 1988 called ""Portrait of the Soviet Union"" that fawned over the Communist revolution with lines like this howler: ""Once, the Kremlin was the home of czars. Today, it belongs to the people.""Tapper concluded his commentary by quoting Ronald Reagan, saying that ""a violation of human rights anywhere is the business of free people everywhere."" That sounds great. But that same press fought Reagan tooth and nail in his day, assaulting him for being a crazy Red-baiting warmonger for statements like that.It's good for journalists in free countries to question leaders about their commitment to advocating human rights instead of pragmatically enabling dictators. Unfortunately, our media display a reflexive habit of questioning only Republican presidents. The Carters, the Clintons and the Obamas skate free.

617,L,"Sen. Al Franken has a new book out humbly titled ""Al Franken: Giant of the Senate."" On that same level of attempted humor, his biography states he received ""his doctorate in right-wing megalomania studies from Trump University."" Stay classy, Sen. Franken.Sycophantic press profiles of Franken express admiration for the ""former comedian"" as if the satire stopped. Just two months ago, the Washington Post gushed: ""the former comedian and satirist may be having a breakout moment as a political star. ... The Minnesota senator spent the last eight years proving that he's good enough, smart enough, and doggone it, people like him.""The Democrats who support the Post swoon at Franken's feet, but if you're conservative, you can see he's a serious jerk. On May 24, the Post puffed him again in the style section gossip column under the headline ""Al Franken is back to writing jokes with this sick burn on Ted Cruz.""So what was this ""sick burn,"" this masterful insult? Franken wrote about how before the Gridiron comedy dinner in Washington, D.C., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., asked Sen. Ted Cruz to listen to her Cruz-bashing joke that played off the 2013 Carnival ""poop cruise"" story about the ship with sewage seeping into the halls. Klobuchar joked: ""When most people think of a difficult cruise, they think of Carnival. But we Democrats in the Senate think of Ted."" Franken burst in on this conversation with his own rewrite. He said: ""When most people think of a cruise that's full of s***, they think of Carnival. But we think of Ted."" Cruz didn't smile.The Post wrote: ""Now that's a burn."" This is the same newspaper that cartooned Cruz's young children as organ grinder monkeys, so we guess it can relate to Franken.Franken devotes a whole chapter of his book to running down Cruz, who told Politico: ""Al is trying to sell books, and apparently he's decided that being obnoxious and insulting me is good for causing liberals to buy his books. I wish him all the best."" By contrast, Franken reportedly wrote in the chapter that he considers Cruz ""singularly dishonest"" and ""exceptionally smarmy."" The gentleman from Minnesota told USA Today's Susan Page, ""You have to understand that I like Ted Cruz probably more than my colleagues like Ted Cruz, and I hate Ted Cruz.""Why be Franken's friend? Page relayed that he became pals with then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Jeff Sessions and their wives became friends. But when Sessions was nominated for attorney general, Franken told Page, ""When my job meant doing everything in my power to deny my friend this important position, I was relieved there was so much to demonize him for.""Cruz and Sessions are demonized by the ""objective"" national press for pressing their constitutional conservative agenda. But Franken can be as vicious as he wants and supplicants like Page write sentences like this: ""His relish for debate and his full-throated liberalism is a good fit with the rising anti-Trump energy among Democrats on the left.""This is why conservatives roll their eyes when liberal journalists lecture about the need for civility. They adore Franken's bilious nastiness as ""full-throated liberalism"" but freak out when someone uses Barack Obama's middle name. Their judgment of civility is as well-honed as their judgment of ""news."" It's all about whose ox is being gored.

619,L,"On May 14, CNN host Fareed Zakaria offered a fiery secular Sunday sermon declaring that President Trump is a ""danger to American democracy"" and guilty of ""gross violations of the customs and practices of the modern American system,"" and that only the news media can ""keep alive the spirit of American democracy.""On Monday, the Washington Post offered another arrogant serving of the media's idea of ""democracy"" and ""news."" It loaded up a story full of anonymous ""current and former U.S. government officials"" with the headline ""Trump reveals secret intelligence to Russians: Highly classified information on ISIS.""Trump's national security team denied the Post story, which, as usual, doesn't do a bit of good. The media instinctively disbelieve everything Team Trump has to say. If the Post account is correct and the president compromised intelligence operatives and damaged alliances to impress the Russians, that is not just noteworthy — it's TNT. But what exactly did Trump disclose?Once again, we don't know what. We don't even know if. How many times must we attend the same movie? As we've seen so many times since Trump became president, these are anonymous leaks coming from nameless, faceless people whose motives might be pure but could be poisonous.One thing we do know: If news is defined as a quantifiable event, this isn't ""news.""In the current hothouse environment, with liberal media that define Trump as the antonym of democracy, the public should be wary of anonymous sources. This is especially true today. Newspapers that crusaded against Trump in their pages — both news sections and editorial pages — simply cannot be trusted. Theirs is not the pursuit of truth; it's the hunt for Donald J. Trump's scalp.Earth to the Post: Your new motto is ""Democracy Dies in Darkness,"" but anonymous sourcing is darkness. Every source who hides behind a wall as he tries to ruin other people's careers is a self-serving coward with a personal or political ax to grind. Without knowing an identity, the public has no way of telling anything. It's idiotic for the press to demand transparency in government at the exact same time it rewards government officials who refuse to be transparent themselves.Journalists pat themselves on the back that they would never be ""stenographers to power,"" but they're worse than that now. In their zeal to destroy Trump, they've become stenographers to anonymous power.It's also a pattern. Since Trump won the election, the Post has been caught in a string of over-aggressive anti-Trump stories that were based on anonymous sources and turned out to be untrue. Just last week, the Post reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offered to resign in the wake of the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Rosenstein denied ever doing such a thing. The Post also reported that the FBI asked for additional resources for its probe of possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. The acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe, testified under oath that the report was not true. It's a shame Congress doesn't get to put the media's anonymous sources under oath.There's an obvious reason why the public holds journalists in low esteem and rejects the notion that they are watchdogs of government. Journalists are not trying to serve the voters with objective information. They're constantly trying to push, prod, shame and trick voters into their own political agenda, using whatever convenient information, misinformation or disinformation will serve their cause. As one consumer put it, they don't like how the press facilitates ""government acting like the Wizard of Oz,"" being all full of frightening bluster from behind a curtain.The media have something to hide. If we knew all the party affiliations, political contributions and secret agendas of their anonymous sources, it might be even more obvious that their reporting is much more advocacy than journalism.RELATED:Democrats Desperate To Turn Trump Into NixonWhy Trump Was Dead Right To Tell Comey: 'You're Fired'No, Trump's Top-Secret Whispering To Russians Isn't Fake News — But It Is A Fake Issue

620,L,"In January, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey told a Television Critics Association session in Hollywood that she wanted to retool ABC programming to include more shows for Trump-voting segments of the population: men, rural America and working-class families.""If we're talking about diversity and inclusion, I want to make sure we're inclusive of everyone,"" she declared. ""When you think about the name, we're the American Broadcasting Company.""We've seen this movie before. The commitment to wholesome values is perhaps the emptiest statement in Hollywood.This month, she broke that campaign promise like a politician by canceling the Tim Allen sitcom ""Last Man Standing,"" a show appealing directly to that Trump electorate. A Change.com petition protesting the move has nearly 300,000 signatures. Allen tweeted that he was ""stunned and blindsided"" by the bad news.Why was Allen fired?The show didn't have a ratings problem — it averaged 6.4 million viewers this season, and that should be graded upward on a curve, since the show aired on Friday and the overall Friday audience is typically smaller than other weeknights. Dungey said the job of a programming executive was ""managing failure,"" but this wasn't a failure. ""It was a steady performer,"" she admitted. However, she added, ""Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of that's where we landed.""Instead, they're moving in the drama ""Once Upon a Time,"" which averaged 3.2 million viewers this year, or half of Allen's number. In the second hour, ABC is eventually placing its show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" which this season averaged 2.3 million viewers.What about Saturday to Thursday? Apparently, there wasn't a slot on ABC prime time for Allen's show.What constitutes a success at ABC? Dungey declared herself ""optimistic and excited"" about a third season of ""Quantico,"" which, according to creator Joshua Safran, is opposed to ""Trumpian instincts."" The series just concluded with a plot that the Trump-like president wanted to merge the FBI and CIA into one giant agency and was exposed as a tool of the Russians. And the ratings? This cartoonish liberal claptrap averaged 2.7 million viewers this season, just over a third of Allen's total. It was renewed.These surviving shows with mediocre ratings are owned by ABC. That means there are business reasons for Allen's show to be dismissed, since it's owned by 20th Century Fox. But it's the second-highest-rated ABC sitcom behind ""Modern Family,"" which is also owned by Fox. (This season, it was ABC's third most watched scripted series behind ""Modern Family"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."") But ABC is keeping Fox-owned ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" which on Tuesday night drew less than 4 million viewers. Pro ""diversity"" ABC wasn't going to cancel an Asian-American sitcom — one with an episode last November during which a character proclaimed, ""This country was founded by illegal immigrants,"" meaning the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock.ABC also claims it is renewing these less-popular shows due to ""critical acclaim,"" and that's one way Hollywood liberals can cite liberal TV critics in defense of their decisions. Tim Allen is not a critic's darling. They dismissed this show as retreading his 1990s ABC smash ""Home Improvement.""So if Tim Allen's hit show is produced by Fox, why can't Fox pick it up? Deadline reported that Fox isn't airing traditional multicamera sitcoms anymore and is leaning toward ""edgy"" comedies to try to attract younger viewers. Fox only had two weeknight sitcoms this season, both of which struggled: the beyond crass ""The Mick"" (2.9 million average viewers) and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (2.1 million average viewers). Both were renewed.Looking at all this, you can see why Tim Allen is stunned ... and why it's easy to think that a pro-Trump TV star is suddenly out of fashion largely for reasons that have nothing to do with ratings or business.

624,L,"The time has come for the media to pull out the artificial measuring stick of 100 days to evaluate President Trump. If they're kind, he'll get an ""I"" for ""incomplete."" But it's more likely they'll use other I words like ""inability,"" ""incompetence"" or ""incoherence."" Whatever they say, it won't be kind.But eight years ago? Time magazine's Joe Klein graded President Obama with an S for ""spectacular"" and ""stupendous,"" saying, ""The legislative achievements have been stupendous — the $789 billion stimulus bill, the budget plan that is still being hammered out (and may, ultimately, include the next landmark safety-net program, universal health insurance).""Notice that Klein had already granted Obama an A for things that had not passed (and with Obamacare, it would take more than another year).Associated Press reporter Liz Sidoti must have seen the dearth of policy achievements. So, instead, she gave Obama a rave review based on his personality. ""It didn't take long for Barack Obama — for all his youth and inexperience — to get acclimated to his new role as the calming leader of a country in crisis,"" she wrote. ""Rookie jitters? Far from it."" He spoke in ""firm, yet soothing tones."" He used a ""just-folks approach."" He ""displayed wonkish tendencies, too,"" and ""engaged in witty banter."" And foreign policy, he ""struck a statesmanlike stance.""Back then, nobody could tell the difference between the White House propaganda office and the press corps.Now it looks like total war.A Media Research Center analysis of the first 80 days of evening news coverage of President Trump revealed that the incessant journalistic negativity of the 2016 campaign has stayed almost exactly the same in 2017. Last October, coverage of Trump was 91% negative. Honeymoon? What honeymoon? In the first 98 days of Trump's presidency, absolutely nothing has changed. The barrage continues, to the tune of 89% negative coverage.Just like last fall, the networks have centered their stories not on ""news"" but on what they find most objectionable about Trump. The most important White House story was Trump's attempt to impose a temporary travel ban on immigrants from seven (and later six) Muslim-majority countries. The coverage was 93% negative. The second-biggest story was their obsession over whether Russia hacked the election or improperly coordinated with Trump staffers, which remains completely undocumented. That topic drew 97% negative coverage.Network news anchors have presented President Trump as a terrible liar, and for good measure, as potentially mentally ill. Three days after the inauguration, CBS anchor Scott Pelley snapped that the president engaged in ""a weekend of tweeting tantrums and falsehoods."" On Feb. 6, he knocked Trump for ""presidential statements divorced from reality,"" and on March 8, he asked Democrat Leon Panetta, ""Is it appropriate to ask whether the President is having difficulty with rationality?""NBC anchor Lester Holt asked on March 20, ""After a string of unproven claims, will this president struggle to keep the trust of the American public?"" Other journalists call this kind of badgering ""pointed truth-telling.""To be sure, President Trump doesn't always have proof for his tweets, such as accusing Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower (which received 99% negative coverage). But the coverage of Obama suggests that the media naturally assumed he was always wonderfully honest and competent, the ""cool kid in class"" who left everyone who met him ""star-struck."" Criticizing Obama was ""not very patriotic.""If the media hadn't spent the last years operating a perpetual adoration machine, then maybe all this hostility toward Trump might seem like an honest evaluation instead of a shamelessly bitter and partisan exercise.It is they, not he, who lack credibility.

By early May, shares had doubled from February 2016, hitting an all-time high of 301.40.Beauty products are a particular sweet spot in retail, and stores like Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora have flourished despite the broader shopping trends that have spelled gloom for other stores.When Ulta reports Q1 results Thursday, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Consensus is for 11% growth, according to Piper Jaffray. Double-digit same-store sales growth is something of an anomaly, as other retailers turn in declines or mild single-digit comps.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. Consensus is for 11% comp growth in Q1, says Piper Jaffray. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the ""Amazon effect.""Edward Jones still appears fairly positive on the company's outlook.""We believe the company offers one of the most compelling growth stories in the retail landscape due to its store-growth opportunity,"" wrote Yarbrough, ""and because it operates in an attractive industry and has the potential to realize further profit expansion.""Ulta's premarket tumble is similar to that of home improvement chain Lowe's (LOW). Lowe's, which was near a buy zone, fell below its 50-day line Tuesday. Lowe's fell 3% to 79.85 Wednesday on weaker-than-expected earnings and sales.RELATED:Another Wild Ride From Ulta Beauty After Earnings?

630,L,"TV comedy cannot be too harsh when directed at President Donald Trump. There are no limits, and CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert has proven it. Under the rubric of corporate loyalty after the president cut an interview short with CBS ""Face the Nation"" host John Dickerson and mocked his show as ""Deface the Nation,"" Colbert called the president a ""prick-tator,"" and then suggested the only thing the president's mouth is good for is being a holster for the sexual organ of Russian President Vladimir Putin.This was on national television, and his audience roared — and gasped.The notion of defending Dickerson and CBS as victims of Trump is a ruse. The network was given 33 minutes with the president on ""Face the Nation"" and 10 minutes on ""CBS This Morning,"" with the president fielding an endless barrage of negative questions before he finally tired of it and calmly cut off Dickerson, saying: ""That's enough. Thank you.""To put things in their proper perspective, it could be argued that Trump faced more CBS hostility in one interview than former President Barack Obama faced on CBS in eight years.Conservative Twitter swiftly imagined the reaction had Colbert aimed this ""comedic"" fire at Obama — not to mention Hillary Clinton. He would have been fired. But it was Trump, and where he's concerned, blind hatred is never having to say you're sorry.CBS refused comment to press inquiries. Colbert was pressed into a measure of regret ... by the gay left, for disparaging same-sex activity. He bowed to them by saying on his show on Wednesday, ""Anyone who expresses their love for another person, in their own way is, to me, an American hero."" (Think through the criminal stupidity of that statement.) As for Trump, he said: ""I have jokes; he has the launch codes; so it's a fair fight.""Does anyone wonder why Trump refused to attend the White House correspondents dinner? This is the level of ""humor"" he was expected to endure at the hands of industry leaders who despise him.""Liberals think comedians should lead the ""resistance"" because the journalists are just too damn nice. A video of Colbert's penis joke arrived on Twitter with a promotional sentence that read, ""Stephen tells the President everything journalists, restrained by their dignity, wish they could say.""This year, the White House Correspondents Association president and Reuters correspondent, Jeff Mason, displayed the usual schizophrenia by proclaiming it would be ""unfair"" to roast President Trump in absentia, and then hired Hasan Minhaj of ""The Daily Show"" — the son of Muslim Indian immigrants — to roast Trump. This man is best known for a vicious leftist tirade at another ""objective"" TV news dinner, including his label for Trump as a ""racist Cheeto.""Mason was surely only responding to rejected ""Daily Show"" host candidate Samantha Bee, who brought her TBS show to Washington, D.C., to tape a ""Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner"" special. In her taping before the dinner, Bee attempted to outdo Minhaj by comparing Skype questioners at the White House to survivalists who drink their own urine and delighting in the smear that Trump paid for Russian prostitutes to urinate on him.At the White House dinner, Minhaj uncorked lame jokes about ""Nazi Steve Bannon"" and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""curating her collection of children's tears. He insisted: ""Donald Trump is liar in chief. And remember, you guys"" — the press — ""are public enemy no. 1. You are his biggest enemy. Journalists, ISIS, normal-length ties. And somehow, you're the bad guys. That's why you gotta keep your foot on the gas.""The left is too angry and frustrated to admit that its poisonous remarks are having the effect of discrediting the liberal media in all its forms. It's congratulating itself while burning down the village in order to save it.

631,L,"It's something most conservatives would not have imagined a year ago: The opening act of Donald Trump's agenda in the White House contains a real whiff of President Ronald Reagan. To be sure, there's plenty the Reaganites won't like — talk of trillion-dollar federal building campaigns, taxing business at the border, etc. — but there's plenty to applaud as well.He's proposing dramatic across-the-board tax cuts. That's Reaganesque. He's reasserting American strength and resolve in response to the dictators who rattle sabers at America. That's Reaganesque. He appointed a Supreme Court justice who follows the Constitution instead of acting like a superlegislator. That's Reaganesque. He's working diligently to reduce the power of Washington, D.C. That's mega Gipper.What's missing? Craig Shirley has emerged as perhaps the most knowledgeable historian of Reagan alive today. His fourth biography is out, and it's every bit as fascinating as the first three. ""Reagan Rising"" connects the dots between the 1976 and 1980 campaigns. President Trump and/or his closest advisors need to read this book.Shirley drives home a key point: Reagan did not run against the Democrats. He did not run against the left. He ran against the establishment — at the time dominated by liberal Democrats but not limited to them. If he was to become president, he also had to defeat the Republican establishment of moderates, whose collective blood curdled at the thought of him being elected.Shirley writes that on Jimmy Carter's Inauguration Day in 1977, outgoing President Gerald Ford told a reporter as he flew out of town that he would like to run again in 1980. He added, ""I don't want anyone to pre-empt the Republican presidential nomination."" He meant Reagan.The establishment narrative was repeated constantly: Reagan was racist, sexist, homophobic, imperialist, an evil manipulator, dumb as a board and completely over his head.Reagan championed American exceptionalism. He didn't wish greatness for America. It already was great. He called for a return to it. America could become the strongest economic force in America — again. America could become the leader of the free world — again. America could become a civil society — again. In advancing these themes, he was directly challenging and threatening the GOP establishment. It was content with bloated federal power, high taxes, live-and-let-live detente and (foremost) the societal decomposition of abortion.Trump is facing the same establishment hostility because he poses the same threat (maybe an even larger one) to its power. But there's a huge difference: his response. The issue is one of temperament, which Shirley captures so well because he understands Reagan so well.Trump and Reagan had the same slogan, except for one all-important thing missing from Trump's version. In ""Let's Make America Great Again,"" Reagan was inviting America to join him as his partner in this crusade. As Shirley reminds us, in Reagan's acceptance speech at the 1980 Republican convention in Detroit, he said ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" more than 200 times. Compare that to these painful last eight years, when President Obama used ""I"" or ""my"" hundreds of times in his speeches.Candidate Trump — the Donald — has always tilted toward Obama's boastfulness. President Trump needs to stop that. Reagan's humility and confidence inspired the country. Trump must do the same if he wants to succeed. He has the refreshing confidence. He needs to find his inner public humility.No one can tell Donald Trump that he doesn't know how to win in politics. Governance, as he's learning, is another animal. Trump sees himself as transformational, and that is good. He will not be content with just dismantling the disasters created by Obama. He will push — and is already pushing — a boldness we haven't seen in GOP presidents, or even most GOP candidates, since Reagan.Maybe he should invite Craig Shirley to the Oval Office for a long chat.RELATED:Trump's 'Yuuge' Corporate Tax Cut: A Supply-Side Shot In The ArmTrump's Opening Act Is More Conservative Than ReaganDid Trump Rebuild The Reagan Majority?

632,L,"Wal-Mart (WMT) shares are rallying on an earnings beat, while four other retailers delivered better-than-expected profits. But while Wal-Mart closed at two-year highs, the other retailers had a less-positive day.Children's Place (PLCE) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter that has shares shot up initially in the stock market today, as profit grew 48% to $1.95 a share and revenue rose 4% to $436.7 million from the prior-year quarter.That easily beat consensus for $1.64 a share on sales of $422.5 million.Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which the children's clothier said was its highest Q1 comparable-sales figure ""in over a decade."" The highly watched metric is a contrast to the negative slide from department stores last week and from Target (TGT) on Wednesday.Children's Place ""continues to execute extremely well in a tough environment,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, ""with strong inventory control, expanding (average unit retail), and margin expansion.""The company upped its full-year outlook to $7.10-$7.20, up from prior guidance for $6.50-$6.65. Analysts are currently looking for $6.66 a share for 2017.Children's Place shares shot up to 124.90 soon after the open, just below Monday's record 125.30, but reversed sharply, closing down 0.45% at 111.10.Ralph Lauren (RL) beat on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings grew 1% to 89 cents a share, beating views for 78 cents; revenue fell 16% to $1.57 billion, but the slide wasn't as bad as expected. Still, Ralph Lauren, apparel retailer and clothier, reversed from early gains to finish off 1.9%.And shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) did manage to close up 2.6% after disclosing Q1 results late Wednesday that did not disappoint, even as same-store sales dropped 9%. The company nudged up full-year profit guidance to $3.10-$3.40 from $3.05-$3.35.Sporting goods retailer Hibbett (HIBB), which carries Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and other popular brands, beat on profit. Hibbett's same-store sales, however, fell 4.9% in Q1. Shares initially ran up to 24.75, but reversed to trade down 0.65% to 22.90.On the flip side, things are pretty bad for Ascena Retail Group (ASNA). The parent of women's apparel brands Ann Taylor, Loft and dressbarn, among others, is tanking in a major way, down 26.8% to 2.07 after slashing Q3 and full-year guidance. Ascena hit 17-year low of 1.65 intraday.Management now expects 10-15 cents in fiscal 2017 earnings, a fraction of its earlier guidance for 37-42 cents. For Q3, it sees 4-6 cents EPS, down from 7-12 cents in prior outlook.Ascena CEO David Jaffe said ""we ... no longer believe it appropriate to expect a stabilization of traffic and resulting normalization of comp sales against softer demand in the year-ago period."" He expects the specialty retail environment to ""remain challenging"" for the next year or two.As for Wal-Mart, shares rose 3.2% to their best levels in two years as earnings topped and e-commerce sales surged 63%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Signals It's A Real Amazon Rival As Online Sales Spike 63%Target's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchEarnings Distractions Before Next Trump Bombshell: Investing Action PlanThis Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail Meltdown

633,L,"Target (TGT) reported much-better-than-expected earnings and sales early Wednesday and gave upbeat guidance, a rare positive report from the retail sector ahead of Wal-Mart's (WMT) quarterly numbers Thursday.Estimates: Profit to drop 29.5% to 91 cents a share as revenue slips 3.6% to $15.62 billion.Results: Earnings fell 6% to $1.21 a share with revenue down about 1% to $16.017 billion. Same-store sales slid 1.3%, but that was far less than the 3.7% drop expected.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 95 cents-$1.15, with the midpoint above views for $1.00, on a same-store sales decline in the low single digits. Target did not formally revise its full-year guidance, but noted that the strong Q1 performance suggests that the retailer will top the midpoint of its prior targets.""After starting the quarter with very soft trends, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. ""We are in the early stage of a multiyear effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity.""Stock: Shares rose 3.3% to 56.33 soon after the opening bell in the stock market today. The stock is not in a great place, with a Relative Strength rating of 8 (a sign of underperformance vs. the S&P 500) and a 50-day moving average that undercut the 200-day back in February. Since December, shares have only come up for air above their 50-day line for about two weeks, total. Wal-Mart shares rose 0.9%.As retail stocks suffer one devastating blow after another (even off-price chain TJX (TJX) got munched on earnings results), Target's shares have resembled those of department stores, which had a disastrous week last week, rather than big-box counterpart Wal-Mart.Target's online strategy is notably behind that of Wal-Mart, which is broadly credited as being in better shape to fight off Amazon's (AMZN) march down the retail war path.Wal-Mart has already bought Jet.com, and so far in 2017 alone, it has announced deals to buy e-commerce properties ModCloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw.

Same-store sales rose 2%, and were up 8% at Old Navy, down 4% at Gap and down 4% at Banana Republic.Outlook: First-half EPS is now seen down by mid-single digits, better than its prior forecast for a drop in the high-single digits.

""Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin.""Stock: Ross rose 3.7% late. Shares finished 0.7% lower at 61.07, and rival TJX (TJX) ticked down 0.4% to 74.48.Retailers like the Gap have suffered as consumers opt to make purchases online and at discount retailers like Ross and TJX, whose Q1 sales and profit forecasts reported this week nonetheless weren't up to Street expectations.Macy's stock crashed last week on disappointing results, and Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO said some of its suppliers are trying to exploit the doom-hype surrounding the company to work out better deals for themselves. There are still some bright spots in retail, with Wal-Mart, L Brands (LB) and Children's Place (PLCE) rallying on strong results.For the discounters, physical space has maintained its appeal in part due to what the industry calls the in-store ""treasure hunt"" — that is, when customers walk in looking for a bargain and find a deal they didn't expect.And TJX on Tuesday said it is looking to home goods, which CEO Ernie Herrman said are less vulnerable to weather fluctuations. Home goods have been ""a driver"" for the company, he said, as they have for other retailers.Off-price chain Burlington Stores (BURL), for instance, has reduced its dependency on coats for its sales in part by sprucing up its home and beauty product lines.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighTarget's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

636,L,"Actress Meryl Streep isn't just denouncing the dire state of America at Hollywood awards shows. She's now taking her speech to far-left events, recently accepting the Ally Award from the LGBTQ political-correctness police at the Human Rights Campaign. Since so many Americans will never get to stand on an awards show stage and speak their mind about what's wrong with the world, we thought we'd present a speech responding to Streep and what she represents.""It is such an opportunity to present our thoughts on behalf of the broad swath of America that didn't earn the right to offer grand orations about politics and world history on national television because we took acting classes at Vassar and Yale. It is refreshing to speak up for people who don't complain about growing up inside what Meryl Streep calls 'the straitjacket of conformist suburban life.'""Many Americans who chose not to vote for Hillary Clinton are now accused of being nostalgic for an America that never existed, or for an America that was a living hell of discrimination. But these accused Americans aren't exactly thinking of Civil War days. They are recalling heir own childhoods, during which the 'straitjacket' was the nuclear family, a civil society, a respect for God, uncontroversial bathrooms and televised awards shows without the blather of coddled megalomaniacs.""Professional entertainers like Meryl Streep lament the existence of fundamentalists among us who oppose everything the forces of tolerance are constantly pressuring us to accept, lest we risk the wrath of the tolerance community. For the Coexist crowd, there is somehow nothing fundamentalist in saying there is no room for prayer in public life, no room for dissent on LGBTQ rights, no science in declaring that an unborn child is a human and no science in identifying gender by genitals. The Hollywood left that never let anyone forget a blacklist of communists is today identifying dissent from the leftist agenda as a firing (or never-hiring) offense. These alleged nonfundamentalists even denounce people who try to stay apolitical as ignorant or cowardly.""Fundamentalists like Streep are celebrated by their peers as the nuanced voices, but they can only describe the agenda of their opponents in the starkest terms of an evil and emotional backlash — forces of fear and ignorance, harassment and oppression. As artists, they claim to have the wildest and broadest imaginations, but somehow, they can't imagine that someone could arrive at an opposing viewpoint through study and reason and, dare we say, prayer from time to time.""Worst of all, leftists like Meryl Streep think they are the ones who can quote Thomas Jefferson at us about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance. Since when has the left ever represented liberty? When has it promoted limited government under the Constitution? It thinks the Constitution is only there for its mysterious penumbras that somehow empower abortion clinics, enforce censorship that's called 'inclusion' and fight 'slut shaming' and 'rape culture.'""Finally, the silliest thing Streep decried was that 'Disrespect invites disrespect, and violence invites violence.' Before she uncorks that lecture, she should reread every disrespectful thing she has launched at conservatives. As for violence, it's hard to proclaim that you oppose bullying while accepting an unborn child getting her brains removed. God bless you all. And at the risk of being really, really offensive, God bless Meryl Streep!""RELATED:Trump News & TweetsMedia Malpractice?

637,L,"Dr. Ben Carson, in a speech before employees of Housing and Urban Development, the department he now runs, likened slaves to ""immigrants"": ""That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder, for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.""Carson got hammered.Late-night comic Trevor Noah said: ""It makes them sound like they work at Wal-Mart. ... Calling slaves 'immigrants' is like saying: 'It's not kidnapping. That person just got a free vacation in a basement.' ... Slaves weren't immigrants. Because an immigrant has choice. They choose the country they're going to because they hope it will bring them a better life. Saying that slaves are just another group of immigrants erases how black people were uniquely oppressed in America. It helps justify blaming African-Americans for their hardships.""Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted: ""OK!! Ben Carson ... I can't! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF---- PLEASE!!! #d---headedtom.""Actress Whoopi Goldberg said: ""Were the slaves really thinking about the American dream? No, because they were thinking, 'What the hell just happened?!' You know, when people immigrate, they come with the idea that they're going someplace for a better life. ... It's voluntary. ... How does he miss what slavery is?! How does he miss that no slave came to this country willingly? ... Ben, 'Roots.' Watch 'Roots.'""TV personality Star Jones tweeted: ""No way in the world he is that friggin ignorant."" Using the pile-of-excrement emoji, she called the renowned neurosurgeon ""(expletive) for brains."" She ended the tweet: ""#UncleTom thy name is #BenCarson.""Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., insists that Carson's ""slave equals immigrant"" perspective means he is unqualified to lead HUD because Carson ""doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism"" in housing: ""It's disturbing to me, and it should be to every American, not just black Americans. ... For him, the HUD secretary, to have a stunning misunderstanding of history like that, is really, really striking. ... And so for the HUD secretary not to get that means that he doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism and discrimination in housing, which is a very scary thing for the HUD secretary to not understand.""
"
638,L,"Following the uproar, Carson posted this clarification on Facebook: ""The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences. ... The two experiences should never be intertwined, nor forgotten, as we demand the necessary progress towards an America that's inclusive and provides access to equal opportunity for all.""One slight problem.The ""insensitive"" and ""demeaning"" slave-equals-immigrant argument was made on a number of occasions by President Barack Obama: ""It wasn't always easy for new immigrants,"" Obama said at a 2015 naturalization ceremony for new citizens. ""Certainly it wasn't easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves. There was discrimination and hardship and poverty. But, like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them. And they were able to muster faith that, here in America, they might build a better life and give their children something more.""Even ""Daily Show"" host Noah admitted, ""President Obama said something similar in 2015."" But, said Noah, ""You could tell before (Obama) said that part he was thinking, 'Damn, my speechwriter f---ed up.'""In fact, according to the Federalist, Obama likened slaves to immigrants on 11 different occasions. ""Whether our ancestors landed on Ellis Island,"" said Obama, ""or came here on a slave ship or crossed the Rio Grande, we are all connected to one another. We rise and fall together.""Goldberg, Noah, Jackson and Ellison were obviously occupied the 11 times Obama showed he ""doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism.""Why the silence over Obama's many slave-equals-immigrant comments versus the desk pounding by the same critics when Carson says the same thing? Carson represents an existential threat to the left. He is deadly to their cause — a black man, raised in poverty by a hardworking, welfare-abstaining single mom who taught her children to embrace hard work and education. The left believes that blacks are perpetual victims of slavery, Jim Crow and racism. It is vital for the existence of the Democratic Party to convince blacks to vote like victims in need of protection from the racist, sexist retrogrades known as Republicans. So black conservatives like Carson, who argues that welfare creates dependency, who demands choice in K-12 education and who believes hard work wins, must be attacked, marginalized and dismissed as ""against their own people.""

639,L,"It's good to see a stock pull back after a long, healthy run. After all, that gives it a chance to catch its breath and set the stage for what could be the next leg up.When you see a stock make its third pullback, dig a little deeper; the setup could be more than just an ordinary pullback. The stock may be shaping an ascending base.Unlike cups, cup with handles, double bottoms and flat bases, all of which are quite common, ascending bases are rare. They are also tougher to spot, but they can be powerful patterns.In 1999, Internet service provider America Online cleared an ascending base and nearly doubled in about five weeks. Specialty metal producer Titanium Metals bolted out from a 15-week ascending base in 2006. The stock doubled in about seven weeks.An ascending base usually forms after a stock has already broken out from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom pattern. So there should be a prior uptrend of at least 20%.One can characterize the ascending base as a pattern of a strong stock in a not-so-strong market. Each time the stock tries to rally, the weight of the overall market holds it back. Once the resistance from the general market disappears, the stock is free to make its advance — kind of like removing a brick off a heavy metal spring.The key distinguishing feature in an ascending base formation is its three pullbacks. Each one has a higher high and higher low, which gives it the overall ascending appearance.Each retreat should be due to general market weakness. And each pullback should be limited to no more than 10% to 20%.Sometimes these pullbacks will take the stock to its 10-week or 50-day moving average.Ascending bases take more time to form than other patterns. They usually develop over nine to 16 weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the third pullback. Volume should be at least 40% above normal on breakout day.Retailer Limited Brands, now called L Brands (LB), cleared a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Feb. 26, 1982 (1). The stock gained 43% by late July before retreating to its 10-week moving average (2). It came out of that pullback and shot up for 10 straight weeks. After that rampage, the stock fell 13% (3) — the first of what would be three pullbacks of an ascending base.A second retreat came in January 1983. The stock fell 17% before finding support near its 10-week line (4). Limited's third pullback came in March. That set up an ascending base with a 15.29 buy point (5), which is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split later in the year.The stock cleared that base in the week ended March 25, 1983.

640,L,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew close to the Russia border last month as a show of force, but Pentagon officials said Monday they aren't concerned about adversaries obtaining any intelligence about it during the stealth fighter's public display.Several of the Air Force's F-35A variants were deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia, which borders Russia, and Bulgaria, which is across the Black Sea from Russian forces in Crimea, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, a program for placing U.S. forces in the region that began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea.When asked about security issues related to flying the F-35 so close to Russia, Pleus said that while pilots are always nervous about adversaries gleaning information from the plane, the Pentagon has ""procedures available"" to prevent that from happening.""We have in place through a partner of networks proper procedures for us to make sure we can fly the airplane when we want to, in places that we want to, and that people cannot collect information off of the F-35,"" Brig. Gen. Scott L. Pleus, director at the F-35 Integration Office, told a group of reporters Monday.He wouldn't go into the types of procedures, saying they were classified. The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base are scheduled to give more details Wednesday about its first deployment to Europe.Lockheed shares closed 0.4% higher at 272.36 on the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, edged up 0.1%. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor, added 0.3%.Meanwhile, a critical F-35 system performed without a hitch in Europe.The Autonomic Logistics Information System — which Lockheed calls ""the IT backbone of the F-35"" that integrates preventive maintenance, flight scheduling and the mission planning system — had some serious issues during development and the system was flagged as a major flaw in a Government Accountability Office report last year.But Pleus said he had ""heard of no problems at all with ALIS.""The ALIS version 2.0.2 update, which integrates key engine information into the system, was recently approved for deployment to the F-35 fleet.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

642,L,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) delivered another Street-topping quarter late Thursday, one that marked a second consecutive period of accelerating profit and sales growth. The specialty beauty retailer's same-store sales growth of 16.6% is practically unheard of in this lukewarm retail environment.Yet Ulta Beauty tumbled in after-hours trading Thursday and fell at Friday's open to test its 50-day moving average before soon reversing higher. Shares finished 4.6% higher at 286.42 trade after setting an all-time high of 285.92 in the stock market today. Ulta is back in buy range from a 274.09 buy point, but this is the first time it's crossing that entry area in heavy volume.So what gives? Was that overnight selling a sign that investors are getting nervous about this retail outperformer's stamina?Guidance was soft, for one. For 2017, Ulta said it expects ""low twenties percentage range"" profit growth, below current analyst expectations for 26% gains in per-share earnings. First-quarter outlook of $1.75-$1.80 EPS on $1.244 billion-$1.265 billion also came in light vs. views for $1.80 a share and $1.273 billion in revenue.But longtime followers of Ulta know that management has historically provided conservative guidance.""ULTA has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since 1Q10 as one of the best guiders we cover,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel. ""We expect this to prove conservative yet again.""Another cause for concern late Thursday? A miss on gross margin estimates. Ulta's gross profit fell by 10 basis points from the prior year quarter, short of forecasts for a 40 basis point gain, ""as management called out tough compares against reduced promos (last year) and ongoing fixed cost investments,"" according to Wells Fargo's Ike Boruchow.He added that while Ulta's quarter was ""clearly a standout in retail today,"" the gross margin miss was ""a little surprising,"" since it was the first quarter in two years that the company's gross margin did not expand. Boruchow maintained a market perform rating on the stock and raised full-year earnings estimates.But analysts don't seem particularly worried by the gross margin miss. Piper Jaffray's Stephanie Wissink, who rates Ulta overweight, said this was ""less of a concern given the favorable dollar contribution of lower margin rate prestige brands.""Additionally, Wissink pointed to Ulta's 63.4% e-commerce growth, which points to improved logistics and fulfillment, in her view, boosted by distribution-center investments, inventory management and quick order-turnaround times.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com is a formidable foe for retailers, but it lacks a satisfying in-store experience and other ""It"" factors that cosmetics shoppers want. Lackluster foot traffic and e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) have weighed heavily on department stores like Macy's (M) and specialty apparel retailers.But Ulta's online sales now account for 9.8% of total sales, as of Q4, even as retail same-store sales rose 12.8%, bucking a retail earnings season littered with strong online numbers but weak or declining in-store comps.Management expects total comparable sales to rise 9%-11% in the current quarter and 8%-10% for the year.That has many looking sunnily on the stock.""Although we fully understand setups & sentiment, a (high single-digit to low double-digit) traffic-driven comp guide from a perpetually conservative management seems like a win in this environment of brick & mortar pain,"" wrote Instinet's Siegel, who has a buy rating on Ulta.Separately, value cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) closed down 2.5%, ending above its 50-day line after undercutting that support level earlier. On Thursday, e.l.f. shot up 12.3% on strong earnings and guidance, though the stock closed well off its session high.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Earnings, Sales Strong, But Guidance Isn't Pretty

Sales climbed 17% to $76.4 million, also beating views for $74.5 million.Looking ahead, e.l.f. sees 2017 EPS of 40-43 cents and sales of $285 million-$291 million, both above analyst forecasts for EPS of 37 cents on sales of $281 million.The company's makeup lines are sold in Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and at some of its stand-alone stores.RELATED: Ulta Beauty Forms New Holding Company For 'More Efficient' Structure

646,L,"Fox News took Bill O'Reilly off the air after a heavy campaign to fire him led by CNN's media unit and The New York Times. If all the charges of sexual harassment are true, his case is indefensible. That said, it's time for his media critics to stand down. They are guilty of rank hypocrisy.These same media outlets despised the idea that Donald Trump would drag Bill Clinton's sexual harassment lawsuits into the presidential campaign. On Jan. 8, 2016, the Times editorial staff sneered: ""It is also a tired subject that few Americans want to hear more about. If Mr. Trump has not read enough, he can curl up with a copy of the Starr report.""Bizarrely, the editorial noted that Hillary Clinton had told a New Hampshire town hall questioner a month earlier that Juanita Broaddrick's tale of rape was not to be believed. Yet it was Trump who was denounced as sexist and beyond the pale. The Times said: ""His aim is to dredge up an ancient scandal and tar Mrs. Clinton with it in a clearly sexist fashion. There should be no place for that kind of politics in this country."" That is, unless it's the top draw at Fox News, in which case it's suddenly America's greatest concern.On April 2, 2017, the Times published a 3,148-word front-page article lamenting ""O'Reilly Thrives as Settlements Add Up."" Reporters Emily Steel and Michael Schmidt declared that their investigation found five women who received payouts from either O'Reilly or Fox ""in exchange for agreeing to not pursue litigation or speak about their accusations against him. The agreements totaled about $13 million.""As they noted, the lion's share of that total came in a $9 million settlement from 2004. That was 13 years ago, but it didn't qualify as a ""tired subject"" or some ""ancient scandal.""CNN relentlessly pushed for O'Reilly's dismissal, calling up advertisers and pressuring them to take commercials off their competition. Bashing O'Reilly dominated their Sunday show ""Reliable Sources"" for weeks and their ""news"" programming after their victory.But two days after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke in 1998, CNN aired a town hall meeting titled ""Investigating the President: Media Madness?"" Host Jeff Greenfield insisted that millions of Americans were ""asking the press one question fraught with significance: What the hell are you people doing trying to find out what kind of sex the President of the United States might or might not be having?""Back then, it was ""media madness"" to investigate whether then-President Bill Clinton might be assaulting women in the workplace — the Oval Office. There was zero concern about a ""culture of abuse"" inside the White House. For good measure, CNN moved on to specials attacking special prosecutor Ken Starr for prudishly investigating where CNN and the rest of the press never wanted to go.It's not only CNN and the Times that are displaying a different moral standard. Does no one find it just a wee bit ironic that disgraced Brian Williams is still doing a weeknight show on MSNBC, where he can lecture that O'Reilly was dispatched by ""the power of the female consumer""?Women deserve a workplace where men don't harass them for sex. But that's not what these sanctimonious liberal journalists care about. It just doesn't matter how brutal the alleged rape of Juanita Broaddrick was. What matters is that Bill O'Reilly had to go.Bill Clinton is laughing.Note: This column was  updated to add the word ""not"" to the second sentence in the second to last paragraph.

648,L,"Leftist protesters around the country used the tax deadline on April 18 as an occasion to hold rallies demanding the release of President Trump's tax returns. They could use large inflatable chickens and signs with hammers and sickles saying ""Show us your rubles"" and no journalist would be offended.Knowing the president, this will have all the effectiveness of national rallies that demand we get transcripts of Hillary Clinton's six-figure speeches. It's unlikely.But the Saturday network newscasts promoted the anti-Trump ""resistance"" without really noting that it's a bit strange for left-wingers to be protesting on taxes, unless they think rates are dangerously low. CBS correspondent Errol Barnett announced, ""As nationwide Tax Day protests reached the sunny streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, today, President Trump spent time at his International Golf Club and Mar-a-Lago resort nearby.""On ABC, they acknowledged ""violent clashes"" among protesters in California, and anchor Tom Llamas promoted the wave, saying, ""There were about 150 Tax Day protests demanding to see the president's tax returns, even at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort."" NBC led the whole newscast on the protests, including the violence that erupted in Berkeley.Something was missing in all of this protest publicity: the notion that the protesters weren't a real grass-roots movement. Liberal journalists are always happy to see liberal protesters boosting any mob that matches their ideals. Because they are liberal, they are always presented as authentic, diverse and representative of the public, regardless of the last election's results. It can be rigidly organized by MoveOn and other leftist groups, but it will be painted as spontaneous.But rewind to eight years ago: While the networks covered conservative Tax Day protests against then-President Obama, the emphasis was on how phony they were.ABC reporter Dan Harris suggested the protesters were AstroTurf ""cheered on by Fox News and talk radio."" As opposed to ""authentic"" organizers cheered by ABC, CBS and NBC? Harris added: ""Critics on the left say this is not a real grassroots phenomenon at all, that it's actually largely orchestrated by people fronting for corporate interests. ... While the Boston Tea Party in 1773 was about taxation without representation, critics point out that today's protesters did get to vote — they just lost.""CBS reporter Dean Reynolds announced that while ""a fistful of rightward-leaning websites and commentators embraced the cause. ... fresh polling indicates there is not all that much passion about high taxes in the country at large right now. Gallup this week found 61% of Americans see their federal income taxes as fair.""On NBC, Lee Cowan reported that ""organizers insist today's tea parties were organic uprisings of like-minded taxpayers from both parties,"" but ""some observers suggest not all of it was as homegrown as it may seem."" His ""observer"" was colleague Chuck Todd, who didn't exactly have his finger on the 2010 pulse. Earlier that day, Todd insisted that the idea of these ""so-called tea parties ... hasn't really caught on.""Oops. Wishful thinking trumped reporting.The networks also spent the Obama years ignoring how the tea party was motivated by historically enormous trillion-dollar deficits. Facts like those were stubborn things. Journalists felt it was best to navigate around them as the ""news"" consisted of congratulating Obama for his ability to sing Al Green songs and his rib-tickling ObamaCare-promoting interviews with supportive comedians.It's ironic that the liberal media now accuse President Trump of lacking any principles and being indifferent to public policy matters. Perhaps after their performance in the last eight years, the anchormen should be looking in the mirror.RELATED:Now We Know, Trump Paid More Than His Fair Share Of Taxes In 2005Why Does It Cost $409 Billion To Figure Out What We Owe In Taxes?Trump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get One

Sales surged 87% to $55.6 million. Analysts were expecting Universal Display to break even on sales of $33.8 million.""We believe that the OLED industry is poised to grow faster than earlier expectations this year,"" Universal Display Chief Financial Officer Sidney Rosenblatt said in a statement. ""We are therefore raising our 2017 revenue guidance range to at least $260 million to $280 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%.""It previously guided to 2017 revenue of $230 million to $250 million.Universal Display is seeing customers ramp up investments in new manufacturing capacity to support an array of new display and lighting products, he said.Smartphone makers such as Samsung are increasingly using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays instead of traditional LCD displays because they are thinner, more power-efficient and offer richer colors and a faster refresh rate. Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be using an OLED smartphone display for the first time in its upcoming iPhone 8 handset.

652,L,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) will put four programs to treat Parkinson's, migraines and multiple sclerosis on the back burner to deal with the potential loss of funding wrought by the planned expiration of exclusive sales rights for its multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra in July 2018, CEO Ron Cohen said.Though Acorda is appealing the invalidation of four patents protecting Ampyra, the midcap biotech is planning to trim $50 million per year from its expenses. Cohen says the company invests 40% of its revenue into research and development.In the meantime, Acorda will focus on two Parkinson's drugs — the furthest along in its pipeline of six. Inbrija, also known as CVT-301, is an inhaled version of L-DOPA, a key treatment for Parkinson's. Tozadenant can be added to treatment regimens to extend the amount of time users have muscle control.Still, Cohen told Investor's Business Daily, those two drugs will do ""very little"" to curb the loss of Ampyra exclusivity. In 2016, Ampyra brought in $493 million in sales. Acorda is planning to file an application with the FDA for Inbrija by the end of June and expects a 10-month review.""Ampyra is an over $500 million net revenue stream now and even Inbrija is approved in 2018 and we launch it, it's not going to be anywhere close to $500 million in the first year,"" he said. ""It takes time in a launch to ramp up as more and more patients are aware of it and doctors prescribe it.""Data on Inbrija have been strong, Cohen said. Inhaling L-DOPA, as opposed to taking a pill, is a much faster method of delivery, he said. In clinical trials, Inbrija began working as early as 10 minutes relative to the placebo. It hasn't been shown to cause any damage to the lungs.Swallowing pills tends to be a slower method of delivery because it requires digestion. Inhaled drugs have fewer barriers to pass to begin working, he said. In another study, patients on L-DOPA were found to still have unabsorbed pills in their stomachs two hours after taking them.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda isn't the only company suffering troubles with multiple sclerosis drugs. Biogen's (BIIB) MS franchise is facing competition from Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Biogen's takeover prospects are now close to nil.But it's a balancing act because too many drugs can cause uncontrolled movements called dyskinesia.""They either have too little or they have too much,"" he said. ""And because trying to take more pills can screw up their whole regimen, that's also not a good solution.""Acorda is also working on tozadenant, which Cohen called the first new mechanism for Parkinson's in more than 20 years. Patients on multiple Parkinson's regimens can add tozadenant to increase the amount of time they have muscle control. In trials, the drug extended ""on periods"" by an hour.But, to focus on Inbreja and tozadenant, drugs in Parkinson's, migraine and multiple sclerosis will have to take a back seat, be partnered on or licensed out, Cohen said. A fourth drug, a recently acquired anti-inflammatory, was always planned to be licensed as it's not in Acorda's neurological sweet spot.Eventually, Cohen says, he'd like to restart those programs. The migraine and heart failure drugs, though, were already slated for the back burner because of, respectively, side effects in the liver and lungs.""In essence, this is a partial, tactical retreat so we can come back with success and ramp up our investments in the earlier-stage products,"" he said. ""It may be along the way we find it necessary to partner those programs with some other companies.""RELATED:Acorda Trims 20% Of Workforce But Looming Cuts Could Be DeeperAcorda, Forward, Biogen Fall On Multiple Sclerosis Drug FightAcorda, Forward Stocks Plunge On Multiple Sclerosis Court Rulings

653,L,"Hillary Clinton has granted her first public interview since losing the election. It came on April 6 at the Women in the World Summit, organized by leftist editor Tina Brown. Clinton was introduced by comedian Samantha Bee. On cue, as expected, she gushed: ""You deserve to hear it 100 times — it should have been you.""The assignment to interview Clinton fell to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. He later wrote a column on his Hillary chat, beginning by saying: ""In the most wrenching, humiliating way possible, Hillary Clinton has been liberated. She is now out of the woods again, and speaking her mind.""And why not? The path is marked by rose petals dutifully placed by her equally humiliated legions in the press.It was ""humiliating"" to lose to Donald Trump — that lout. Clinton was the anointed one, and as the press told us, she was the most qualified presidential applicant since Thomas Jefferson. So the feminists at this conference wanted to know: Why do Americans hate women so deeply? What the hell is wrong with those self-hating white Republican women?This was the kind of challenging ""question"" Kristof lobbed at Clinton: ""This is a women's empowerment conference, so I have to ask. You know, fundamentally, a man who bragged about sexual assault won the election and won 53% of the white women's vote. How is it that in the 21st century — and what does it say about the challenges that one faces in women's empowerment — that in effect, misogyny won with a lot of women voters?""Clinton loved the question. It's the kind of softball she's been served her entire career. ""Certainly, misogyny played a role,"" she declared. ""I mean, that just has to be admitted."" She and Kristof mulled over what he called ""abundant social science research"" that says we admire men for being ambitious and successful but find women ""less likable"" when they are powerful.So here we are, five months after the election, and the best analysis these people can muster sounds exactly like ... the last weekend of the campaign. Then-President Barack Obama used this argument as his closer: Don't be a sexist! He said: ""I want you to think about it because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy.""Clinton complained that when she left the State Department, her approval rating was 64% or 65%, but ""by the time they finished with me, I was Typhoid Mary."" ""They"" meant Trump and the conservative media. Never would this woman ever concede that the more the public saw and heard her, the less it liked her. In an added note of self-pity, she added: ""Poor Mary. She didn't deserve it either.""The woman who might have been our commander in chief standing up to Russia, Iran, North Korea and the Islamic State group complained about being called names, drawing fervent applause. She explained that the aim of anti-Clinton bullying was ""to crush your spirit, to make you feel inadequate, to make you doubt yourself. And I just refused to do that, and that infuriated them even more.""Nowhere in this dialogue, and nowhere in the Kristof column that followed, did they even briefly entertain the notion that misogyny could define the Clintons. She can complain about Trump's ""targeting of women"" but can't imagine that anyone could say the same for her husband. Let us not forget that Kristof and his newspaper thought Juanita Broaddrick's absolutely believable accusation of Bill Clinton raping her was ""toxic waste.""Hillary Clinton never allows an interviewer who would ask her about her role leading the Bimbo-Bashing Patrol to destroy the reputations of her husband's victims. No one is allowed to ask whether Broaddrick was lying when she said that after the alleged assault, Hillary Clinton gripped her hand firmly and thanked her for her support, and suggested that she stay quiet.They certainly refuse to contemplate that women could vote for Trump because Clinton stood passionately on the libertine left, supporting abortion on demand, every LGBT dictate and the erosion of religious liberty. It is reported that half of the aborted babies are girls. Couldn't that be ""misogyny""?If only someone at these media-elite confabs would ask how a majority of women can be smeared as hating themselves if they don't check every radical-feminist box.

654,L,"The late-night comics turned their liberal rage on Ivanka Trump after she granted an interview on April 5 to ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King.It was an interesting choice for a television interview considering King would clearly be hostile. She partied with Oprah and the Obamas in the White House after President Obama's first inauguration. Need one question her political leanings?It should have come as no surprise when King asked whether Ivanka was ""complicit"" in her father's administration, as if President Trump's presidency should be considered illegal and morally bankrupt.King was borrowing from a nasty ""Saturday Night Live"" skit that went viral on the left, of a fake Ivanka Trump perfume ad with the tagline ""Complicit: the fragrance for the woman who could stop all of this but won't.""The president's daughter responded like a politician, saying, ""If being complicit means wanting to be a force for good and wanting to make a positive impact, then I'm complicit.""Hours later, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert pulled out a dictionary and read the illegal/wrongdoing definition of ""complicit"" and mocked Trump, saying her response was like saying, ""If being a Nazi means fighting for civil rights, then yeah, I'm a huge Nazi!""Mocking the quote where Trump's lawyer said she would be her father's ""eyes and ears"" in the White House, feminist TBS host Samantha Bee cracked that the first daughter will be ""spending a lot of time staring at her own boobies.""King channeled all the liberal outrage that Trump should be like a younger version of Hillary Clinton inside the White House, stopping everything that liberals don't like. She cited anonymous ""critics"" — i.e., the people she'd just spoken with down the hall at the water cooler — bemoaning her failure to foil the conservatives.She said: ""You also talk about the critics, and you have a couple who say, 'Why isn't Ivanka speaking out? Where is she on Planned Parenthood? Where is she on gay rights? Where is she on the rights of women? Where is she on climate change?' And it's like you're being held personally accountable for not speaking up. What do you say to your critics?""Trump naturally answered that just because she's not denouncing her father in public doesn't mean she can't wield her liberal influence inside the family. But obviously, the government is not moving in the direction of ""New York values"" right now, so that clearly wasn't good enough.Now compare: The day before CBS launched into Trump, it offered a typically fawning interview to Chelsea Clinton. No one has ever asked Chelsea Dearest whether she was ""complicit"" in her father's sexual offenses, or ""complicit"" in her family's corrupt foundation, even though she's a vice chair. Put the emphasis on ""vice.""Instead, America witnessed all the mandatory mewling over her wonderfulness. Will she run for president? King couldn't curb her enthusiasm. She said: ""Is there anybody else in the Clinton household thinking about running? And by anybody, I mean you. You could take your book on the road while you're campaigning with 'Get Informed, Get Inspired, Get Going.' I feel like déjà vu with your mom all over again. Are you running? Are you running? Are you running?""Earth to CBS: The country just said no to a Clinton dynasty.Co-host Norah O'Donnell asked: ""What do you think about what Russia did during the campaign? ... Do you think they had any role in your mother's defeat — Russian influence?"" They simply will not accept that their candidate lost to him because America didn't want her.The double standard on first daughters and their parents never ends. One gets powder puffs and cotton candy. The other gets a sledgehammer.One hopes there will be a learning moment here for Ivanka Trump. Sometimes the best response to a media request is to just say no.RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

656,L,"On April 5, The New York Times published an op-ed by retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal headlined ""Save PBS. It Makes Us Safer."" McChrystal now runs a big lobbying firm, so that may be why he cares so much — he's a gun for hire.So how does the general think PBS makes us safer? And from what are we safer? The answer: commercialism. Parents like his son and daughter-in-law ""are busy in the morning and busy at night,"" he says. ""They want to protect their children from over-commercialized content.""This argument is bizarre — actually, let's call it what it is: disingenuous — at a time when ""Sesame Street,"" which was used to illustrate this article online, of course, is now an HBO property.""Sesame Street"" is the embodiment of the need for public funding? This is nonsense. Big Bird generates a fortune in the private sector. When you search ""Sesame Street"" under ""all departments"" on the Amazon website, it produces 39,276 results.McChrystal concluded that the people defunding PBS are waging a war on civil society, asking, ""Why then would we degrade or destroy an institution that binds us together?""Some lobbyists will say anything. We hope he's well-compensated for writing those words. He's also featured in a video made by the lobbying group America's Public Television Stations claiming that public media ""gets to the center"" and is the ""adult in the room"" of the news business.So what is it that binds us together anyway? Justin Haskins reports at TheBlaze that the PBS LearningMedia website has a lesson plan for grades nine through 12 titled ""Dying to be a Martyr."" The lesson ""investigates conflict in the Middle East using interviews with young would-be suicide bombers."" Video interviews shown in the class were done in 2004.First, there's 18-year-old Mohanned Abu Tayyoun, a Palestinian ""who entered Israel carrying a bag of explosives with the intention of carrying out a suicide bombing."" But he wavered and ""returned home without carrying out the mission.""Tayyoun is interviewed from a jail cell in Israel about why he wanted to be a suicide bomber. He said: ""Martyrdom leads us to God. I don't want this life. When you become a martyr, your prize for carrying out the operation is going to heaven. ... We Palestinians prefer to die, just kill ourselves, rather than live this worthless life. Our life's worthless. We are hollow bodies living a pointless life. Israelis enjoy their life. They go out at night. They have cafes and nightclubs. They travel all over the world. They go to America and Britain. We can't even leave Palestine.""Teachers are told: ""Check for understanding by asking students to respond to the focus question. (Mohanned feels he would rather die and by a martyr than live his life, sees his life as hollow — in contrast he sees Israelis as happy, going out, having fun, traveling.) Ask your students why Mohanned may feel that way.""In other words, feel his pain. We'd rather ask why PBS feels it can abuse the American taxpayer this way.There's more. Students watch 25-year-old Majdi Amer, who built a bomb and prepared a suicide bomber for a bus attack in Haifa, Israel, ""that killed 17 people and wounded 50"" in March 2003.Amer is asked why he believes it's acceptable to kill women and children. He says: ""If the Israelis kill a child in Gaza, I'm ready to kill one in Tel Aviv. If they destroy houses in Gaza, I'll do it in Tel Aviv. If they give me security in my land, then there's no problem.""Teachers are then tasked to explore ""how Majdi and Mohanned's opinions differ from one another, even though they are both Palestinians involved in suicide bombing plots."" The lesson planners at PBS have no instructions to denounce suicide bombing or radical Islam. None.The website lists JPMorgan Chase and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as the funders. That means you are paying for this.Dear General McChrystal: PBS isn't ""making us safer"" by promoting suicide bombers like the ones that killed your soldiers in Afghanistan.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?

Amazon.com (AMZN) looms ever larger as the reason for many retail woes.But the off-price, home improvement and specialty beauty sectors frequently get call-outs for eluding Amazon's tentacles.And one indicator of Ulta's holiday-quarter performance may come from rival Sephora, whose parent company LVMH reported results in late January.""We're optimistic on the opportunity for sustained growth at ULTA, as LVMH reported further (double-digit) growth in revenue and profit at Sephora, driven by market share gains in all regions,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in late January, adding that strong shopper demand for specialty beauty products ""bodes well for Ulta.""In fact, he appears to prefer it over Sephora, which only carries high-end ""prestige"" brands.

667,L,"Eli Lake at Bloomberg News reported on April 3 that President Trump's lawyers discovered it was former President Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice who allegedly ""requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign.""Susan Rice at the center of another scandal? Yes, and she's lying about it on TV again. On ""PBS NewsHour"" on March 22, anchor Judy Woodruff introduced the interview by telling viewers she asked Rice about whether Trump and his transition officials ""may have been swept up in surveillance of foreigners at the end of the Obama administration.""Rice protested: ""I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today."" The Obama appointees were supposed to be smart, and yet they always say they didn't know anything.The PBS interview came about because the Washington Post allowed Rice to make a transparently hypocritical argument about truth twisting on its op-ed page that day. A preposterous promotional email headline read: ""Susan Rice: When the White House twists the truth, we are all less safe. The actions of America's allies — and enemies — depend on our perceived credibility.""On Sept. 16, 2012 — five days after radical Islamic terrorists killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya — Susan Rice lied through her teeth on five Sunday news programs that this preplanned attack with rocket launchers was somehow a ""spontaneous reaction"" to a ""hateful and offensive video"" on YouTube. Then, like many liars, she had the audacity in 2014 to declare on ""Meet the Press,"" ""What I said to you that morning, and what I did every day since, was to share the best information that we had at the time.""Everyone knows that is patently false. Evidence flowed in that she and the president and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew it was a terrorist attack. But everyone claimed otherwise for more than a week. They had an election to win. The media gently helped them lie.Journalists now declare in self-righteous tones that they care dearly about the facts and will never spread delusions. But Judy Woodruff threw a softball, asking Rice to explain the ""serious charge"" against Trump in her Post article. She never made the obvious point that Rice was the least qualified bureaucrat to lecture anyone about telling the truth on national security issues.Eli Lake's story on Rice wasn't evaluated for truth or falsehood. It was dismissed as a pro-Trump story designed to change the subject (or the target). ABC and NBC skipped any mention of it on their evening newscasts. CBS mentioned it in passing.CNN anchor Don Lemon spoke for many journalists as he hissed: ""There is no evidence that backs up the president's original claim. And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.""""Aid and abet."" The ""objective"" anchors at CNN treat the president as a criminal in their metaphors. The media don't care first about facts. They care first about liberal victory. Their hope now is to remove Trump from office. Keep that in mind when they speak.

""Growing demand from new consumers broadening our market has continued, with younger families increasingly buying more affordably priced travel trailers and smaller motorhomes,"" said CEO Bob Martin in a statement. ""These positive trends give us confidence that Thor and the industry will outpace volumes achieved in 2016, which was the best year of wholesale RV shipments since the 1970s.  We remain convinced that these trends will continue to drive industry growth in future periods, as we provide new consumers with positive experiences that prompt them to become lifelong RVers.""  Martin added that expansion projects at its Keystone, Jayco and Heartland units should begin to ramp up over the remainder of fiscal 2017 and into fiscal 2018. Stock: Thor fell 3% late.

672,L,"The Trump administration is less than a month old, and former Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, the brand-new national security advisor, has resigned. This matches the picture the anti-Trump media want to paint right now: Chaos. Disarray. Amateur hour.They also expect the president to help them paint it. This is why they're going nuclear. But he chose to ignore them instead.Journalists came out of a joint news conference between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau livid that the president had called on two ""friendly"" journalists instead of someone who would hammer him about Flynn. They bashed the two American questioners for asking the leaders about relations between the U.S. and Canada. But are the media elites really always hostile to ""friendly"" questioners?Former President Obama (and Democratic presidents before him) could always call on friendly journalists at these usually staid joint news conferences. Journalists didn't yell at one another for not being harsh enough. They had no interest in scalps in the first month.Over the last eight years, the press was never interested in making trouble for Obama. Instead, it projected the opposite. He was ""scandal-free."" If he had trouble, it didn't come from a rough news conference. It emerged from evil Republicans who were plotting.Exhibit A is ABC's Terry Moran. Eight years ago at this time, Moran interviewed the new liberal president for ""Nightline."" He looked at Obama in sorrow and said, ""Mr. President, you got no honeymoon, not a single Republican vote in the House on your first major piece of legislation."" He then speculated: ""I wonder, in coming into the presidency, maybe you were too nice. If I'm a Republican senator or a Republican Congress, I think you're a very nice guy but I don't have enough reason to fear you.""But on the day of the Trump-Trudeau news conference, Moran went on Twitter to hail former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Fergus Cullen for ""ripping the sh*t out of Stephen Miller's (and POTUS) claims of massive voter fraud in NH."" He then retweeted thirteen tweets in which Cullen mocked Trump's voter fraud claims with pop culture references from ""The Simpsons"" to ""The Partridge Family.'Exhibit B is Brian Williams, whose 2009 prime-time Obama White House special featured a trip for cheeseburgers (What a regular guy, that Obama!) and good night handshakes and bows. He said: ""Mr. President, that is your elevator. Thank you, sir. Have a good evening.""But when it came to pounding Trump and Flynn, Williams displayed his typically shameless audacity, complaining that ""no matter how robust the press corps covering the president, the president controls the flow and the topics in a de facto way by deciding who to call on and who not to call on.""Obama controlled his flow by calling on Williams.Exhibit C is CBS News promoting White House correspondent Major Garrett's lament. He said, ""The central personnel question hanging over the Trump White House was not asked.""That's especially rich coming from the network of Obama's ""60 Minutes"" sympathizers. Steve Kroft offered Obama five softball interviews in 2008 in which he skipped every social issue, from gays to abortion to quotas. He also skipped health care and climate. And he skipped Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers. Kroft threw ""hardballs"" like, ""Do you think the country is ready for a black president?"" Once he became president, Kroft graduated to asking, ""So have you gotten into a routine?""These exhibits could fill a floor of the Newseum. All you need to know is that journalists have an on-off switch for accountability. It was off for eight years. Now it's on, and they're lamely pretending it's always been on.

673,L,"The New York Times was correct in 2011 when it proclaimed that ""Saturday Night Live"" has no equal ""when it comes to stamping a politician in the public consciousness."" Republican politicians like former Gov. Sarah Palin were described as incapable of escaping the ""SNL"" treatment, and voters actually thought Palin uttered Tina Fey's satirical line ""I can see Russia from my house.""And yet, the NBC show couldn't seem to locate a comedic angle on President Barack Obama, as the Times noted after his third year in office. He came into the White House as his impersonator Fred Armisen lamely spoke over a cool jazz beat: ""I take my kids to school,/ I don't lose my temper,/ It's my only rule/ I keep it cool.""Hilarious it was not. It reeked of adoration.In 2012, ""SNL"" writer Jim Downey was still declaring Obama mockery impossible. He said: ""Obama doesn't give you much to grab onto. He's like a smooth rock face of perfect obsidian with no ledges or toeholds, and your job is to scale 200 feet of it.""""SNL"" boss Lorne Michaels routinely — and ridiculously — claims the show is nonpartisan. This came even after two cast members quite seriously sang the '60s ballad ""To Sir, With Love"" to a picture of Obama the night after Trump's inauguration. After finishing the song, they broke out a mug reading ""World's Greatest President.""Two weeks later, ""SNL"" lurched in the opposite direction, this time with a dark and very unfunny portrayal of Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway as the psychopathic Glenn Close character in ""Fatal Attraction."" Her love interest in the skit is CNN's Jake Tapper. The fake Conway writhed and moaned in a sexual way about forcing Tapper to put her on television. He surrenders after she holds a knife to his throat, but then she accidentally falls out the window to her death, only to peel herself off the sidewalk and pull herself together like a horror movie monster as she says grotesquely: ""I only have three lives left. See you on the news!""Reaction wasn't positive. ""Prediction: the White House will use that sexist skit to dismiss all criticisms of Conway and lying more broadly,"" tweeted liberal Daily Beast writer Olivia Nuzzi. She also said: ""Casting Kellyanne Conway as Glenn Close was a miscalculation on SNL's part. Will be interpreted as unfair and mean to a wife and mother.""Other liberals agreed. NBC's own Andrea Mitchell said it was ""Not Right."" The New York Times found that the skit was unfocused with a ""queasy edge of sexism.""On Monday morning, ABC brought on leftist Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah to praise the skit as empowering for liberals. He said: ""I think it was actually really well done, and I think in today's day and age, comedy is cathartic. We need to be laughing at the Trump administration. For those people who don't like the Trump administration, it's a release and makes you feel good. I think it's empowering.""ABC reporter Jonathan Karl disagreed. ""I don't think it was funny. It seemed to be incredibly mean-spirited. This is somebody who has young children,"" he said. ""What makes SNL so funny is when they cut a little bit toward the truth. That was just not an accurate portrayal of Conway. I mean, she is somebody who actually is pushed to do more television by the president. ... She has many more requests to go on television than those that she actually accepts. ""For months now, the media have thrown every kind of screwball at Conway, but she keeps hitting everything out of the park. They loathe her, and now they're trying to ruin her.Alec Baldwin and ""SNL"" have been poking fun at Trump mercilessly for months. Hard-hitting? Of course. Funny? You better believe it. Trump's supporters — and President Trump himself — should laugh. But what is being done to Kellyanne Conway is no laughing matter.

Others getting a lift included Rudolph Technologies (RTEC), MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS).The one contrarian was ASML Holding (ASML), which reported what initially seemed to be upbeat results. Early Wednesday, Netherlands-based ASML reported first-quarter earnings of $1.12 a share, up 115% year over year, on sales of $2.07 billion, up 36%. Analysts were expecting 99 cents and $1.93 billion.Shares climbed 2.3% to 133.71 in morning action on better-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings.

Despite the recent softness in handbag trends, all three major purse makers made the list.Rounding out the top 10 favorites list were Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors (KORS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), DSW (DSW) and Nordstrom (JWN).Still, it's perhaps worrying for brick-and-mortar-based retailers that their greatest online nemesis is also climbing the ranks.IBD'S TAKE: The Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs study is but another reflection of the ongoing existential crisis faced by retailers — but the situation has created potential shorting opportunities for investors.Amazon (AMZN) topped the list as men's favorite retailer across all categories, said Bloomberg, citing the report, which also bestowed Amazon with the title of ""Most-Loved Brand"" overall.The recent Piper Jaffray teen survey showed similar results: Amazon gained ground as the No. 1 preferred shopping website among teens, reaching 43% share, said analysts.""(Amazon) Prime adoption has increased across all income brackets in each of the past six surveys,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts in last week's note.L Brands rose 1.5% on the stock market today.

Slaves were ""immigrants"" who ""found inspiration in all those who had come before them""?!?!Oh, wait. That wasn't Ben Carson.Those remarks were made by another prominent African American — Barack Obama — who happened to be president at the time.Surely Obama's inept comparison raised hackles, too, right?Well, not exactly. In fact, Obama's remarks — which were contained in a written speech he read from a teleprompter at a naturalization ceremony on Dec. 15, 2015 — received widespread and fulsome praise.Various news accounts described Obama's speech as ""an impassioned defense of migrants,"" ""heartfelt,"" ""a soaring tribute to American history and values,"" ""a full-throated defense of a liberal immigration policy,"" ""a plea for Americans to remember poor treatment toward immigrants in the past and to not repeat it.""It's not as if these folks missed Obama's ""slaves were immigrants"" point. USA Today, in an article lauding the speech as ""a full-throated defense of a liberal immigration policy,"" noted that Obama ""recounted a litany of past abuses of immigrants, silently comparing them to today's environment: The forced immigration of African slaves, anti-Catholic discrimination exhibited in signs reading, 'No Irish need apply,' and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.""But since Obama was attacking Trump in that speech, everyone loved it. (Obama, as a matter of fact, compared slaves to immigrants on multiple other occasions.)Well, perhaps what Carson said was somehow far worse than what Obama said a year and a half ago to such high praise. Judge for yourself.  Here's Carson's actual remarks:Immigrants who came to America he said, had it tough. They worked ""not eight hours a day, but 10, 12, 16 hours a day. There was no such thing as a minimum wage. They worked not for themselves but for their sons, daughters, their grandsons and granddaughters that they might have an opportunity in this land. … There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships who worked even longer and even harder for less. But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great grandsons, great granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.""In our view, calling slaves immigrants is idiotic, no matter who says it, and no matter in what context. Immigrants voluntarily came to the U.S. in search of a better life. Slaves were forced here against their will and treated as property. No doubt those brought over to the U.S. as slaves hoped that their children would have a better life. Who doesn't? Beyond that, there is simply no comparison between the two groups, and no reason to lump them together.But to all those now viciously attacking Carson, we'd ask: Why were you silent — or worse, signing praises — when the president of the United States said basically the same thing a year and a half ago?RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Public Turned Off By Media's Relentlessly Negative Coverage Of TrumpAfter Ignoring Obama Scandals For 8 Years, Reporters Are Making Them UpTrump News & Tweets

682,L,"On March 16, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly pushed into a boys bathroom at Rockville High School in Maryland and raped by two other students during school hours. Police arrested two freshmen who recently arrived from Central America, 18-year-old Henry Sanchez and 17-year-old Jose Montano. Sanchez, a Guatemalan, has a pending ""alien removal"" case against him. Montano, from El Salvador, is a minor, so his immigration status was not released.The Washington Post reported, ""The two took turns holding the girl down and sexually assaulting her as she cried out, fought back and repeatedly told them to stop, according to police affidavits filed in court.""Montano and Sanchez were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. This inflammatory story about immigrants was seen as Trump-reinforcing news, so ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and MSNBC aerobically avoided it. CNN mentioned it once in passing for about 100 words.A reporter for WTTG, the Fox News station in the nation's capital, asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on March 21 whether the reported crime would change government policy that insists public schools can't discriminate in admitting students based on their immigration status. Spicer replied: ""It is horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. ... I think part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.""But none of these networks could be shamed into caring.CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter actually criticized Fox for making the Rockville alleged rape a national story. He said: ""Rapes and assaults and murders are local news stories on a daily basis. But when do they break through to become national news, and when do they not?"" According to him, Fox pumped up the story to help President Trump.Stelter then cited the story of an alleged white supremacist from Baltimore who drove to New York City and stabbed and killed a 66-year-old black man, saying, ""But this story received almost no coverage on Fox or CNN or anywhere else, for that matter — another example of a crime, but not a crime that fit the political agenda of those pro-Trump hosts on Fox.""He was wrong. ABC gave that crime three stories over a 24-hour period, and NBC reported it briefly. One reason for its low profile may not be political. The New York Times first reported that murder in a local ""About New York"" column by Jim Dwyer on page A-19.But CNN's Brian Lowry underlined Stelter's point, saying: ""It really dovetailed with the theme Fox wanted to push: Fox's immigration agenda. ... And I also think the fact that they could use it to buttress their point that this is the kind of coverage you won't get on other media, that's just a win-win for them.""This is the liberal blindness that the ""news"" czars demonstrate. An immigrant convicted of raping or killing someone is an inconvenient fact if you're a liberal, but it's a fact. Somehow, the girl allegedly raped in Rockville is not a fact, just as Kate Steinle being murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant was not a fact. The left must always define what the relevant ""facts"" are, and its supposedly overflowing compassion will never reach the victims of inconvenient crimes.

683,L,"One might think that Fortune would want to keep a sober reputation as a magazine for business executives. But it made a fool of itself. It came out with a list of ""The World's 50 Greatest Leaders,"" and on that list was once-a-week late-night TBS ""comedy"" scold Samantha Bee.It's one thing when a news magazine is hunting for cultural influencers — and the left always picks its favorite people, whether or not they actually sway anyone outside the liberal bubble. But the fiercely feminist ""Full Frontal"" hostess isn't a leader, unless you mean she's one of America's greatest Trump-era producers of rage and bitterness.As might be suspected, the left-leaning Fortune editors selected Bee (and ranked her No. 19, ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts) because they're making quota picks. The hip-shaking Colombian singer Shakira also made the list. Bee was selected as a ""rare female voice"" in the gaggle of late-night liberals.Writer Tom Huddleston Jr proclaimed: ""Bee became an essential voice in late-night television in 2016 with the debut of her TBS show ... and the Canadian-born Bee used her show as a weekly platform for dispensing incisive and often provocative political commentary while standing out as a rare female voice in an overwhelmingly male late-night landscape.""Huddleston also argued that Bee has regularly triumphed over ""The Daily Show"" in ratings, which isn't much of a triumph (and ignores the fact that her show airs at 10:30 p.m., a half-hour before ""The Daily Show""). She loses routinely to Sean Hannity, and he's not named one of the greatest leaders.By the very nature of television, a vast majority of Americans have not defined Bee as an ""essential voice"" in their lives. Liberals call Bee ""incisive and often provocative"" because those are the adjectives they choose for her mocking a man at the Conservative Political Action Conference for having ""Nazi hair,"" and then having to apologize because he has cancer.The danger of naming Bee a world leader is she'll actually think she's doing something mature and serious, instead of scribbling hateful graffiti on the wall.Bee and her writing partner, Jo Miller, gave an interview to Virginia Heffernan at Wired magazine, who hailed them saying, ""they're not trapped by the creaky machinery of equal time, false equivalency, and sham neutrality.""Miller declared war on Team Trump, saying: ""It's gonna be a long war. And we have to pull our head out of our American ass. This is a global shift. So it's important that we tell real stories on our show."" Bee then added: ""Everything's grounded in research and journalism. We have a team of journalists working here, and a fact-checker. We care deeply about facts.""Even Heffernan was wondering about that, asking whether someone could think they're speaking literally and not metaphorically if Bee says things like ""they have their hands on our vaginas."" Bee's blasts do not dwell heavily on facts. She has said that Sen. Ted Cruz is a ""fish-faced horses--- salesman;"" that former Gov. Mitt Romney was ""soiling his temple garments at the thought of brokered convention""; and that the Republican convention was a ""rage-a-thon featuring a parade of hemorrhoidal has-beens.""If Bee cares deeply about facts, there's not much room for them in between the harangues. If this show is ""grounded in research and journalism,"" then journalism is dead, and research is deader. The magazines that celebrate Bee the ""world leader"" are next.

685,L,"Has the stock market taken its skis off for a breather? Or does a spread-eagled spill lie ahead? Those questions niggle at ETF investors as U.S. stocks stall for the second time since the Nov. 8 election, but perhaps they should not cause undue concern.Smart ETF investors, like the best skiers, don't get stuck looking at the tips of their skis. They push forward when fear creeps in, taking in the full view of the landscape, refining their action plan, and trusting themselves to make a successful run.That is what Herb Morgan, the founder, CEO and CIO of Efficient Market Advisors, is doing. His outlook for the second quarter is cautious, but a wider perspective of political shifts under President Trump and global economic conditions makes him bullish on stocks for the year ahead.""Beyond Q2, we expect to begin to see the positive impact of the pro-business agenda start to hit the bottom line,"" said Morgan, whose San Diego-based registered investment advisor (RIA) firm has a long track record of investing in ETFs and $1.15 billion in assets under management.Here are Morgan's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:At Efficient Market Advisors, we think the second quarter could be one of those periods where stock market performance diverges from economic performance. We are decidedly in the camp that sees a pickup in U.S. and global economic activity. However, we also believe that financial asset prices fully reflect this reality.The global economic uptick, while led by the U.S., is seeing other nations and regions begin to participate. It was fueled initially by massive central bank liquidity, but we now see a growing willingness to accept that monetary policy alone cannot manage an economy.In the U.S., this realization has led to an election which swept to power policymakers set on pro-growth fiscal policies. We see a strong benefit from tax reform, regulatory reform, repatriation of foreign profits and a possible large-scale infrastructure program. Other G-7 nations and beyond are experiencing similar shifts in political sentiments.Because of this, the markets have gotten rather optimistic and have priced risk assets appropriately. The S&P 500 now trades at 21.5 times earnings, while the Nasdaq Composite is at nearly 43 times earnings. Foreign markets are not immune to the lofty valuations and optimism. The FTSE 100 index is now at 30 times earnings on optimism over Brexit. Even the French CAC 40 index is at 19.5 times and Germany at 19.8 times.So, for valuation reasons only, we expect a modest equity market correction in the second quarter. Beyond Q2, we expect to begin to see the positive impact of the pro-business agenda start to hit the bottom line.These three ETFs could be poised to do well in the market conditions we anticipate.(Editor's note: ProShares Rising Inflation Expectations ETF is a fairly small fund with lower trading volume, but the liquidity of the underlying assets matters more to investment managers like Efficient's Morgan, who can transact in the primary market.)RELATED:3 Best ETFs For U.S. Stocks With Positive Momentum, High Dividends

690,L,"The defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is long past overdue. No president, including Ronald Reagan, has seriously pushed an immediate winding down of this corrupt and outdated waste of taxpayer funds. Who would have ever imagined that Donald Trump would be the first to do it?His first budget proposal takes that step, not just to save of ton of taxpayer money ($450 million is a lot of money) but also to establish a principle about our leftist media. It's simply not appropriate for the federal government to fund Democrat propaganda badly disguised as news.Is it any surprise, then, that the media have come unglued?CNN anchor Martin Savidge suggested Sunday that this proposal sounds like ""conservative revenge."" In September, we will mark the 50th anniversary of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which laughably proclaimed that the taxpayer-funded TV and radio stations of America would seek ""strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature.""There's no way to measure precisely how many billions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of hours of broadcast time conservatives would need to accomplish a tiny fraction of ""revenge"" for this long half-century march of leftist propaganda.If it is ""revenge"" for conservatives to demand an end to this charade, then we are guilty as charged.On CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" PBS President Paula Kerger was offered a platform to make ridiculous statements about how PBS is all about educating small children before kindergarten, and how the public should pay no attention to all the liberal ""educating"" they undertake in prime-time.Kerger made preposterous arguments with no rebuttal. Try the one where she said, ""Our entire programming operating budget is less than Netflix spends on the production of 'The Crown.'""She is picking possibly the most expensive television show ever made, with an estimated production budget of $130 million, but no matter. Now look at the 2016 Public Broadcasting Service and Subsidiaries financial statement. Under expenses, programming was listed as $380.3 million. In 2015, it was listed as $382.9 million.Kerger is playing accounting games with the term ""operating budget"" or the money sent to ""subsidiaries."" But for the people who watch PBS stations and pay the bills — involuntarily — it's a difference without a distinction. It's also their typical obfuscation. In a press statement, Kerger claimed that PBS is blandly defined as ""increasing school readiness for kids 2-8, support for teachers and homeschoolers, lifelong learning, public safety communications and civil discourse.""""Civil discourse"" is not the term many conservatives would associate with PBS. In reality, the harshest attacks on conservatives often come from the so-called Republicans on this network. Last year, ""PBS NewsHour"" pundit David Brooks slashed Sen. Ted Cruz for supposedly speaking in ""dark and satanic tones."" Brooks said, ""If you watch a Cruz speech, it's like ... we're going to stomp on this person, we're going to crush that person, we're going to destroy that person.""Over the years, there have been many wild leftist statements. PBS host Tavis Smiley insisted that Christians blow up people ""every day"" in America. In 1995, NPR's Nina Totenberg wished Sen. Jesse Helms or one of his grandchildren would die from AIDS as ""justice."" PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers proclaimed that Republicans wearing U.S. flag pins after 9/11 reminded him of Chinese communists carrying Mao's ""Little Red Book."" Moyers also oozed over paintings glorifying the Marxist revolutionaries ruling Nicaragua, saying, ""The white dove of freedom soars with the Sandinista revolution, whose heroes included Jesus Christ, George Washington and the nationalist hero Augusto Sandino.""Let the left-wing billionaires fund this left-wing propaganda. Conservatives are tired of funding our own (literal) demonizers.
"
691,L,"In October 1945, as he prepared to announce the signing of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Branch Rickey visited his friend, the well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas.""Branch, all hell will break loose!"" Thomas told Rickey, as recounted by Lee Lowenfish in ""Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman."" ""No, Lowell,"" Rickey replied. ""All heaven will rejoice.""Rickey, then the Brooklyn Dodgers' president and general manager, is remembered for his courage and foresight in breaking baseball's color line, the unofficial racial barrier which had stood firmly since the late 1800s. Robinson played his first game as a major leaguer 70 years ago this week.Rickey often said that he was drawn to the cause of racial equality when, in 1903, he observed Charles Thomas, the only black member of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, being denied a hotel room in South Bend, Ind. ""I never felt so helpless in my life,"" said Rickey.A 1949 Newsweek profile noted that Rickey spent ""two intensely secretive years"" considering the implications of breaking baseball's color barrier, not even informing the Dodgers' scouting department of his potential move.""When Robinson was signed, it effectively opened up the biggest pool of talent in history,"" said Daniel R. Levitt, co-author with Mark L. Armour of ""In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.""Rickey's innovations are seen throughout baseball today. He established the first ""farm system"" for developing major league talent and encouraged the use of statistical analysis in evaluating players. He promoted modern training methods and equipment.More broadly, Rickey elevated and exemplified the baseball general manager position, a role that most often had been taken on by an owner or team president. Under Rickey, it would include everything from player development to scouting.Rickey left an ""unmatched resume in the game,"" wrote Armour.  ""As a general manager he dramatically changed how teams find and develop players, and what players are allowed to play the game. His place as the greatest GM in baseball history is secure.""Wesley Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was born in Stockdale, Ohio, to Frank and Emily Rickey. Lowenfish writes that the family had a ""hardscrabble existence,"" trying to subsist on a vegetable farm.Born into a pious family, Rickey's name derived from John Wesley, a founder of Methodism. The name ""Branch"" came from scripture, possibly from a passage in the Old Testament.Rickey studied at Ohio Wesleyan, arriving on campus as ""the picture of the hayseed,"" according to Lowenfish, and experienced a difficult transition. He made his mark on both the football and baseball fields, showing ""plenty of pep and ginger"" as a catcher.In 1903, Rickey witnessed the stellar performance of Charles Follis, who is believed to have been the first black professional football player. Follis' on-field achievements, combined with his poise in the face of racial pressures, impressed Rickey, planting a seed for his determination years later to integrate baseball.After signing a minor league baseball contract in 1903, Rickey debuted in the majors with the St. Louis Browns in 1905. His playing career over four seasons was pedestrian. While catching, he allowed a stunning 13 stolen bases in a single game, setting a dubious record. Following an arm injury and a bout of tuberculosis, Rickey enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. He also became the baseball coach at Michigan.In 1913, Rickey became an executive for the Browns, signing future Hall of Famer George Sisler and later managing the team for more than two seasons. In 1919, Rickey joined the St. Louis Cardinals as team manager and president. In 1925, he was fired as manager by owner Sam Breadon, a serendipitous move which allowed Rickey to focus exclusively on being an executive.Rickey revamped the Cardinals' roster, laying the groundwork for six pennants and four World Series during his 24 seasons there. He quickly released players who did not meet his standards, turning around a previously mediocre franchise. Rickey acquired eventual stars Joe Medwick and brothers Dizzy and Daffy Dean, who shaped the Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang"" in the 1930s.Though Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was dismissive of Rickey's farm system, fearing it would destroy the existing structure, Rickey used it to great success.  The World Series-winning 1942 Cardinals were built with players Rickey's system developed, including Stan Musial, the best player in franchise history.Rickey reshaped the entire organization:""The farm system allowed Rickey to institute the 'Cardinal Way,' "" said Levitt.  ""It was an organizational philosophy extending from the lowest farmhands to the Major League team. It instituted organizationwide training techniques and defined what sort of players the team's scouts would seek.  There became a pride in being a Cardinal. Rickey was the first baseball executive to develop this kind of organizational framework.""Rickey joined the Dodgers before the 1943 season. The core players of Brooklyn's six World Series teams between 1947 and 1956 were acquired and developed under Rickey. With Brooklyn, Rickey hired the first team statistician, opened a team spring training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., and implemented new training techniques, including the use of pitching machines.Rickey was acutely aware that he needed to sign the right player to break baseball's color barrier.""Mr. Rickey knew he needed a superb player or the man wouldn't stand a chance,"" said Carl Erskine, a member of the Dodgers from 1948 through 1959 and a teammate of Jackie Robinson for nine seasons. ""Robinson was a four-letter man at UCLA. His best sport may have been football, not baseball.  And he had to be intelligent.  Jackie certainly was.""Mr. Rickey said to Jackie: 'If a fight starts on the field, I'm picking you. You're quicker, you're faster, and you're stronger. You're going to win the fight. But are you strong enough not to fight? You must tell me that you're willing to commit yourself not to fight.' When Jackie said, 'I think I can do it,' Mr. Rickey read to him a paraphrased version of 'Turn the Other Cheek,' a verse in the Bible, about having the courage to resist.""Rickey, according to Erskine, stressed the Christian faith of both of their mothers in making his plea and offer to Robinson. ""That was a critical moment, often unmentioned in history, when Jackie made the commitment.""Robinson, who debuted 70 years ago this week, was National League Rookie of the Year in 1947 and led Brooklyn to the World Series. Robinson's struggles and triumphs are an integral part of American history, and his importance to baseball and its growth is immense.Rickey encouraged Cleveland to sign Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, because he did not want to ""corner the market on black players,"" wrote Lowenfish.""Mr. Rickey unselfishly gave up a Hall of Famer for the American League to be integrated,"" said Erskine. ""That was selfless and is too often forgotten.""The African-American players whom Rickey signed, including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, were central to Brooklyn's success throughout the 1950s. After losing a power struggle, Rickey left the Dodgers for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1950. While the team struggled during his time as general manager, Rickey acquired many of the top players on Pittsburgh's 1960 World Series-winning team, including Roberto Clemente.""There was no one quite as good at seeing greatness in raw talent,"" Lowenfish told IBD. ""In evaluating players and hiring quality scouts, nobody quite matches Rickey.""But, while his farm system allowed him to acquire players cheaply, ""he was hated because he made the money and the players didn't,"" said Lowenfish. Erskine said that Rickey was often referred to as El Cheapo, connoting a reputation for miserliness which Rickey had difficulty shaking, even though he sometimes spent profusely on players.Some suggested that Rickey's decision to sign Robinson also had underlying financial motivations.  Others criticized Rickey for never coming to the ballpark on Sundays, as he honored the Sabbath to pay homage to his mother.Erskine said that Rickey tested players, trying to learn how they processed information.""He helped many players excel, through his patience and his unique methods. In spring training, he used to talk to players as they worked out. He wanted to see if you had aptitude.""He had a $5 bill which he'd lay on home plate. He'd say: 'Son, I want you to throw the ball with your hand backwards to the plate. If you can hit that $5, you can have it.' He often gave us little tests which helped him make judgments about players. He wanted to know if you could learn unconventionally.""On Dec. 9, 1965, Rickey died at age 83 of heart failure in Columbia, Mo. Nearly a month earlier, he had collapsed while giving a speech during his induction to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and five daughters.""Mr. Rickey was a human dynamo,"" said Erskine. ""He truly kept going until he stopped.""Rickey's most prominent contribution will always be signing Robinson to break baseball's color barrier:""To me, Rickey and Robinson were the right combination,"" said Lowenfish.

692,L,"Just as the liberal ""news"" media have doubled down on fierce liberal activism since President Trump's inauguration, Hollywood is pushing the leftist agenda. Variety celebrates the crusade — that is what this is — in an article headlined ""TV Gets Woke: How Scripted Series Are Confronting Social Issues Like Never Before.""It is not that Hollywood should be political; it is that the industry must be political. Even the sitcoms need to be political. ""Social media is in a constant conversation about things,"" proclaimed NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke. ""It doesn't feel authentic to not address what's going on in the world and what people are really talking about. I think that's a sweet spot for comedy in general.""She points to ""The Carmichael Show"" on NBC, which, like so many series advancing left-wing causes, is not a hit but features plots about hot topics like gentrification. A character defined it saying: ""Gentrification is essentially when developers look at a neighborhood the way Richard Gere looked at Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman.' You know, you see past all the flaws of the past. You see a perfect spot for a Starbucks or an Ethiopian restaurant run by non-Ethiopians.""This is what John Q. Public wants when he wants to watch TV? (Did we just say ""he""?)The new CBS show ""Superior Donuts"" features one episode plot wherein the neighborhood dry-cleaning shop owned by an Iraqi-American (played by Muslim comedian Maz Jobrani) is vandalized with graffiti that says, ""Arabs Go Home."" Naturally, another character says to Jobrani's character, ""I'm going to miss you when America is great again.""ABC's ""Black-ish"" drew liberal praise for a January episode in which the black characters confronted the Trump victory. ""We didn't just want to be a family comedy show,"" Anthony Anderson, one of the show's stars, explained. ""We wanted to be substantive and have a conscience and have something to say without beating you over the head with that message.""That depends on how you define ""beating you over the head."" Decide for yourself. During the episode, when a white woman says she voted for Trump, she is shamed for hating women. She fights back by suggesting that since blacks wouldn't vote for Dr. Ben Carson just based on race, she wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton. The black characters slam Carson, saying, ""Dude is a weirdo,"" and ""Is he even black?"" A character played by Wanda Sykes adds, ""As long as she knows that a vote for Trump is a vote for racism!"" When the Trump voter protests saying, ""I have black friends!"" the blacks collectively howl. One hectors, ""It's racist to say that!""The lectures come in the dramas, too. Fox has a new drama coming soon called ""Shots Fired,"" inspired by the Trayvon Martin shooting and the Black Lives Matter movement. Co-creators Reggie Bythewood and Gina Prince-Bythewood were recruited by Fox after the Ferguson riots. ""It's not enough to preach to the choir,"" Gina Prince-Bythewood told Time magazine. ""You have to speak to everybody.""She told Variety: ""these things were fueling us in wanting to say something to the world, and how we could use our art as a weapon to speak on this. ... One of the mantras we have is that anyone can portray reality, but an artist portrays what reality should be.""Their show was filmed before the election, and since then, ""there's been a 180-degree change,"" says Prince-Bythewood. ""Now the Dept. of Justice is absolutely under siege under this new administration. Will it even have the ability or the desire to look into cases of injustice?""They have consulted with experts like former President Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and, for supposed balance, former New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly. But there will be no balance. As seen on ""Black-ish,"" they may have a marginally sympathetic white character to offer some sign that they've listened before filming. But that nagging ideological temptation to use your art as a weapon is sure to come barging through the TV again and again. And again.RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

693,L,"Time magazine has singled out White House strategist Steve Bannon for its Darth Vader cover treatment. Shown is a picture of Bannon looking like a Marvel Comics villain and the title ""The Great Manipulator."" Bannon dared to identify the liberal media as ""the opposition party."" Time took offense and demonstrably proved him right.Demonizing the president's aides is something Time and its liberal ilk have not done to Democrats since the days of President Jimmy Carter, when Time was liberal but not nearly as leftist as it is today. At this point eight years ago, the same magazine was profiling President Obama's aide Larry Summers as the ""brash and brilliant economic advisor,"" the ""economic wunderkind ... moving at flank speed"" who speaks with ""an almost poetic clarity.""Obama was always center stage. No evil wizard manipulated him from behind the curtains. That only happens under apparently ""manipulated"" dolts like President Reagan, President George W. Bush and now, President Trump.The new article is headlined ""The second most powerful man in the world? Steve Bannon has the President's ear. But he wants more."" For Trump, Bannon is ""a director who deploys ravenous sharks, shrieking tornadoes and mushroom clouds as reliably as John Ford shot Monument Valley.""Decades ago, Time shredded the notion that it is a news magazine, steadily becoming evermore politicized. It's a badly disguised journal of rampaging liberal opinion. But it is a stubborn pretender. It insists that its brand of liberal advocacy passes as acceptably objective inside today's news business, and it's right, of course.Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs unfurled a nasty gram at Bannon in her ""From the Editor"" letter up front. She cited Bannon's ""opposition party"" comment and then spat, ""To demonize the press, to characterize it as not just mistaken but malign, is to lay the groundwork for repression.""These people dish out criticism, but wow, are they incapable of taking it. Criticize Trump, and you are Honorable Dissent. Criticize the media, and you are Nazi Dictatorship.Gibbs thinks her magazine is serenely centrist and objective, which makes her a fool. Lest anyone take offense, consider the alternative: If not a fool, she'd be a raging liar. She boasts: ""At a time when the media is ever more fractured and siloed, and much of it partisan on both sides, TIME is one of the few remaining institutions that speaks to a broad and global audience. ... Our purpose is not to tell people what to think; it is to help them decide what to think about.""Someone should please make an appointment to meet with Ms. Gibbs for two minutes and simply show her the Time cover of Trump's face melting, and the cover of Trump's face melting into a puddle. Is one not to conclude a wee bit of hostility toward Trump? How traumatically gullible does Time think America is?This kind of bloviation is especially nonsensical coming from Gibbs. Take her valentine to Obama after his first victory. She placed him on par with Christ, saying: ""Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers. But a few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope."" What a bottle of ipecac.Then there's Gibbs on President Bill Clinton during the Monicagate scandal. She said: ""In the gaudy mansion of Clinton's mind there are many rooms with heavy doors, workrooms and playrooms, rooms stuffed with trophies, rooms to stash scandals and regrets. He walks lightly amid the ironies of his talents and behavior, just by consigning them to different cubbies of his brain. It's an almost scary mind, that of a multitasking wizard.""Put a cork in it. The jig has been up for 30 years. No one's buying the outraged protests of nonpartisanship. What Time is claiming to be news is the very definition of fake news.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center.

701,L,"It doesn't matter what your preferred communication style is, it's not about you. If you're speaking in a way that people can't understand or that offends them, your message will not get across.That's from Anna Conrad, founder of development and consulting firm Impact Leadership Solutions.Attorney Damian L. Albergo of the law firm Cole Schotz adds that the power of simply spelling things out in writing at the outset can save the headache of a business dispute.Tips on making sure your message is received loud and clear:Think before speaking. Be cognizant of the intent of your words and the reactions of others, Conrad emphasizes.""Avoid the temptation to think out loud,"" she said. ""Ask questions before you give your opinion.""Walk in their shoes. Conrad, author of ""(R)evolution: One Man's Leadership Journey,"" paraphrases business guru Stephen Covey in saying ""we judge ourselves by our intent, but others judge us by our actions."" She says you can only say ""I'm sorry"" or ""I didn't mean that"" so many times before people stop listening.""Most people don't mean to be jerks,"" Conrad said. ""Most people don't even realize when their behavior has crossed the line. And if you asked them, they will often complain that others are too sensitive. After all, it's just business. But aren't people a main part of a business? Without people there would be no business and no leaders.""Determine your role. In order to communicate effectively in business, Conrad says, it's important for people to understand when they are functioning as practitioners (those doing the work), as managers (those coordinating it), or as leaders (those looking at the bigger picture, being visionary and developing people).She's found that for most people the comfort zone is as a practitioner, and that's not always a positive. ""Although a manager may think rolling up her sleeves motivates her direct reports by showing she is part of the team, this may send the message that she doesn't trust them.""Conrad advises that you determine your role by what's needed in a given situation: a practitioner, a manager or a leader.Spell it out. Conflict is a given, even in the most well-run businesses, Albergo says. He recommends taking a proactive, written approach to communication to help reduce costly intracompany disputes.That includes executing a written operating agreement with a partner or partners that ""describes how the business will be managed and includes mechanisms for resolving disputes should partners become deadlocked,"" he said.Clarify financial compensation. Since business partners often provide seed money to get their ventures off the ground, ""defining how that money will be treated — whether it is a capital contribution or a loan — is crucial,"" Albergo said.If, for example, the seed money is to be treated as a loan, ""having a written promissory note spelling out the interest rate and repayment terms is beneficial,"" he added.Define responsibilities. Some partners play an active role in the business while others act as silent ones.Whether and to what extent a partner is involved in day-to-day operations should be spelled out in the company's governing agreement or elsewhere, Albergo says. ""If a partner is to receive a salary and benefits in addition to profits interest, the amount of the salary and benefits should be spelled out in writing and agreed upon at the outset.""Anticipate the unexpected. Decide for example how the buyout of a partner who becomes disabled or a payout to the estate of a deceased partner will be handled, Albergo said.""Investigate approaches to value the enterprise and select a valuation method that can be memorialized in the operating agreement,"" he added.Keep things simple. Having worked with thousands of leaders, Conrad said that ""almost all conflicts, misunderstandings, and missed deadlines come down to communication issues — usually between two people.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:Simple Ways To Cut Through Today's Tangle Of ComplexityAvoid These Entrepreneurs' Rookie MistakesTo Stay On Top, Here's How To Keep Reaching Higher

702,L,"The semiconductor industry showed strength Wednesday on several fronts, with chip gear maker ASML (ASML) soaring to a record high after an earnings beat, Broadcom (AVGO) also hitting an all-time high while regaining a buy point, Nvidia (NVDA) reversing to the upside and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) finding support at its 50-day line.ASML stock jumped 6.1% to 122.97 on the stock market today, hitting a new high for the first time since May 2015, after the company's Q1 guidance and Q4 results beat Wall Street expectations.The Netherlands-based company posted a 74% year-over-year rise in EPS to $1.29 as sales rose 29% from Q4 2015 to $2 billion. That was its best bottom-line showing in more than four years and its biggest top-line growth since Q2 2014.The company said it received orders for six EUV systems in the quarter, bringing its backlog to 18 EUVs. These multimillion-dollar extreme ultraviolet lithography systems are ASML's newest products, using concentrated light rays to etch circuitry onto silicon.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for gaming systems, self-driving cars and other end markets, has taken up residence at the top of the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.

703,L,"Shares of New Oriental Education (EDU) climbed early Tuesday after posting a solid second-quarter revenue beat and per-share profit that was in line with estimates.The China-based private education services heavyweight posted adjusted earnings of 8 cents per American depositary share on a 23% revenue bump to $341.2 million, well above forecasts for $329.4 million.Total student enrollment grew 56% to about 1.312 million in the second quarter, the company said.New Oriental stock gained 2.8% to close at 50.11 on the stock market today.New Oriental is China's largest private education company, offering K-12 subject tutoring and test-prep classes, and has recently come under fire for reportedly trying to give some of its students an unfair leg up when it comes to college-prep SAT exams.The company's quarterly results are the first to be disclosed in the wake of a Reuters investigation from late December that found New Oriental has ""regularly provided items from the (SAT) tests to clients shortly after the exams are administered."" The investigation found that practice could give New Oriental students an unfair advantage when it comes to taking the tests, since SAT exam material is frequently recycled.Earlier in December, a separate Reuters story reported current and former New Oriental employees accused the company of helping students engage in college application fraud. The Dec. 2 story prompted shares to tank 14.3% that day.IBD's TAKE: New Oriental isn't the only stock getting a lift Tuesday. Luxottica Group (LUX) and Reynolds American (RAI) are up on M&A moves. New Oriental, in a statement to Reuters, condemned ""illegal and illegitimate business practices,"" and said it would review the issue and discipline anyone in violation of its policies and procedures.Management did not comment on the issue in its earnings release.For the third quarter, the company expects $408.7 million to $421.8 million in revenue, with the midpoint just above current analyst estimates of $414.5 million.Peer TAL Education (TAL) inched up 2 cents to 75.68. Tal Education has formed a handle with a 77.87 buy point in a consolidation going back to late October.Tarena International (TEDU) rose 0.7% to 15.45, right on its 50-day moving average.

704,L,"Populism took the elites by surprise in 2016, so a review of this year's cultural winners and losers must begin with a very long list of arrogant entertainers who thought it was completely impossible for the American people to descend into a pit of despair and ignorance and elect Donald Trump. No one believed for a second the rich-and-famous losers who promised to move their arrogance to Canada or elsewhere if the Hillary Clinton juggernaut were to tank.Right behind them on the losers list is the liberal journalist Mark Miller at Esquire, who actually scolded celebrities like Taylor Swift and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson for staying out of the Clinton endorsement game. This somehow showed that they rejected ""the very values that make them human.""The first winner is the reality-TV star himself: Donald Trump. NBC probably had no idea it was creating its own political horror movie by broadcasting ""The Apprentice"" and ""Celebrity Apprentice"" for 14 seasons, touting Trump as the ""ultimate businessman."" A Media Research Center Business study found 335 NBC News stories on Trump's business empire from 2004 to 2015, and only 15 of them were negative.Loser: Barack Obama movies. Liberal newspaper critics loved ""Southside with You,"" an 81-minute film loosely based on the first date of President Obama and Michelle Obama. The actual date didn't last much longer than the movie. It flopped at the box office, earning only $6.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.Loser: Michael Moore. Speaking of box-office flops, Moore's downward spiral continued. His tiresome documentary ""Where to Invade Next"" (touting socialist wonders of the world) only grossed a reported $3.8 million. But that looked like a bonanza next to ""Michael Moore in Trumpland,"" an anti-Trump screed released late in the campaign season. It reportedly grossed less than $150,000.Winner: animated movies and comic-book spinoffs. The Box Office Mojo list of top-grossing movies continues to be dominated by these two formulas. ""Finding Dory"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets"" were first and third, and ""Captain America: Civil War"" was second. The top 10 also included ""Zootopia"" and the comic-book movies ""Deadpool,"" ""Doctor Strange,"" ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.""Winner: transgender propaganda products. ""The Danish Girl,"" a fictionalized account of the first man to undergo a sex-change operation, led to an Oscar for Alicia Vikander, who played the man's supportive wife. The Amazon web show ""Transparent"" was showered with TV awards again. And ABC's ""Modern Family"" made ""history"" by featuring an 8-year-old girl (a transgender boy) to raise our awareness of gender fluidity.Loser: Colin Kaepernick. The liberal elites rallied to the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who kneeled during the national anthem before games, declaring that he could not ""show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color."" Photos showed this disgraceful ingrate wearing socks featuring pigs with police hats during training camp. He's ""led"" the 49ers to a terrible 2-13 record so far.Winner: Olympic pole vaulter Sam Kendricks, a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve who caused a viral-video moment after Kaepernick's brazen gesture. During the games in Rio de Janeiro, he stopped abruptly mid-charge down the runway when he heard the national anthem playing in the stadium. He dropped his pole and stood at attention until the song finished. That kind of respect for the flag and the military is still popular, despite the liberal elites.

707,L,"It shouldn't be considered remarkable that all three major broadcast networks offered a news story on the tens of thousands who came for the 2017 March for Life. But it is. Between the morning and evening shows, the networks gave it almost 22 minutes of airtime altogether. To illustrate how shocking that number is, consider that last year, ABC gave the march 35 seconds of coverage. NBC ignored it altogether. Ditto for CBS.There are two obvious reasons for this change. First, unlike the Reagan administration or the two Bush administrations, the Trump administration made modern history by sending speakers — two top-shelf speakers — Vice President Pence and top White House advisor Kellyanne Conway. Both were eloquent additions who made it an obvious news event.The second was the media's massive coverage of the Women's March on Washington, which came one day after President Trump's inauguration, and the demand that some sort of balance be shown. But it wasn't. The networks gave that march more than 75 minutes of coverage, about 3.4 times as much as the pro-life rally. In fact, they gave the leftist protest 23 minutes of promotion before it even happened.For liberal journalists, the inauguration was depressing, and the Saturday march was the happy news. As Time's Karl Vick wrote in a 10-page spread about the liberal protesters, ""Many said it was the best they've felt since Election Day."" Left out of that narrative was the way leftists behave when they feel good: Some went to the march dressed as vaginas. At least one held a 3-foot-tall penis sign. Speakers hurled obscenities across the National Mall. Madonna expressed her thoughts of bombing the White House.Now let's reverse the equation and take you back to 2009. The March for Life took place two days after President Obama's first inauguration, and tens of thousands of protesters were present. It surely gave many social conservatives their best feeling since Election Day, bonding them in common cause as Obama and Democratic majorities in Congress were arrayed against them. And guess what happened. ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS aired nothing. Time and Newsweek reported nothing. The New York Times printed nothing — for the second year in a row.So if the perceived futility of these conservative protesters made the event less than newsworthy eight years ago, that logic should have held for the Women's March in 2017. But neither logic nor balance are at play here. All that matters for the press is how does it make me feel? And how does it help us win?Let's face it. The left thinks it owns the act of protesting. And to the left, the idea of conservative protests is an oxymoron. It can't possibly be sincere or representative of a movement.Back in 2009, these liberal networks tried to ignore tea party rallies across America, and when they couldn't ignore them, they dismissed the crowds as undemocratic tools of capitalist puppet masters. ABC's Dan Harris relayed, ""Critics on the left say this is not a real grassroots phenomenon at all, that it's largely orchestrated by people fronting for corporate interests."" On NBC, Chuck Todd said: ""There's been some grassroots conservatives who have organized so-called tea parties around the country. ... But I tell you, the idea hasn't really caught on.""Now, hopeful liberal journalists are suggesting that the Women's March could be the tea party movement that will elect a Democratic wave in the 2018 midterm elections. Just remember that these same networks suggested that Sen. Wendy Davis was going to ride a blue wave through Texas a few years back after her ""epic filibuster"" against an abortion bill in 2013. She ran for governor in 2014 and lost by more than 20 points. As President Trump just proved again, the liberal media are so closely tied to the far left that they've lost touch with America.
"
708,L,"The retail industry is facing an existential crisis — and not while mired in the depths of recession, but as the economy notches its eighth year of expansion.XIn March alone, Sears Holdings (SHLD), the parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said ""substantial doubt"" exists about its survival prospects after losing more than $10 billion over six years and watching sales fall for even longer. Urban Outfitters (URBN) likened the troubled industry to a housing bubble that has popped. And Bloomberg reported that women's apparel chain Bebe Stores (BEBE) plans to close all its 168 stores and go online only. (On Wednesday, it said it will close 21 stores and explore options for the rest.)As retailers take a hard look at the future in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN), investors face a big question of their own: Are retail stocks just flat-out doomed?No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come.A Yardeni Research report estimated that online shopping has grown to 29.1% of retail sales of items like general merchandise, apparel and accessories, and furniture — but not autos and fuel. That's up from less than 10% in the late 1990s. Over the same period, department stores' share of sales withered to 12.6% from around 30%.Still, companies that sell things within walls, floors and ceilings still have options in a $4 trillion market.""There's no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,"" said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. ""That's just not going to happen.""Analysts say physical stores can still be vital in a connected, buy-anywhere, retail-everywhere world, with chains experimenting with new uses for their locations and even e-commerce companies seeing the value of in-store experiences.""There's plenty they can do,"" Roster said of retailers. ""The question is: Will they do it?""Meanwhile, the weight has accumulated on retail stocks. Take Macy's (M), which earlier had been praised for its aggressive efforts to integrate online and in-store operations. The department store's shares have lost more than half their value since July 2015. Earnings and sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters.L Brands (LB), whose Victoria's Secret brand ought to be more insulated from e-commerce, has seen its stock halved since late 2015. The SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) has fallen some 20% over the past two years.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks trending below their declining 200-day moving averages offer shorting opportunities. For example, Macy's is struggling to get back in the 30s, but that would set up yet another test of the 50-day average and a possible short entry. Dillard's has stumbled this year, down as much as 25%, and just got turned away from its 50-day. See if it can hold support at 46.56.As those trends have solidified, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who prides himself on being a long-term investor, divested almost all his stake in Wal-Mart (WMT) in Q4. He told CNBC in February that ""the online thing is very hard to figure out, you know?""Amazon, Buffett said, was a company ""that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they've got delighted customers.""""Now, Wal-Mart's pushing forward online themselves and they've got all kinds of strengths,"" he later added. ""But I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.""For much of the past 60 years, retail was an easier game. The postwar population explosion held consumerism aloft for years, says Doug Stephens, founder and CEO of retail advisory service Retail Prophet. When baby boomers' spending slowed as they reached their 50s, growth in personal credit — spurred by financial deregulation — helped pick up the slack, or at least masked weaker trends, he says.""It allowed a lot of retailers to get away with being pretty average,"" Stephens said. ""The average American aspired to be average. They aspired to the middle-class average lifestyle, and retailers like JCPenney (JCP) and Sears and others were happy to accommodate them by selling average goods and average prices with average experiences.""Then the financial crisis and recession hit. The resulting consumer flight to either luxury or deep discounting hollowed out retail's middle-of-the-road set, he added.That has left the retail industry with too many stores, not enough shoppers, and more bankruptcies. Sports Authority was liquidated last year. Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and disclosed plans to close 400 stores. Markets are wondering if Sears and JCPenney are next.U.S. retail square footage per capita is more than six times that in Europe or Japan, Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said in March. Deutsche Bank in February estimated that among the retailers it follows, more than 13,100 stores will have closed during the decade ending this year. The analysis indicated that 6,400-plus locations could still be pruned from those companies' store counts.With more companies clearing out of their store space, malls can try to re-anchor their properties with grocery stores and fill in other spots with restaurants and fitness centers. The anchor stores tend to draw foot traffic, but their long stretches of square footage make those spaces hard to fill, Deutsche Bank analysts say.""Fewer retail stores should translate into a direct decline in the number of viable retail properties, including malls,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Ed Reardon and Simon Mui wrote in February. ""An enclosed mall can quickly reach a 'tipping point' where a decline in foot traffic leads to further closures and rent declines (aka the mall death spiral).""And yet the store persists, with even e-commerce companies recognizing its value. In fact, the physical store is still an efficient way to grab customers, especially as the cost of acquiring them online has gone up, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said.Nordstrom's (JWN) Trunk Club, an e-commerce site that delivers clothing according to the wearer's tastes, has opened physical stores in recent years. Amazon has opened pop-up stores and plans to launch grocery stores.The pop-up, often backed by heavy online promotion, can also lend brick-and-mortar retailers flexibility and intrigue.""When you start to see a pop-up store by Amazon, that to me validates (the idea) that there is still a place for a brick-and-mortar, touch-and-feel type of retail experience,"" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce.Newcomers to the business, particularly in clothing, also found different ways to retail, like using real-time data and greasing their supply chains to respond more quickly to fashion trends, said Peter Dixon, who runs a number of consumer discretionary-focused funds at Fidelity, noting that it was shortsighted for some retailers to blame their problems solely on the rise of e-commerce.""Hiring star merchants to forecast fashion trends 12 months ahead of time and then commit to inventory orders nine months in advance of a season?"" he said. ""It just doesn't seem to work on a consistent basis anymore.""IBD'S TAKE: Other potential shorts include Ralph Lauren, whose stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average. A decisive move below 75 would dump it at the lowest levels in nearly seven years. And L Brands last touched its 10-week moving average in December. Wait for an attempted rebound to that line before betting on another plunge.What may work, after retailers shrink their real-estate footprint, is a hybrid approach to stores that accommodates online orders and has more attractive floor space.Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.Macy's and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has tried to stay digitally relevant through acquisitions. The company last year shelled out $3 billion for online discounter Jet.com. In March, Wal-Mart acquired ModCloth, which sells indie-and-retro-leaning women's apparel. Wal-Mart in February also bought online outdoor-gear retailer Moosejaw.Long-term, the ratio of apparel retailers' physical-store and online purchases could reach 50/50, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar says. Along with a bigger focus on e-commerce, analysts stress the importance of shrinking store-counts and using the remaining stores as areas that are more ""experiential.""Several chains are trying different things along those lines, though their ability to replicate such formats on a large scale is questionable:""Specialty stores often know their customers on a personal level more closely than big-box stores do, but retailers like Target, Sears, and Wal-Mart also break up their stores into departments,"" Caporaso said over email. ""They can therefore create experiential services in those areas that target specific subsections of their customer bases.""Stephens, of the Retail Prophet, said stores could apply the pop-up approach to the way they handle in-store experiences, replenishing them several times a year to give consumers a reason to return.Such experiential offerings also speak to one of Amazon's weaknesses, especially as it picks up more merchants.""If you want a white T-shirt, and you search for a white T-shirt, you're going to get thousands of results at all different price points, and no one wants to weed through that,"" Weishaar said.She and others say that retailers that can both build out their online infrastructure and maintain a unique identity are the most likely to weather the current storm of falling sales and fleeing investors.""They'll be fine as long as they have a coolness to them,"" said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. ""Amazon will never be cool. It's just efficient and easy.""

710,L,"When Congress returns in January, the Democrats will be gunning for several of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees. The left has already launched negative narratives on several, especially Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Trump's pick for attorney general. Not only are the left-wing news media giving oxygen to these vitriolic attacks but in some cases they are the very authors.On the front page on Christmas Day, both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post published ""profile"" stories on Sessions obsessing over racial matters. The Times headline promised an exploration of his ""thorny history on race.""Times reporter Del Quentin Wilber set the stage, saying: ""As a boy, Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III began each day before dawn, boarding a segregated bus to his all-white school. En route he and his classmates passed the bus ferrying black students in the opposite direction. The day ended when he sat down to dinner each night with his father, an avowed segregationist.""And just like that, Sessions has a racist past.Wilber admitted, ""By all accounts, Sessions has enjoyed lifelong friendships with African Americans, is respected by former black employees and has even earned recent praise from a top black state legislator."" But even so -- he just couldn't leave it there -- ""the conservative Republican's policy positions, decisions as a prosecutor and racially tinged comments have led many civil rights advocates to fear how he would enforce the nation's anti-discrimination laws.""Wilber allowed that Sessions wishes he had been a stronger advocate for black civil rights in his youth but ""has not been able to shake questions about his views and positions on racial matters."" Liberal newspapers will not cease raising the questions and concerns that they don't have for the senator's Democratic colleagues.Take Rep. Keith Ellison, the far-left Muslim activist running to lead the Democratic Party. How many stories has the Times published since Election Day on Ellison's associations with radical Muslims and his militant positions against Israel? Zero. To beat a dead horse, just how concerned was the Times about the Ku Klux Klan membership of the late Sen. Robert Byrd?The Washington Post headline was ""For Jeff Sessions, history is inescapable."" That's unintentionally hilarious. The Post has excelled in making Obama's personal history -- drug use, buying a house with crook Tony Rezko, his 9/11 cheerleader pal Rev. Jeremiah Wright and so much more -- completely escapable.Post reporters Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz wrote, ""Sessions's long record in public life reveals a man who has hired African Americans for senior positions who speak highly of him, but"" -- here we go again -- ""who has been sharply criticized by civil rights groups for his positions on voting rights, same-sex marriage and gender equality.""So, to be pro-traditional marriage is to be anti-civil rights.
"
711,L,"Liberal newspapers never admit that their favorite civil rights advocates are solidly on the left and oppose Republicans pretty much across the board. The National Rifle Association is not a civil rights group in their book. Religious-liberties litigators fighting the Obama administration are not civil rights activists. One must subscribe to the tenets of the left to be an advocate for civil rights.Senators know Sessions and his record, including the bipartisan accomplishments. He worked with then-Sen. Ted Kennedy in 2003 to reduce assault inside prisons. He joined with Sen. Dick Durbin in 2009 to eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine. In 2011, he worked with Sen. Richard Blumenthal on a law to track down fugitive sex offenders.On civil rights, Sessions has been praised by numerous black leaders. As the Times mentioned in passing, they include Alabama House Minority Leader Quinton Ross.They tried a similar routine with John Ashcroft when he was nominated to lead the Justice Department 16 years ago. They tried to paint him as a racist for writing for a journal called the Southern Partisan. But eight Democrats crossed party lines to make it an easy confirmation vote. History is bound to repeat itself, but that won't stop these character assassins from trying.

714,L,"Amazon.com (AMZN) isn't attending the annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., but its presence was arguably felt in one way or another Tuesday morning.With holiday retail figures out — some tremendously disappointing to investors, others less so — and Amazon crowned the clear winner of Christmas by Slice Intelligence, the conference presents an opportunity to reflect on a modern shopping landscape pockmarked by growing online sales and subdued mall traffic.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) management said it was ""relatively happy"" with its real estate portfolio, calling it ""pretty healthy"" and noting that it doesn't feel particularly hurt by Macy's (M) recent announcement to close dozens of locations, despite having stores in those same areas.But an outperforming digital channel could prompt store closures anyway.""We're looking at things like digital penetration to brick-and-mortar sales within that region,"" said one executive at the conference. ""You know, if a store's in a C-mall location, for instance, and although we're still making money (but) we're seeing digital having a much higher penetration — you know, we might decide to close that store. ""He then said that the company ""will definitely see a decrease in our U.S.-based real estate portfolio over the ongoing years, particularly as traffic gets more challenged in some of the C(-mall) locations.""American Eagle shares were up 1.7% at 15.22 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.15%.Separately, Lululemon (LULU) CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC following his presentation that the upscale yogawear maker is being targeted in its approach.""When you think about traffic, we're not going after every bit of traffic; we're really focused on getting highly qualified traffic,"" said Potdevin on CNBC. ""If you'd been in our stores during the holiday season, they were really, really busy. And our conversion was outstanding, both in-store and online.""What about Amazon moving in on the apparel space with activewear of its own?""When you have more competitors, you have a bigger market, and it's an opportunity,"" said Potdevin in response. ""I'd rather have more competitors than no competitors. . . It really validates the strength of the market.""Lululemon shares rallied 3% to 70.26 as they work on a cup-with-handle base with a 72.80 buy point.And then there's beauty, which has thus far been a market that's shown relative immunity to Amazon's appetite for brick-and-mortar retailers' business.For e.l.f. beauty (ELF) — which began as an e-commerce business — part of that advantage comes in the form of speed-to-market. It takes the low-cost makeup company as little as 20 weeks to bring a product to market, while larger, slower-moving players can take up to two years to launch product, according to e.l.f. executives at the conference.""We've been able to grow regardless of economic cycle,"" said e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin.E.l.f. is carried in retailers like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS). With only a handful of stand-alone stores, it is expanding its reach via in-store partnerships with existing retail heavyweights.""We see Ulta (ULTA) and Walgreens (WBA) as natural partners and expect a possible announcement in the next 60-90 days,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink following the presentation.""The company's trend identification, development speed, and commitment to newness are both averaging up the gross margin and driving working capital utility, but are also setting the brand apart at retail from a merchandising, messaging, and engagement perspective.""Shares of e.l.f. were down 1.6% at 28.60, near the low of a flat base with a 32.64 entry.

719,L,"The latest poll by USA Today and Suffolk University carried some eye-opening numbers about public disapproval of the media's aggressive attempts to run the country. It found that President Trump has a 47% approval rating and that 44% disapprove of him.That's not surprising. The media talk about his unpopularity all the time.But here's what they don't talk about: their own numbers. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable opinion of their job performance. A whopping 50% have an unfavorable opinion.Look at the numbers by party identification. Republican unfavorable opinion of the media? It's 78%. Only 10% have a favorable opinion. The Democrats are the opposite: Sixty-nine percent hold a favorable view, and 19% hold an unfavorable view.The pollsters offered other media questions, asking: ""President Trump has said journalists and the media are the enemy of the American people. Do you agree or disagree?"" That's an exaggerated question. Trump's actual tweet accused only ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and the ""failing"" New York Times of being ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the American people.""Many conservatives would steer clear of saying that journalists (liberal media and conservative media) are the enemy of the people and stick with chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's take that the media are the ""opposition party"" to Trump. But even so, 64% of Republicans in the poll agreed with Trump, and only 29% disagreed. Democrats sided with their liberal-media buddies, 88% disagreeing and 9% agreeing.These pollsters also asked the public which statement they agreed with, ""President Trump is right when he says the news media is unfair and biased against him"" or ""The news media is right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable.""This result clearly demonstrates how divided the country is on the media under President Trump. Seventy-nine percent of Republicans agree with Trump, and 12% disagree. Democrats align with the media's sudden rush to ""accountability,"" 86% disagreeing and 7% in agreement.Both sides know the media are liberal.These results were submerged in USA Today. The front-page story on the overall poll was headlined ""Temperament and tweets tripping up president."" Reporter Susan Page began saying, ""President Trump gets high marks for leadership amid growing economic optimism, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but questions about his temperament and his tweets have cost him the political boost that a president traditionally gets from that good news.""Page also underlined that his 47% approval rating makes him ""the first president in modern times not to score majority approval at this early point in his tenure."" Fifty-nine percent would like Trump to turn down the tweeting, but even we've made that recommendation.The poll questions about the media finally make a brief appearance 23 paragraphs deep in the story but without the partisan breakdown. Page says: ""Meanwhile, Trump's attacks on reporters divide Americans: 42% say he is right when he says the news media are unfair and biased against him; 48% say the news media are right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable. Are the news media 'the enemy of the American people' as the president has asserted? One-third of Americans, 34%, agree with him. Fifty-nine percent disagree.""The media's rating of 37% favorable and 50% unfavorable was left out.The newspaper industry is declining, as USA Today surely knows: Gannett split into two companies in 2015, one for broadcasting and one for the less profitable print business. It is interesting to watch elite newspapers in the Trump era doubling down on the liberal-activist course. There's a reason half the country no longer cares to read them.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Public Turned Off By Media's Relentlessly Negative Coverage Of TrumpTrump News & Tweets

720,L,"Chipotle Mexico Grill (CMG) warned on fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday, but the burrito chain's stock rose on an improving same-store sales trend.The fast-casual burrito restaurant, in an SEC filing, sees Q4 earnings per share of 50 to 58 cents, well below the 96 cents per share analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect.""During the quarter we incurred higher expenses compared to our originally-forecasted amounts in other operating costs, driven by increased promotional spend and costs related to testing television advertising,"" Chipotle said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.IBD'S TAKE: In an interview with IBD, Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said phone-based ordering will soon look ""quaint"" and he was still assessing what companies like GrubHub and Uber Eats mean for the restaurant industry.Chipotle offered free food and launched a new Chiptopia loyalty program in an effort to win back customers over foodborne illness scares in 2015. While that was a summer program, some of the rewards were redeemed through year-end. Higher avocado costs also weighed on results.Chipotle sees Q4 revenue of $1.035 billion, up from $997.5 million a year earlier but below analyst views for $1.05 billion. It also warned that same-store sales fell 4.8% vs. a year earlier. But comps did improve during the quarter. Down 20.2% in October and 1.4% in November, they jumped 14.7% in December. Increasingly easier comparisons also helped.The company also announced a $100 million stock buyback. That's top of an existing $2.1 billion repurchase program that has $200 million remaining.Chipotle shares climbed nearly 5% to close at 414.48 on the stock market today. Chipotle has moved above its 200-day moving average for the first time since October 2015.The filing comes as the restaurant is slated to present at the ICR Conference 2017 at 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday.Jack in the Box (JACK), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) are among other restaurants presenting at the conference. Jack in the Box and Dave & Buster's have been among the top performers in the struggling restaurant group.Jack in the Box rose 2% to 109.99. Shake Shack fell 0.8% to 35.06, and Dave & Buster's climbed 0.1% to 55.51.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) are two other notable consumer companies speaking at the event.Lululemon advanced 2.5% to 69.90 while e.l.f. slid 0.7% to 28.87.RELATED: Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerChipotle Names Four New Directors In Nod To Investor AckmanMore Holiday Winners, Losers: Maybe Amazon Didn't Ruin Everything?E.l.f.

721,L," Two months ago, the liberal media erupted in horror after the third presidential debate. Fox's Chris Wallace challenged Donald Trump on whether he would accept the result of the election, and Trump said he would wait and see. NBC described a ""flood of condemnation"" and cited President Obama accusing Trump of ""(undermining) our democracy."" ""Today"" co-host Savannah Guthrie called it an ""earthquake.""Guthrie turned to retired anchorman Tom Brokaw to denounce Trump. He said: ""This is not a banana republic. We've got more than 200 years of presidential elections and graceful and peaceful transitions to the new administration. As you saw, even Richard Nixon, Al Gore, the people who were caught up in very close races, said, 'I accept that this is the new president.' ""Trump won the election handily with 304 electoral votes, and Democrats flip-flopped, sullenly refusing to accept the results. And so did the ""objective"" media. On Dec. 18, there was no ""earthquake"" at NBC when Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta refused to say that President-elect Trump won a free and fair election. He said instead that it was rigged by the Russians.And it was the ballot errors. And FBI Director James Comey. And the fake news epidemic. And the Constitution — that  blasted Electoral College! Nobody brought in Brokaw to lecture Team Hillary about banana-republic behavior.Back in October, The New York Times issued a front-page alert, saying, ""In a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month's election if he felt it was rigged against him — a stand that Hillary Clinton blasted as 'horrifying' at their final and caustic debate on Wednesday.""Two months later, the Times was eagerly giving oxygen to any protest against Trump, no matter how fanatical. It said: ""In Florida, protesters swarmed the Capitol rotunda, one hoisting a 'Trump Is Too Rusky' sign featuring a hammer and sickle. In Wisconsin's statehouse, a heckler shouted, ''We're all going to go to war and die thanks to you.'""This was somehow democracy in action. There was no remarkable or horrifying adjective at the top of the story. Instead, the Times turned to Adam Jentleson, a top aide to retiring Sen. Harry Reid, who warned, ""There's not going to be a grace period this time because everybody on our side thinks he's illegitimate and poses a massive threat.""Even the leftist late-night comedians showed the double standard. CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert mocked Trump in October, saying: ""Oh, suspense! Democracy's going to end in a cliffhanger! I guess we're all going to have to wait until Nov. 9 to find out if we still have a country — if Donald Trump is the mood for a peaceful transfer of power or if he's just going to wipe his fat a-- with the Constitution.""After the election, Colbert said: ""Walking around the streets of New York today, a lot of people (were) a little rough. You know, you could see it in their eyes. ... This is what it feels like when America's made great again."" The crowd laughed. He continued: ""And I was really hoping it would feel better because this sucks! And I don't know if you guys had any trouble getting in here tonight because right now, tonight, thousands of people have taken to the streets in protests in cities all over America.""Colbert told his audience to accept President Trump (how noble). But the protesters still drew screams and hearty applause. Somehow they weren't fat dictators using the Constitution as toilet paper.The Times insisted on Monday that ""the uneasiness with Mr. Trump has hardly receded in the nearly six weeks since his election."" That is because the press will not stop agitating, and all the while they call it ""news.""That, folks, is also ""fake news.""

722,L,"JCPenney (JCP) said that same-store sales fell 0.8% in November and December, making it the latest department store giant to put up uninspiring holiday results as malls become increasingly barren and Amazon.com (AMZN)-led e-commerce thrives.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) late Wednesday cut profit forecasts due to tepid holiday sales, with both saying November-December comps slid 2.1%. Macy's also said it planned to slash 10,000 jobs as it closes 68 stores as part of a plan to shut 100 locations over time. The forecasts also came after Macy's in November expressed optimism about the holiday quarter.Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) said this week that it would sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and close 150 Kmart and Sears locations.JCPenney fell 3.7% to 7.57 in the stock market today after tumbling 7.2% on Thursday.The retailer said the first three weeks of November were ""challenging,"" but that comps from the Thanksgiving week through the end of December were positive. Sluggish sales in women's apparel continued to weigh on the chain's results, JCPenney said.The picture was a brighter for appliances, jewelry, outerwear, boots, toys and Sephora beauty products. JCPenney's e-commerce division saw ""double-digit growth,"" the company said, and it held to its EBITDA goal of $1 billion for fiscal 2016.""As we prepare for a new fiscal year, our turnaround in profitability remains on track, and I am pleased that we expect to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating profit,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: As traditional and specialty retailers struggle amid the galactic expansion of Amazon, off-price retailers have done better. Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, was among the few growth stories in retail. As retailers reel, Adobe (ADBE) this week reported that online holiday sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion. Meanwhile, the December jobs report showed that nonstore retailers reported a 5.5% employment gain over the past 12 months. While neither report named Amazon, other surveys suggested that it was grabbing a huge share of overall e-commerce sales.Amazon rose 2%, continuing to advance after clearing its 50-day moving average earlier in the week.Macy's dipped 0.1% Friday after crashing nearly 14% Thursday. Kohl's lost 1.4% following Thursday's 19% plunge. Sears retreated 8% after edging higher Thursday.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersAmazon Effect: As Retail ETFs Struggle, Internet ETF Eyes A BreakoutAfter The Mall Doors Close, Analysts Cut Macy's, Kohl; Chipotle UpgradedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingNordstorm's '1972' Warning Is Another Sign Of Dying MallsKate Spade Stock Jumps On Report It's Considering Sale

724,L,"On Jan. 13, a judge in Houston, Texas, sentenced Alexandria Vera to 10 years in prison. Her crime? The 25-year-old teacher at Stovall Middle School struck up a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student — having sex almost every day, she said, for nine months — but with the parents' approval. She could be eligible for parole in five years.Prosecutors alleged Vera groomed the child and his family, moving the teen and his father into her home and pretending she was dating the father. She also bought groceries for the boy's family and paid the phone bills. She even became pregnant by the boy. When child-protection workers closed in, she got an abortion. Unsurprisingly, the boy is now in foster care.One would assume this story of a sexual predator would be plastered all over the national news. Isn't this the kind of crusading story full of human interest and melodrama? Apparently not. ABC, CBS, and NBC couldn't be bothered. Fox had a segment on ""The Kelly File"" when it broke open last year. CNN's Headline News shows — Drew Pinsky's last year, and Ashleigh Banfield's last week — gave it a single spin.One could guess that reverse sexism plays a role: An adult woman abusing a boy seems more acceptable than a grown man molesting a young girl. One could also guess that adding an abortion to the sinister plot made it less interesting to liberal journalists.These are the same networks that will not stop covering and lecturing about the child sexual abuse — real and alleged and untrue — by Catholic priests, even after the church created new systems to vet not only priests but also even church volunteers who deal with children in parish life.How about newspapers? The New York Times never loses interest in advocating against the Catholic Church on this issue. But on Alexandria Vera in Houston? Nothing. The Washington Post, whose editor Marty Baron was painted as a crusading captain of the church-busting team at The Boston Globe in the Oscar-winning movie ""Spotlight""? It never made the actual paper but drew two blog posts over the last six months that barely surpassed 1,000 words between them.Many people might see this story and recall the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, a 34-year-old teacher who sexually abused an infatuated 12-year-old boy named Vili Fualaau, which became a big tabloid story in 1997.But ultimately, how bothered are some in the liberal community? It's easy to forget that abuse ended up being rewarded. In 2005, after getting out of jail, Letourneau agreed to marry the boy, now an adult. Hollywood then allowed them to cash in.Paramount — the producers of ""Entertainment Tonight"" and ""The Insider"" — announced they had obtained the rights to wallow in the pedophile wedding of the century. What did Paramount do? The two shows spent days panting after the ""lucky couple."" Inside the rehearsal dinner. Inside the wedding. Inside the reception. Paramount interviewers even asked Letourneau for relationship advice!Their rivals at ""Access Hollywood"" played the moralist. Co-host Billy Bush insisted Paramount paid big money for the privilege, ""close to $1 million — a figure they deny,"" Bush said. ""Go to prison; get on TV; get rich,"" he lamented.The disease spread to network TV. In a piece for ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" ""Entertainment Tonight"" reporter Jann Carl hyped the wedding as ""the icing on the cake of a notorious soap opera that still sparks admiration and outrage around the world."" Hold on. Just who ""admires"" the rape of a 12-year-old boy?Child sexual abuse in secular schools doesn't seem to inspire liberal journalists, which underlines that on this absorbing subject, as on many others, what's ""news"" depends on perspective, and in the American media, it is both liberal and libertine.

725,L,"Exchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes closed mostly higher in a choppy session Wednesday. Investors digested mixed news tied to oil and gas stockpiles, as well as tech giant Apple's (AAPL) march nearer to all-time highs.Shares of the iPhone maker added to their sharp rise since a Jan. 31 earnings beat.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.1% on the stock market today after initial softness.Energy led declining S&P sectors in early trade, but oil prices bounced back after official data revealed a surprise drop in gasoline stockpiles to offset a massive rise in U.S. crude stockpiles.Reports of rising U.S. inventories have pummeled oil prices this week, with United States Oil (USO) slicing below its 50-day moving average line. USO finished Wednesday's volatile session with a 0.4% gain.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) reversed from early losses of as much as 1.5% to a 0.2% gain. Peers tracking industry segments, including Alerian MLP (AMLP) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment (XES), also trimmed heavy early losses.The SPDR energy ETF sits 8% below its December high of 78.45, which came amid optimism over an agreement by OPEC and other world producers to cut output.Early on Wednesday, fears that rising U.S. shale output could jeopardize that hard-won deal had weighed on oil prices.Data from the Energy Information Administration released later on Wednesday showed crude inventories rose by 13.8 million barrels in the week through Feb. 3, well above expectations for an increase of 2.5 million barrels.But the official data offered reassuring news on gasoline demand.

726,L,"Michelle Obama made her last public speech as first lady. The networks lined up with a 21-handkerchief salute. Nothing will ever be the same.NBC's Andrea Mitchell proclaimed that the speech was ""one of hope and empowerment for the young people she has championed for eight years ... her unique voice rejecting the racial overtones of 2016."" Obama is a ""once-reluctant political wife, fighting an early caricature as an angry black woman."" Now, Mitchell says, she is ""a political orator in a class of her own."" (How quickly they forget that she proclaimed herself to be proud to be an American only when her husband, who has stoked racial tensions for eight years, started racking up primary victories in 2008.)CBS' Julianna Goldman touted how Obama ""used her celebrity to inspire physical fitness"" and ""turned into the Democrats' not so secret weapon"" in 2016. (Donald Trump won the election. How much of a weapon was she?)But these two networks dug deeper. NBC devoted a whole hour of ""The Tonight Show"" to honoring her. Host Jimmy Fallon oozed: ""Thank you, Mrs. Obama, for being a strong, smart, independent woman; an activist; a style icon; and a great dancer; and showing us all what it would look like if Beyonce married a much nerdier Jay Z."" The next morning, the ""Today"" show aired that clip along with a tweet that proclaimed: ""I'm so speechless. I cried, I laughed, I got chills, and I most definitely grieved. Michelle is truly iconic.""CBS was even worse. It went directly to Oprah Winfrey — who endorsed President Obama in 2008 — for a one-hour prime-time special in December. She uncorked the superlatives, saying, ""Mrs. Obama is not only a woman to watch in American politics but also considered the coolest first lady in U.S. history.""Coolness is measured by ideology, not personality. They consider all Republicans to be doormats, yet they gush over Hillary Clinton, the flattest doormat in recent White House history.The gush continued. Winfrey said: ""With every song, every laugh and daring style choice, the power of Michelle Obama's personality and authenticity has made her a pop culture icon. ... Her fresh approach shined a light on the initiatives she felt most passionate about."" She even cheered ""the Obamas' openly affectionate and romantic marriage"" as being ""a dramatic and welcome change for the first couple living in the White House."" That juxtaposition refers only to the Clintons, and that's something the left will never acknowledge.In case anyone forgot, this is not how the networks treated Laura Bush. After a few polite first lady questions, she would often get George W. Bush-bashing hardballs. In 2005, ABC reporter Jessica Yellin exploited a segment that was supposedly about White House Christmas cards to ask, ""Have you ever met with a mother whose own loss has made you question, even for a moment, whether the U.S. should be in Iraq?""In 2007, while interviewing Laura Bush, ABC's Robin Roberts cited columnist Thomas Friedman as saying ""we should export hope instead of fear."" She added, ""Desmond Tutu went even farther, saying the generosity of Americans — that's what we should export instead of our bombs.""Even after the Bushes left Washington, D.C., it continued. In 2010, NBC's Matt Lauer asked Laura Bush about New Orleans: ""Is it ever painful for you to come back to this region because in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it seems so much of the blame for what happened or didn't happen here was laid at the feet of your husband?""There was no hourlong Winfrey special or Fallon flattery. Laura Bush didn't have a media cult to praise her every ""iconic"" utterance and dance move. That's what Republicans have expected — and quietly tolerated — for decades. But Michelle Obama coverage sounds like what a state-run media in an authoritarian backwater would broadcast about the Great Leader's spouse.

730,L,"After the breakdown of health care reform, both President Trump and the Republican Congress need a W — a win.And not just any win but one that will play into the public demand for faster economic growth, better jobs and higher wages. Recent polls show the nexus of growth, jobs and tax cuts vastly outranks health care.So, most important, middle-class wage earners need a W.We've had job creation, but it hasn't reached all sectors of the population. Consequently, the employment-to-population ratio remains historically low. So does real gross domestic product growth.From 1950 to 2000, growth averaged 3.5% a year. During President Obama's recovery — and, frankly, going back to the year 2000 — growth has hovered at only 2% per year. Real wages have barely improved. New business startups have actually declined. And productivity has flattened.The hole in the center of this tepid growth story is a lack of business investment. It's the missing ingredient. From 1950 to 2000, total business fixed investment averaged a strong 5.3% annual growth. But since 2000, that figure has dropped to only 1.7%.For 50 years, the capital-labor ratio (K/L ratio) increased by an average 3% a year. The capital stock rose 4.3% per year. But since 2009, the K/L ratio has fallen by 0.2% per year, and the capital stock has grown by only 1.5% yearly. This is why productivity and wage gains have been minimal. And the root cause is the lack of business investment.But the GOP can remedy this by providing new tax incentives (including a rollback of costly regulations) right now. Specifically, the new Republican priority should be business tax cuts first.While health care reform simmers on the back burner, the president should go right to business tax reform. It can be nice and simple and easy to understand. There's virtually a bipartisan consensus for it. Separate it out from the broader and far more complex and controversial issues related to individual tax reform.Yes, we desperately need personal-tax simplification. We also need lower tax rates across the board. We need to clamp down on loopholes and unnecessary crony-capitalist deductions to broaden the tax base. But that's a much more difficult and longer battle. Save it for next year.There are hundreds of tax lawyers in Washington, D.C., who can separate out business income from personal income. That will allow legislation to reduce tax rates for the small S-corp companies, as well as limited liability partnerships and proprietorships.So let's end the war on business. Let's reward success, rather than punish it. Congress need only go for a 10% repatriation rate, a 15 to 20% tax rate for large and small businesses, and immediate expensing for new investments.And perhaps to draw in some Democrats, legislators can use part of the roughly $200 billion in repatriation revenues to provide an equity base for an infrastructure fund that is privately owned and run. No new Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. No government directors. Keep it all in the private sector.And forget the crazy border-adjustment tax, or BAT. It would badly damage consumers and the economy, when what we need is faster growth.Meanwhile, don't obsess over various reconciliation rules. Reconciliation can be whatever you want it to be. The so-called Byrd Rule, which stipulates deficit neutrality over the long run, has been broken many times over the past 30 years.And maybe this time the GOP will talk to the Senate parliamentarian. Or perhaps the president of the Senate — Vice President Pence can overrule the parliamentarian.With lower business tax rates and more net business investment to grow the capital stock, the economy is capable of growing over 3% yearly. And that 1 percentage point increase from the 2% baseline would yield, according to the Congressional Budget Office, more than $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years.The misbegotten BAT, and its phony $1 trillion pay-for, can be buried in a deep gravesite inside a large crypt.Perhaps the major selling point for business tax cuts is the fact that the biggest beneficiaries are middle-income wage earners, not so-called rich people and rich corporations.Importantly, the best research on this has been done by Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute and in recent years supported by a number of papers. Ironically, Hassett is slated to be chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisors, as soon as his vetting process is complete. No one makes the case better than Hassett that business tax cuts are a middle-class tax cut.So, with the postponement of health care reform, we now have more than four months before the August recess to give the country the fuel injection it needs: a boost for wage earners, businesses and consumers, productivity and better jobs.Put business tax cuts first. Right now.RELATED:How Trump Can Win On TaxesTrump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get OneTrump's Job One: Cut Taxes To Restore Booming Economic Growth

732,L,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

734,L,"As Super Bowl LI takes its place in the history books — climaxing with a 34-28 victory by the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots over the feisty Atlanta Falcons, settled abruptly in overtime as the Patriots notched the biggest come-from-behind rally in the NFL championship game's annals — the Patriots and the Falcons probably were not the only teams you had a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you likely had a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza.More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that ran television ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which was expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well, and game-related ads in additional media.Advertisers ranged from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler (DDAIF), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com (WIX).IBD'S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving.InBev shares were down 16% over the past 12 months, going into Friday. But Daimler was up 8% in that period. And Wix shares had soared 159%.Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game included $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America (AIVSX), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX).Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX).Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that advertised on TV during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria's Secret (LB) and Wix.com.Intel shares are up 23% over the past 12 months. The stock has a decent 82 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.PepsiCo shares are up 6% in the past year. Performing dismally, L Brands stock is down 38% in the past year.Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares.Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform.Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria's Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler's ADRs.Additional publicly traded TV advertisers during the game included Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY)-owned Audi and Kia.RELATED:Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

735,L,"Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are soaring Thursday on positive same-store sales results for the month of January, making it a standout amid lukewarm comps from other retailers.Shares soared 3.9% to 168.15 in heavy volume in the stock market today, clearing a 165.05 entry point from a cup-with-handle base.Excluding the impact of currency and gas price changes, Costco logged 5% in comp gains, the membership warehouse chain said late Wednesday. That marks the largest monthly comparable sales increase since August 2014, according to research firm Retail Metrics. Including those factors, total company comps rose 7%.Core U.S. comps grew 5%, above the firm's expectations. Hard-line items such as tires, sporting goods and hardware performed well, but so did soft-line items such as small appliances and home furnishings, according to a Retail Metrics report.Other retailers did not fare as well during the first month of 2017. L Brands (LB) reported a 4% comp decline, as its exit from swimwear and apparel weighed on sales at Victoria's Secret. Included in that total figure are a 10% comp drop at Victoria's Secret but a 12% same-store sales gain at Bath & Body Works.According to Retail Metrics, that marked the company's worst monthly comp report since November 2013.For all of Q4, ended in late January, total comps for L Brands were flat, with strength at Bath & Body Works offsetting weakness at Victoria's Secret.Shares of L Brands initially fell but rallied for a 0.8% gain.Meanwhile, among teen retailers, Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps rose 9.4%, while Buckle (BKE) comps sank 17.6% for the month. Zumiez shares rose 4.9%, while Buckle slid 0.2%.RELATED:Macy's Biggest Sale Yet: Itself? Maybe, Says The New York Post

736,L,"As President Barack Obama's White House days run out, it's time for his obsequious courtiers in the liberal media to announce his glorious ""legacy."" On Dec. 7, CNN devoted a two-hour prime-time special to the Obama legacy. It was hosted by Fareed Zakaria, a journalist whom Obama had invited to the White House so he could soak in Zakaria's wisdom and expertise — in other words, so he could flatter a journalist into giving him softball coverage.Mission accomplished.Just as it began nine years ago, Zakaria started by celebrating the president's race, the gauzy references to Kenya and Kansas fusing into one glorious body. Forget what Obama did. The first legacy was simply who he represented.And for that he'd been victimized. In CNN's eyes, Obama's central crisis was the ""fierce, unrelenting opposition"" of Republicans and their latent racism. Obama's former senior advisor David Axelrod claimed, ""It's indisputable that there was a ferocity to the opposition and a lack of respect to him that was a function of race."" CNN pundit Van Jones agreed, saying, ""I can't name one thing that this Congress supported this president on in eight years!"" The left never had the intellectual nuance (or the political decency) to acknowledge that one could oppose Obama because he's a socialist. Period.At the show's end, Zakaria concluded: ""Presidential legacies also exist above and beyond laws and policies. We remember John F. Kennedy for energy, vitality, elegance and intelligence that he brought to the White House. And in that sense, Obama has left an indelible mark.""He and his family occupied the White House with dignity, grace and good humor. He ran an administration that was largely scandal-free ... and did it all the while under a microscope because he looked different.""At a time when liberals are warning about the democracy-gutting potential of fake news, there is no faker news than the declaration that Obama's time in office was largely scandal-free. In the two-hour special there was no mention of Benghazi or IRS harassment, and no time given to Solyndra or Operation Fast and Furious. Some scandals — the failure of ObamaCare, the courting of Islamist Iran — were cast as ""signature (achievements).""How this network still includes the word ""news"" in the title is beyond us.Most spectacularly, Zakaria didn't utter one word about the national debt. It almost doubled from $10 trillion to an inconceivable $19 trillion in just eight years. Obama fans complain that it's not all Obama's fault, but CNN and Zakaria didn't think that's a legacy, or at least as much of a legacy as, say, Obama holding a ""beer summit"" with Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates.The dourest note that Zakaria hit in the two hours was — you guessed it — that troublesome President-elect Donald Trump. He may erase much of what Obama thinks is his enormous legacy. Zakaria admitted that ObamaCare has problems, but so what? He is so pro-Obama that it doesn't matter whether it's actually a complete failure. He said: ""I would argue that even if Donald Trump finds a way to repeal and replace it, it remains a historic achievement. Barack Obama did what seven presidents failed to do — he made health care a fundamental right. It's the signature achievement of a consequential president.""This is socialist logic. Enshrining a right to health care never guarantees comprehensive health care. Ask the people of Fidel Castro's Cuba. Hillary Clinton lost in part because working-class people couldn't afford — and didn't want — ObamaCare. That is his legacy, too.Conservatives will define Trump's success by measuring how many of Obama's failed policies are reversed, and whether untrammeled federal government overreach is slowed in any way. We can count on CNN to oppose that agenda every step of the way. RELATED:Trump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's WhyMedia Malpractice? Media Bias And The 2016 ElectionGot Fake News?

738,L,"Critics of the Hollywood left chuckled when Hillary Clinton lost the election. Those dramatic videos full of celebrity ardor for the Clintons flopped. Rarely has there been a more pronounced disconnect. It turned to belly laughs when those celebrities responded by making more videos.First, the celebrity leftists made a video urging the Electoral College to actually reject the election results. When it dawned on them (Has it dawned on them?) that America wasn't going to reverse itself because they said so, they gave that up.Now they want to derail President-elect Donald Trump's administration, so out came a celebrity video promoting MoveOn that was full of pompous celebs urging Congress to reject Trump's Cabinet nominees. They announced: ""The majority of Americans, regardless of who they voted for, did not vote for racism, for sexism or for xenophobia. And yet Donald Trump won."" Only in La-La Land does that incoherence make sense.But the ad that takes the celebrity cake appeared in the Jan. 11 edition of the Washington Post. Page A-5 carried a full-page advertisement. Written large on the top half were the words: ""No! In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept a fascist America!""We think they're upset.""The presidency of Donald Trump is illegitimate,"" reads a bold-lettered subheading. The ad continues: ""By any definition, Donald Trump is a fascist. He has put together a regime who will carry out this program, and worse.""It even dispenses with the actual voters, saying: ""No election, whether fair or fraudulent, should legitimize this. 'Reaching across the aisle' only legitimizes that which is illegitimate."" How ironic that this diatribe ran on the very same day that the Post hailed President Obama's farewell address for identifying ""gathering threats to American democracy.""Their pompous call to action reads like the anti-Declaration of Independence. ""We, the undersigned, know in the depths of our beings, the catastrophe that will befall the people of the world should the Trump/Pence regime assume full power,"" it says. They insist the election should be thrown out because the Electoral College is ""an institution set up in 1787 to protect slavery.""The actors who signed this appeal for a coup included Ed Asner, Margaret Cho, Debra Messing, Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Shannon and David Strathairn.Shannon plays villains in the movies ... and in real life. He said: ""There's a lot of old people who need to realize they've had a nice life, and it's time for them to move on. ... If you look at the young people, between 18 and 25, if it was up to them Hillary would have been president. No offense to the seniors out there. My mom's a senior citizen. But if you're voting for Trump, it's time for the urn."" Entertainment Weekly praised him as ""a patron saint of grumpiness and grief.""There were plenty more celebrity activists on this list. There were the Hollywood directors Joe Dante and John Landis. There were the far-left rebels of the music world, rappers Chuck D and Vic Mensa; and jazz musicians Kurt Elling, Lalah Hathaway and Arturo O'Farrill. And there were alternative rockers Alex Ebert of the band ""Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes,"" Merrill Garbus of ""tUnE-yArDs"" and Thurston Moore of ""Sonic Youth.""The signatories also include leaders of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, which is committed to a global revolution. (So much for opposing Trump's pending dictatorship.) This party's constitution rejects democracy. It says, ""In a world marked by profound class divisions and social inequality, to talk about 'democracy' — without talking about the class nature of that democracy and which class it serves — is meaningless, and worse.""Based on the copy of this ad, it's fair to surmise the signatories feel very much at home with that sentiment.The Hollywood left is too enriched to be communist. ""Pampered multimillionaires of Hollywood, unite!"" It has a certain ring.

741,L,"U.S. equities shaved off some of Monday morning's steep losses, yet the broad decline remained largely intact with one hour left in the trading session.Higher volume on both exchanges vs. the same time on Friday indicated some intense profit-taking by large money managers. Oil and gas, wood products, fiber optic tech, and internet content firms led the market's downside.Given the sell-off, IBD investors need to pay close attention to the degree of pullback by their stocks that have broken out of well-formed bases or rallied off a key support level, including the 10-week moving average. And a few in techland appear to be doing just fine.They include megacap consumer tech play Apple (AAPL), sinking just 0.6% to 121.23, still above a cup-with-handle breakout at 118.12; Applied Materials (AMAT), an emerging play for actuator chips, down 2.1%; and fellow chip-equipment firm KLA-Tencor (KLAC), off only 0.3% to 85.88 and holding above an 83.33 flat-base entry.Actuators convert digital signals into physical motion, light or sound and pose as the next step in the Internet of Things megatrend. Applied Materials, down nearly 2% to 34.31, is still more than 10% past a recent flat-base breakout at 31.17; and its RS line continues to rise.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is one several blue-chip stocks that have broken out in recent weeks. Apple is one of six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continues to hint that it's not ready to succumb to a big sell-off, even after rallying more than 260% from a March 2016 breakout past an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16 and flashing climax-run-like action at the end of December. Shares in the leading graphics processors firm edged 1.6% lower following a sharp rebound over the prior nine trading sessions.Watch to see if Nvidia has the strength to form a new cup-type base, which must be a minimum six weeks in length.The Nasdaq composite, falling as much as 1.4% early, was off nearly 1% as of 3 p.m. New York time. The Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.9%.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%; both key indexes also were rebounding from midmorning lows, while the Russell 2000 suffered the worst slide, down around 1.2%. The small-cap gauge, as well as the S&P SmallCap 600, are now both down for the year after leading the major indexes with stout rallies in 2016.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker is set to report December quarter-ending fiscal Q1 results after the close on Tuesday. One big question: Will the Silicon Valley titan finally snap its three-quarter string of shrinking earnings per share?Overall, though, the action in Apple has been steady since the stock climbed out of its long bottoming base pattern with a Sept. 14 breakout past 110.33. Back then, it formed a nice cup with handle that lasted roughly five months. The decline from head to toe in that cup was a little more than 20%. But in the latest cup-with-handle pattern, which began with a stalling day-like session on Oct. 11, Apple corrected merely 12% from high to low within the base.What does that mean? It may indicate that institutions have become more comfortable with holding their shares or even adding to positions.Both today and in the next few days, keep a close eye on those stocks that bounce hard off this week's intraday lows, as well as those highly rated companies that actually make the positive side of IBD's long-running ""Stocks On The Move"" table, part of IBD's proprietary list of screens to help you find the greatest stock market winners.Often, the biggest growth plays will show up repeatedly on Stocks On The Move as they bottom out after a sharp correction, shape the right side of symmetrical-looking base patterns, and break out amid a confirmed uptrend.No doubt, a few stock in energy, telecom and manufacturing sectors are performing poorly after attempting breakouts. They included international oil and gas explorer Hess (HES) (rising just 3% past a 63.86 pivot point); July 2016 IPO Impinj (PI) (breakout past 37.80 flawed cup with handle lasts just five days, now in new basing formation); and Verizon (VZ) (fails to complete a new base after the June 2016 breakout past 54.59 sees limited daylight).The point: Not all breakouts succeed. So one must always have the psychological strength to cut losses short, at a maximum of 7% to 8% but preferably less, at 4% to 5% from the purchase price.Meanwhile, fear is up sharply in the stock market today, at least among options traders; keep an eye on CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, which tracks the volatility premiums on S&P 100 index options. As noted multiple times in the IBD daily Big Picture premium feature, the VIX had reached levels where it would not be a surprise to see stocks taking at least a short break.RELATED:Dow Loses 20,000 As VIX Fear Gauge Spikes From Excessive LowsHow To Trade Stocks: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters TodayHow To Trade Stocks II: How Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009How To Trade Stocks III: Which IBD 50 Firms May Have The Rosiest Sales Growth In 2017?The Best Stock Brokers: Trading Wisdom From the Former Chairman Of E.F.

742,L,"For weeks, the liberal media have celebrated all that President Barack Obama means ... to them. CNN produced a two-hour documentary on the Obama legacy that never mentioned things like annual trillion-dollar deficits. Fareed Zakaria wrapped up the show saying, ""He ran an administration that was largely scandal-free and did it all the while under a microscope because he looked different.""This kind of fake news will continue through Obama's farewell address and President-elect Trump's inauguration.But let's dig in to media history to recall how differently the media treated President Ronald Reagan as he delivered his farewell address to the American people in 1989. The night before the speech, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl spoke for the media elites on NBC's ""Later"" with Bob Costas. ""I predict historians are going to be totally baffled by how the American people fell in love with this man and followed him the way we did,"" she said.That was a confession. No matter how diligently Stahl and her liberal colleagues had tried, their attacks on Reagan could not weaken his hold on the public.Just moments after the speech, ABC brought in Sam Donaldson to kvetch. He said: ""It was a very self-congratulatory speech. The president talked about his accomplishments in very glowing terms. He talked about the deficit once. But he didn't mention a lot of things that historians will look and say 'No, it didn't happen just that way, and it didn't turn out that well.'""It was common to bring up what Reagan wouldn't mention. The morning after the speech, ABC anchor Lark McCarthy announced: ""The speech did not mention the Iran-Contra scandal, the hostages or Panama. And there was no mention of ethics or the continuing nightmare of terrorism."" Correspondent Jeanne Meserve did the same, saying, ""The president barely mentioned the federal deficit and didn't talk at all about some of the other failures of his presidency: Central American policy, the Iran-Contra affair and the American hostages in Lebanon.""On ""CBS This Morning"" that day, co-host Harry Smith pressed Reagan's daughter Maureen Reagan about poverty: ""He talked about being proud of what's happened with the economy, about the millions of new jobs that have been created. And as I listened to that, I also thought one out of five babies born in the United States are born into poverty. There are hundreds of thousands of people in this country now that are homeless, have no place to live. I wonder, how does your father reconcile that in his mind? How does he reconcile those two things?""That evening, CBS reporter Richard Threlkeld gave Reagan credit for one achievement: ""peace abroad."" As for the recovery, he argued, ""Things are not nearly as prosperous as the president makes them sound,"" ludicrously claiming that Jimmy Carter was a better president. ""On average, more new jobs were created every year under Jimmy Carter than Ronald Reagan,"" he said.Appearing on the CBS late-night news show ""Nightwatch"" with Charlie Rose that same evening, Laurence Barrett of Time magazine noted that Reagan didn't say much about then-president-elect George H.W. Bush: ""That would have prompted all of us to say, 'Hey, why didn't he mention the horrendous problems he's leaving George Bush?' Reagan pumped a lot of electricity into the American system when it needed it. He's leaving it to George to pay the electricity bill."" Barrett slammed Reagan as ""the perpetrator of the great free-lunch illusion: that we could have all of these goodies and not pay the bill.""That was then. This is now. Joe Klein of Time magazine summarized Obama's tenure by saying: ""There would be little melodrama and absolutely no hint of scandal during his time in office. The conservative fever swamps would be no less pustulent than they were during the Clinton presidency — indeed, the level of race-based hatemongering was frightening — but somehow the Obamas never let it get to them.""

750,L,"The holiday retail numbers are rolling in, and they do not look good. Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) shares were set aflame late Wednesday (and continue to burn Thursday) on same-store sales declines and slashed earnings targets.The dismal department store results have also singed Michael Kors (KORS), Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE) and Fossil (FOSL). The accessories brands are feeling the heat following Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren's comment that handbags and watches performed poorly over the major selling period.""Accessories was the single consistent 'negative' at both"" retailers, wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy. ""This leads us to believe the (North American) handbag category is tracking for another flat to down quarter, which likely impacts KORS.""Some specialty retailers are logging worse-than-expected holiday sales results. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) said comparable sales declined 1% for the five weeks ended Dec. 31, and now projects fourth-quarter per-share profit toward the lower end of guidance for $1.85-$2, below consensus views for $1.98.The decline surprised Street analysts who had been expecting a comp increase of 1.5%.Shares of Macy's collapsed 14% on the stock market today, and Kohl's plunged 19%. L Brands sank 7.9%, Fossil tumbled 7.6% and Michael Kors fell 3.2%. Coach dropped 2.6% but Kate Spade, which could put itself up for sale, rallied to close up 0.7%. lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: This year will be one of ""reckoning"" and ""awakening,"" said NPD Group's Marshal Cohen, as retailers grapple with modern consumption habits.But it's not all coal in Christmas stockings, at least in the e-commerce realm. Adobe (ADBE) said the November and December holiday season brought in an 11% year-over-year online sales rise to $91.7 billion, a little more than a tenth percent above predictions for $91.6 billion.And among individual retailers, Costco (COST) logged a 3% comp gain for December, which Retail Metrics said is the warehouse retailer's greatest monthly comp gain in two years.Shares of Costco were up 2% Thursday.Children's Place (PLCE) ""was one the few bright spots in retail so far reporting a solid 6.9% holiday same-store sales gain for the November-December period,"" said the research firm's president Ken Perkins in a report.Comparable retail sales rose 6.9% in the first nine weeks of Q4, prompting the company to raise Q4 and full-year earnings guidance.Children's Place shares fell intraday to 100.35 but closed up 0.1% at 104.20.

751,L,"The secular-left website Slate recently warned on Twitter that ""'Religious Freedom' legislation will be everywhere in 2017."" ""Religious freedom"" is in scare quotes, a warning that deplorables will use that thing called religion as their weapon of choice in the coming assault on the LGBTQ community.The same website is celebrating a petition urging the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to reverse its acceptance of an invitation to sing at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. The freedom to disassociate becomes a terrific idea when used to reject Republicans or conservatives. Slate's story has a hero named Jan Chamberlin, who quit the famous choir because it will appear to be ""endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man."" She says, ""I only know I could never 'throw roses to Hitler.'""Slate ""reported,"" ""Trump is not just any president-elect for Mormons, many of whom were turned off by his vulgarity, repressive immigration proposals, and calls for religious persecution."" Like many leftists, the only religious people it cares about being persecuted are Muslims. Persecuting Christians — and we mean real persecution, as in setting bodies on fire, chopping off heads, machine-gunning and the like — means literally nothing to websites like Slate. It has mocked a ""Christian persecution complex"" among conservatives.Another Trump inauguration issue further displayed leftist hypocrisy: the scheduled performance of the Radio City Rockettes. One of the dancers, Phoebe Pearl, protested on her Instagram page: ""The women I work with are intelligent and are full of love and the decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we're against is appalling. I am speaking for just myself but please know that after we found out this news, we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts. We will not be forced! #notmypresident.""Basement-dwelling outlets like MTV News characterized this controversy as ""a brief, Hunger Games-esque preview of the horrors to come."" Facing angry liberal-media coverage, Rockettes Chairman James Dolan said that no dancer would be forced to perform. What do you suppose would be their reaction if a Rockette were to announce that she would not rent her apartment to a lesbian because she finds the lesbian lifestyle appalling?The secular left never recognized this line of reasoning when conservative Christians wanted to bow out of events they disagree with — gay weddings. Florists like Barronelle Stutzman, bakers like Aaron and Melissa Klein, and farm owners like Robert and Cynthia Gifford have been trashed by the left and heavily fined by liberal bureaucrats for wanting to make their own choices.So let's just make it apples to apples here. How would the media have reacted if members of one of these groups had refused to perform at Obama's inauguration? Undeniably, they would've been slammed as racists for shunning the first black president. But go against Trump and you're heroic, the resistance to the American Hitler.It's time for the ""progressives"" to recognize their own hypocrisy. No one should be forced to participate in an event they find to be immoral, whether it's the Pledge of Allegiance or a gay wedding. They mock the idea of tolerating intolerance under Trump and then embody all the tortured logic it implies. Their zone of freedom of association is exactly as broad as their narrow leftist orthodoxy.

753,L,"A lukewarm shopping environment hasn't put a blemish on the beauty industry, which has been the fastest-growing retail segment for the last three years, according to NPD Group.Specialty players Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH-owned Sephora are flourishing — and value cosmetics brand and recent issue e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) appears poised to take advantage of the on-fire trend.E.l.f., which sells its wares mostly via CVS (CVS), Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty and other national retailers, went public at 17 in late September, rising roughly 70% to about 29 a share as of Wednesday.In an email Q&A with Investor's Business Daily, e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin outlined his approach to engagement, the significance of its small but growing brick-and-mortar presence, and the company's greatest growth opportunities in 2017.IBD: Social media — Instagram in particular — has become a hot spot for beauty enthusiasts. Following e.l.f.'s Beauty Scape activation, how does social media play into your engagement strategy in 2017, and how do you see that impacting the new loyalty program?Amin: Our approach to engage consumers is deeply rooted in social media and digital platforms, and will continue to be a main pillar of our engagement strategy. We were extremely pleased with the outcome of our e.l.f. Beauty Scape activation, which delivered a 25% increase in Instagram followers and reached a combined community of 53 million across social media platforms. We believe we can further build awareness and deepen engagement with our consumers in different ways, including our new Beauty Squad loyalty program. We enrolled 80,000 consumers in just the first six weeks and look forward to continuing to expand the program as we strengthen our CRM capabilities and deliver more fun, relevant content for our consumers.IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""IBD: You've previously said that the majority of growth will be driven by your presence in retailers such as Target and CVS? How do you see the sales mix of e.l.f. direct-channel, third-party e-commerce (such as Amazon) and national retailers shifting over the next few years, if at all?Amin: We expect the U.S. to be the largest source of our growth over the next few years as we grow space allocation with existing retailers, increase new customers and grow our direct-to-consumer business through elfcosmetics.com and e.l.f. stores. The majority of our growth will be driven by national retailers, given the white space that we see here in existing doors as well as new doors. That being said, our direct channel plays an incredibly important role in terms of validating our innovation and engaging with our consumers, and we believe there is significant room to grow here as well.IBD: There are fewer than 20 stand-alone e.l.f. brick-and-mortar retail locations. What's the significance of building out a brick-and-mortar presence?Amin: In Q3 of 2016, we opened seven e.l.f. stores, to bring our total to 15, including our first California stores, with two locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Our stores showcase a broad assortment of e.l.f. products, create an environment dedicated to play beautifully, and allow us to test and validate new products. We believe our stores provide a great opportunity for us to connect with our consumers in an experiential format, and drive both awareness and engagement.IBD: Cosmetic and skin care products are still selling well, even as other areas of retail have struggled. Do you see interest in beauty peaking any time soon?Amin: We believe that the cosmetics category is highly attractive given its scale, growth dynamics and consumer demand trends. And, given the importance of cosmetics in a woman's daily regimen and the availability of products across price points, the category has demonstrated resiliency through economic cycles. We expect cosmetics to continue to be among the fastest growing and most consistent consumer categories.IBD: What's the biggest area of growth and opportunity for e.l.f. in 2017?Amin: We believe we are in the early innings of growth as we continue to make progress on our four key strategies: Build a great brand, lead innovation, expand brand penetration and drive world-class operations. We continue to see momentum in both our direct channels and leading national retailers, as well as strong operational results and remain excited about our business as we head into 2017.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

755,L,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

756,L,"At the dawn of 2017, let us offer a philosophical question for the news media. If the scourge of the new year is ""fake news,"" should we not concede that it's not news to speculate about what will happen after a news event? The problem is, without speculation about the future — whether immediate or distant — cable news channels and radio news outlets would surely enter a crisis about how to fill 24 hours a day, and newspapers would struggle to fill their pages.Time magazine offered a double issue called ""The Year Ahead."" Obviously, it cannot be defined as news. Nothing has happened yet. The final page of content in the edition is ""The 2017 Quiz on News-to-Be."" The concept is clearly borrowed from the late New York Times columnist William Safire, who began many years with a similar crystal ball quiz.Questions can project the news outlet's obsessions, and these certainly do. The second quiz question is, ""When it comes to conflicts of interest, Donald Trump will make no changes to his business practices because?"" Options include ""His lawyers say the law doesn't require him to"" and ""Americans don't really care.""How Trump handles the potentially massive conflict of interest that is his global business empire should be a top news story. He'll soon announce how he prefers to resolve that matter. Is it utterly impossible to suggest he will make changes to his business practices? We can predict he will and that whatever he does won't satisfy Time magazine. Also, after summarily ignoring both Clintons' buckraking practices for years, why the sudden concern for financial ethics? Ah, the ""news"" business.The third quiz question inquired, ""Rex Tillerson's nomination as Secretary of State will?"" The choices include ""Slip by,"" ""Fail,"" ""Be eclipsed by the hearings for Energy Secretary designate Rick Perry"" and ""Drag on for weeks because of the constant interruptions by climate-change protesters dressed as sick polar bears."" Our option — ""be a panicked effort by the left to create controversy, which will fizzle"" — didn't make the cut.Democrats only come up within the milquetoast question ""In 2017, the most interesting political figure not named Trump will be?"" The choices (in order) are Gov. Jerry Brown, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Chuck Schumer and — at the bottom — President-elect Trump's advisor Kellyanne Conway.Time magazine itself knows these predictions are barely worth the glossy paper on which they're printed. On the page before the quiz, Time humorist Joel Stein acknowledged that ""2016 was a horrible year for predictions,"" as the liberals and their pollsters predicted the Brexit vote and the Trump vote would never go wrong for them. These are the media organizations that assumed it was ridiculous for liberal analyst Nate Silver to project in the final hours that Trump had a 29% chance of winning.This will not stop liberals from projecting their worst nightmares and using ""news"" outlets as their megaphones. Before the election, CNN analyst Carl Bernstein insisted Trump was a ""neo-fascist sociopath"" setting up a ""neo-fascist movement."" On MSNBC, Rachel Maddow announced: ""I've been reading a lot about what it was like when Hitler first became chancellor. ... I think that's possibly where we are.""President Trump could be a disaster. President Trump could be wildly successful. The Republican Congress could pass some impressive conservative reforms. Or we could get more big-government disappointment. But all kinds of pundits should have the humility to recognize that none of our psychic instincts qualify as news.We now return you to that argument about ""fake news.""

758,L,"White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders exposed a notable bit of hypocrisy on ABC's ""This Week."" As the liberal media boiled over President Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping him, ABC host Martha Raddatz spat at Sanders about a conservative blog's reporting, saying: ""And Heat Street, they have two sources with links to the counterintelligence community. That's it. Anonymous sources.""Sanders shot back: ""I love how anonymous sources don't count when it's something that's positive in this administration and against the former one. You guys use anonymous sources every single day. ... But now that there are new anonymous sources, it doesn't matter.""Bravo! We couldn't have said it better ourselves. We don't see evidence yet that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump or his aides, but we know this: Arrogant Old Media outlets think their sources are automatically impeccable, eternally credible and nonpartisan. Indeed, Raddatz bit down on that notion, replying to Sanders: ""Yes, we do. ... The Washington Post says this morning that 'senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the wide-ranging federal investigation into Russian interference into the election said there had been no wiretap.'""So why are we all supposed to genuflect to the Washington Post and The New York Times when they publish breathless stories taking on the White House relying on their favored ""senior U.S. officials""? After all, in August, the Times put a columnist on its front page declaring that the press needed to be ""oppositional"" and defeat Trump since he is a ""demagogue playing to the nation's worst racist and nationalistic tendencies"" who ""cozies up to anti-American dictators and ... would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes.""The Post imagines itself as forever taking down the latest Nixons. One anti-Trump column was headlined ""In the angry face of Trumpism, media must speak truth to glower.""It's beyond ironic that the press that champions transparency also advocates relying on completely opaque sources on a daily basis. In political combat over allegations that the Obama administration holdovers in the intelligence community tried to take down Trump, wouldn't it help to know whether these liberal newspapers are relying on the holdovers and granting them all the benefits of anonymity? Isn't it possible that ""senior officials"" are offering talking points authored by Barack Obama himself? We'll never know. But we know we can't trust liberal newspapers given their political tilt.The Post openly knocked Trump for decrying anonymous sources even as his own officials demanded anonymity. ""Two of those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity — a practice President Trump has condemned,"" wrote Greg Miller and Adam Entous. But they don't note their own daily hypocrisy.These media outlets can even fail to disclose biographical facts when an official is named. The Post ran an Op-Ed (and a three-minute video, or negative ad) by Edward Price headlined ""I didn't think I'd ever leave the CIA. But because of Trump, I quit."" Price presented himself as an intelligence pro who worked for administrations of both parties, saying, ""To be clear, my decision had nothing to do with politics, and I would have been proud to again work under a Republican administration open to intelligence analysis.""But he was quickly exposed. He's registered to vote in Washington, D.C., as a Democrat, and last August, he gave a total of $5,000 in donations to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. The Post added a line to Price's column online saying that the donations should have been disclosed.But we never know the donation records of ""senior U.S. officials"" placed anonymously on the front page, do we? The liberal media merely insists, ""Trust us.""RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

That's in line with expectations and up slightly from a revised 5% in September.Home prices rose 0.6%, seasonally adjusted, vs. the prior month, slightly above forecasts.A nationwide index rose 5.6% vs. a year earlier, best gain in two years and up from 5.4% in September. At 185.06, the index exceeded its 2006 peak for the first time.Seattle led with a 10.7% year-over-year price gain, followed by Portland with 10.3% and Denver at 8.3%. New York had the smallest annual gain, at 1.7%.The Case-Shiller tracks existing home prices and are based on single-family home resales.

""However, mortgage interest rates rose in November and are expected to rise further as home prices continue to outpace gains in wages and personal income.""Blitzer added: ""Affordability trends do not suggest an immediate reversal in home price trends. Nevertheless, home prices cannot rise faster than incomes and inflation indefinitely.""New- and existing-home sales continued to climb in November, but that may reflect buyers rushing to close deals before mortgage rates rise further.Shares of homebuilders, including D.R.

763,L,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg is under enormous pressure from the left to crack down on the ""fake news"" circulating on the social-media giant. He is well-advised to run as far as he can from the News Police.In a recent note on Facebook, Zuckerberg claimed he wanted to err ""on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. ... We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties."" The hard left, beginning with President Obama, wants to be that community, that supposedly disinterested third party. It is another step in the long march toward silencing conservative thought in America.Make no mistake about it: Fake news does exist. Everyone is used to false click-bait, like the recent ""Megyn Kelly leaving Fox?"" story floating around the internet, which claims she's leaving to promote some blah-blah-blah skin care product. Then there are the offshore fake news factories churning out ""shocking"" reports about Pope Francis backing Donald Trump.Are these annoyances? Yes. Are they threats to Western civilization? Hardly.The left saw an opening with talk of fake news and pounced. On the campaign trail, Obama said: ""If they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense."" It was an obvious slam of the Trump team.If what Trump states is false, then to give it endless oxygen by writing story after story on it is to engage in fake news.Fox News is mocked as Faux News by this camp. Obama told Rolling Stone that part of the problem is seeing ""Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country,"" which is as inappropriate a complaint as it was exaggerated. He doubled down and praised the hippie hoaxmeisters of campus rape, saying: ""Good journalism continues to this day. There's great work done in Rolling Stone.""Are the red flags for fake news only going to target stories that upset liberals? The leftist group Media Matters for America is claiming it will de-emphasize its Fox News obsession to focus instead on websites like Breitbart and the ""alt-right"" platforms in an effort to be that ""trusted third party"" to help run Facebook's algorithms.Do you think they would ever call out leftist fake news outlets like, oh, themselves?The networks have labored mightily to avoid videotapes demonstrating Planned Parenthood allegedly sold dead baby parts to fetal-tissue researchers. The left said those taped admissions are somehow faked, even after all the footage, which shows no such thing, was made available. Then there's hidden camera footage of Democratic operatives who discussed sending thugs in ""Trump is a Nazi"" T-shirts to agitate Trump supporters and ""draw them out to punch (them)"" in front of the cameras. Clearly that is fake news. Where are Obama and Media Matters when we need them?If messing up and publishing or broadcasting false news ruins an entire outlet as fake news, then goodbye, mainstream media. ABC faked the sales of rancid meat at Food Lion. CBS offered unverified Texas Air National Guard memos against former President George W. Bush. NBC faked a pickup truck explosion. The Washington Post had Janet Cooke. The New York Times had Jayson Blair. CNN had Peter Arnett ... and Brian Williams, Brian Williams and Brian Williams.Mark Zuckerberg really doesn't want to mess with this mess. It is censorship at its ugliest.

764,L,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

765,L,"November new-home sales rose 5.2% to an annual rate of 592,000 in November, the Commerce Department said Friday, the second-best pace of the housing recovery next to July's 622,000.Economists had expected a more-modest gain to an annualized 580,000.The overall figure is the hardest evidence that housing demand has remained strong even as mortgage rates soar to two-year highs.Existing-home sales rose to their best levels since 2007, the National Association of Realtors said, but those reflect contract signings several weeks earlier, when borrowing costs were not as high. New-home sales are more timely.Mortgage applications for buying a home actually rose significantly after the presidential election, which sent mortgage yields flying.With job growth steady and wage growth generally trending higher, housing demand should stay solid. But some of November's gain in home sales and mortgage applications may reflect Americans rushing to buy a house before rates rise even further.Sales in the Midwest skyrocketed 43.8%, while sales in the West rose 7.7% to their best pace since January 2008. New-home sales fell in the South for a fourth straight month.The supply of homes fell to 5.1 months' worth from 5.2 months in October. There are 250,000 new homes on the market, the most since 2009. The median sales price fell 3.7% vs. a year earlier to $305,400.As for homebuilder stocks, LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 0.9% on the stock market today.

772,L,"While the media do everything but spontaneously combust at the sight of President Trump, they ignore the other party in turmoil. Over the course of eight years, President Obama plunged the Democrats deep into a crater. But his media buddies paid no attention because nothing Democrats do or don't do bothers them.For weeks now, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Rep. Keith Ellison have been campaigning to lead the Democratic National Committee. And for weeks, the networks have ignored it. They would rather spend hours analyzing whether Trump is going to keep disrespecting them. (News flash: He will.)The actual event, the narrow election of Perez, who then created for Ellison a deputy chairman position, drew a minute or two of attention on the newscasts. Compared with the hostile ardor of their Trump coverage, it was sterile and (intentionally?) boring.This makes no sense. The media have hyperventilated about the ""alt-right"" and the anti-Semitism and the Islamophobia that are allegedly infecting the Republican Party. If that's acceptable journalism, why not pay attention to Ellison's radical record? Making him deputy chairman doesn't make it less newsworthy.You, dear reader, decide whether Ellison's past, as chronicled by the Washington Free Beacon, is disturbing and worthy of coverage. He compared 9/11 to the Reichstag fire that led to Hitler's rise. He defended Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam against (easily proven) charges of anti-Semitism. He said that black Americans don't have to obey the government because it considers them to be ""less than human."" And he met in Saudi Arabia with a radical Muslim cleric who endorsed the killing of U.S. soldiers.Perez also has a record on race worth recounting. The Free Beacon noted that as head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division, he dismissed a voter intimidation case against two members of the New Black Panther Party who threatened voters at a polling place in 2008. He also took the position that white people were not entitled to protection under the Voting Rights Act.But who needs scandal? The DNC publicity prize goes to PBS ""NewsHour"" co-anchor Judy Woodruff, who brought on Democrats Jaime Harrison and Symone Sanders on Feb. 24 and asked these open-ended whiffle balls:""What should the message of the Democratic Party be right now?""""Is there a positive message right now for Democrats?""""What's more important for Democrats now, to focus on winning back working-class white voters, or to shore up the Democratic base among African-Americans, among labor unions and so forth?""A college freshman could have penned a tougher inquiry. Washington Post reporter James Hohmann was the media-elitist outlier, suggesting that the narrative of this race ought to be that the Democrats lurched too far to the left to be competitive. On Feb. 13, he wrote after a candidates' forum: ""It was striking during a two-hour forum here in Charm City that not one of the 10 candidates for chairman suggested the party should moderate in response to last year's losses. Indeed, there was no substantive discussion about policy at all during the Saturday evening event. It was taken as a given that all the aspirants are committed liberals.""Analysts noted that Perez was one of the most progressive members of Obama's Cabinet, yet there were still obedient publicists like Jane Pauley on CBS announcing, ""(Perez's) election is seen as a win for the moderate wing of the party."" What moderate wing?Just as the media don't see their untrammeled advocacy against Trump as damaging to their brand, they don't see lurching further to the left as a problem for Democrats. In both cases, conservatives may enjoy watching them flail hopelessly inside their leftist bubble.RELATED:Is James Webb The Only Sane Democrat Left?Democrats' Biggest Problem?

773,L,"One after another, the pundits hailed President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress as his finest speech, though the usual naysayers were quick to snarkily add that it was his only good speech. Yuk-yuk. Fox News Channel's Brit Hume, a serious analyst with, by his count, some 40 of these speeches under his belt, called Tuesday night's address one of the most riveting and unforgettable speeches he's ever heard. Hume said the general consensus was Trump ""hit it out of the park.""We agree. We wish only that he'd given this speech in Cleveland when he accepted the Republican Party nomination, and that he'd made it his stump speech thereafter. We are absolutely convinced that had he done so, he would have demolished Hillary Clinton. What enraged his critics (and dismayed so many of his supporters) was the constant and boorish showmanship. Take that out of the equation, and millions would have come to his camp.One will be hard-pressed to tell Trump that he doesn't know how to address an audience. He will remind you that he has the word ""president"" in front of his name, while 16 other Republicans and one prominent Democrat at best can be called ""former presidential candidate."" But there's a world of difference between rhetoric designed to fuel a political rally and rhetoric designed for a presidential address to the nation — and to the world.Suddenly, all the Trumpian silliness was gone. The theme was visionary; the tone was positive; and in the greatest change of direction, especially after eight long years of President Obama's narcissism, there was true humility. We heard him use the first person singular only once (at the Democratic National Convention, Obama referred to himself 119 times). Instead, it was America. It was ""we."" It was Reagan.The speech was reminiscent of Jesse Jackson's 1984 Democratic National Convention speech. This was a man who rained left-wing hellfire on the world, angrily attacking everything in sight. Months before, he had called Jews ""Hymies"" living in ""Hymie-town."" At the convention, all eyes were on him, and he threw everyone an unexpected curveball.He said: ""If, in my low moments, in word, deed or attitude, through some error of temper, taste or tone, I have caused anyone discomfort, created pain or revived someone's fears, that was not my truest self. If there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance, please forgive me. Charge it to my head and not to my heart. ... I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant doing my best against the odds as I develop and serve. Be patient. God is not finished with me yet.""No, Trump didn't go there, nor did he need to. But his speech succeeded every bit as much as Jackson's, hailed as triumphant by friends and foes alike when he needed it most.Trump's enemies will not congratulate him — ever. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sat on her hands, glowering all night. Many Democrats refused to shake his hand. And Hollywood? Kathy Griffin called him an ""idiot."" Charlie Sheen called him a ""simpleton, Ho-ass piglet fraud."" George Takei said, ""Sorry, just had to get up to throw up."" Radical leftie Twitterville was alive with the usual insults.What did the public think? A CBS poll found that 76% of those who watched the speech approved. Even 40% of Democrats at least somewhat approved; eighteen percent strongly approved.The speech redefined Trump. It underscored the radical ugliness of so many of his opponents. As Hume said, it was a home run.Now, will he continue on this path, or go back?RELATED:With One Terrific Speech, Donald Trump Becomes President TrumpThe New York Times Rewrites History To Tarnish Trump SpeechTrump News & Tweets

774,L,"The highflying chip gear sector likely will face a near-term pullback, but the long-term outlook looks bright, an analyst reported Tuesday.Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in a report to clients that he expects sales of semiconductor wafer fab equipment, or WFE, to pull back 10% to 20% in the second half of 2017, but longer term the current growth cycle in the sector could extend to 2019. The current cycle started in early 2016.""We expect some near-term softness (in the semiconductor capital equipment industry) as we expect business to pull back after a series of sequential quarterly growth, but we are increasingly bullish for the long term,"" Mok said.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is ranked No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked. Several leading chip-gear stocks hit multiyear highs on Monday, including Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).""Historically, WFE stocks would decline 20%-plus on near-term softness, but we see a smaller pullback in the coming months as we expect investors who missed the recent run-up to become incremental buyers, picking up shares if they pull back,"" Mok said. ""Within our coverage, we highlight our Top Pick KLAC (strong buy).""Semiconductor capital equipment stocks are being helped by the shift to 3D chips from planar chips, he said.End markets for semiconductors are robust, Mok said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip industry stocks, including three chip gear makers: Advanced Energy Industries, Applied Materials and Lam Research.""With declining costs and ongoing performance improvements, semis are increasingly being deployed in new applications in markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, augmented/virtual reality, and artificial intelligence,"" Mok said. ""Moreover, the significant increase in digital content has led to data center investments to manage and store data, further bolstering demand for semis. We believe these trends will further expand overall semiconductor sales on top of demand from foundational markets such as PC, mobile and communication.""Needham rates Advanced Energy as buy with a price target of 70, Applied Materials as buy with a price target of 43, and KLA as strong buy with a price target of 105.

778,L," In February of this year, the first cargo of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) left Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass, Louisiana terminal headed for Brazil. Last month, nine ships filled with LNG left the Cheniere facility. Argentina, India, Chile, Spain, Jordan and even the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have received shipments of American LNG over the past year.This is all good news for the U.S. economy and our booming natural gas industry that, thanks to the shale revolution, has made us the world's No. 1 producer.According to the U.S. Department of Energy, America is now a net exporter of natural gas and will become the world's third largest exporter of LNG by 2020, a dramatic reversal from a decade ago when we were building facilities to import gas in response to a perceived shortage of domestic supply.But we've just begun to exploit the world market for LNG. Last year, an average 41 billion cubic feet of LNG was traded globally each day, the highest amount ever. This volume is projected to grow steadily as more natural gas is substituted for coal in power generation, in part to meet commitments by most countries to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the years ahead.U.S. exports of LNG so far this year amount to less than one-tenth of 1% of total world shipments. Luckily, at a current average price of about $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), American gas is the world's cheapest. Even adding in liquefaction and transportation costs, our LNG can still beat average landed prices of $5.53 in Japan and Korea, $4.46 in the United Kingdom, and $4.41 in the Baltic region.Unfortunately, our capacity to export is severely limited due to regulatory bottlenecks. Though an additional four export terminals are currently under construction, more than two dozen other applications are pending before the U.S. Department of Energy with half submitted before 2015. Regulatory hurdles are particularly onerous for projects that would send gas to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. In the meantime, other countries are beefing up their LNG export capacity, most notably Indonesia and Australia who are much closer to the huge Asian market.If the U.S. is to become a major competitor in the global gas market, we have to streamline and expedite approvals of LNG export projects. Legislation to accomplish this has been languishing in Congress for several years; but with a pro-energy president taking office in January, and a Congress of the same party, the prospects for expediting the permitting process should improve markedly.In addition to the obvious economic benefits to our domestic energy sector, increasing LNG exports can bring strategic advantages as well. At present, Russia is providing most of the gas to Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations and, from time to time, restricts supplies to exert political pressure, as with suspensions of gas deliveries to Ukraine for several months in 2014 and again in 2015. By selling more American gas into these markets, we can help break Gazprom's near monopoly.To this end, the ambassadors of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia recently sent a letter to congressional leaders urging action to accelerate LNG exports. In their letter, they point out that new import terminals have been opened in Lithuania and Poland that can facilitate deliveries not only to the Baltic States and Poland but also to Ukraine and Southern Europe through cross-border pipelines.In short, removing the constraints on exports of liquefied natural gas will not only improve the energy security of some of our key allies, it will also reduce Russia's bargaining power in Europe and further stimulate our own economy.

779,L,"Walt Disney (DIS) on Tuesday agreed to end ""on-call"" work scheduling in its stores, along with five other retailers to settle a multistate probe of the practice.Disney stores, along with teen-oriented apparel chains Aeropostale, Pacific Sunwear and Zumiez (ZUMZ), baby clothes store Carter's Inc. (CRI) and DavidsTea (DTEA), according to the New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was one of nine AGs investigating.Retailers have increasingly relied on last-minute scheduling to make sure they have enough staff, sometimes offering as little as an hour's notice. Computer technologies has made always on-call practices easier to employ. But while burdensome for teens, it can be extremely difficult for adults with children. And it makes it harder for workers to have a second job. Given that many low-wage businesses that tend to use on-call scheduling are restricting hours to avoid ObamaCare mandates and other regulations, workers may have set aside a huge amount of hours to come close to full-time work.""People should not have to keep the day open, arrange for child care, and give up other opportunities without being compensated for their time,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.The six retailers join several other, mostly youth-oriented chains, who agreed to similar steps in 2015 as part of the same probe. They include Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Gap (GPS), J. Crew Group (JCG), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB), Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and Urban Outfitters (URBN).Disney, Carter's DavidsTea and Zumiez also agreed to provide at least one week of notice in their scheduling.

781,L,"Lennar (LEN) on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, and the homebuilder said it was well positioned to benefit from economic growth under a Trump presidency despite the prospect of rising interest rates. But shares reversed morning gains after Lennar signaled caution about its gross margins.Earnings per share during the quarter rose 10% to $1.34, topping views for $1.29. Revenue increased 15% to $$3.376 billion, above estimates for $3.304 billion.Deliveries rose 7%, new orders rose 9%, and the company's backlog of homes rose 15%.Lennar said it believes a ""slow and steady recovery"" of the housing market is continuing.""With the anticipation of a new President focusing on accelerating economic growth, we believe that our fortified balance sheet, our diversified business model and our refined product offerings, will continue to hold us in good stead in a high-growth economy, despite the potential of moderately rising interest rates over the next several years,"" CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement.Lennar's optimism jibes with the NAHB Housing Market Index, which showed homebuilder confidence soaring in December to an 11-year high.That comes despite November's 18.7% dive in housing starts after they surged to a nine-year high in October. Multifamily starts have been especially volatile.IBD'S TAKE: As Lennar keeps its hopes high for the incoming president, an array of construction and steel stocks have also risen since the election on Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure. But during Lennar's post-earnings conference call with analysts, executives signaled caution about gross margins.

782,L,"Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in New York during the transition, and he took his family to Broadway to see ""Hamilton,"" the hot hip-hop Founding Fathers musical that people are overpaying to see. What resulted wasn't exactly surprising — rude and obnoxious, but not surprising.Pence entered the Richard Rodgers Theatre to both cheers and boos, which is unsurprising for national politicians at public events, especially sporting events. But during the curtain call, Pence was singled out from the stage.Actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Vice President Aaron Burr, lectured the vice president-elect, saying: ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us — our planet, our children, our parents — or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.""Can anyone imagine Broadway actors singling out a Democrat after a show to proclaim their alarm and anxiety over an election result? That's why you dismiss the absurdity that this ""diverse America"" of hard-left theater people represents anyone outside of the ZIP code in which they perform.Then it came out that Dixon and other ""Hamilton"" stars haven't voted in years. So much for the alarm and anxiety they've been feeling about the country. It's yet another reason to reject the pleadings of the elites who cannot conduct even the most basic exercise in the democratic process — voting — and yet demand their voices be respected.Pence knew going in that ""Hamilton"" has become some kind of a ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" crowd-participation event for Trump-hating liberals who cheer wildly at the musical's lyrics that boast about how much immigrants can do. Pence knew going in that the ""Hamilton"" folks hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in July — touted by ""news"" media as a ""boost of Tony-winning star power"" — with ticket prices ranging from $2,700 to $100,000.So who was reflecting a tolerance of diverse views, and who was ranting inside a bubble?The controversy took off when Donald Trump tweeted that Pence was ""harassed"" in the lecture and deserves an apology. ""Hamilton"" fans insisted the lecture was polite. It wasn't.Then The New York Times lectured from a half-mile away that this protest speech represented ""American principles like free speech, respect and the ability to challenge authority in the Trump era."" Now that is just hilarious. Lecture or heckle Pence, and you represent free speech. Lecture or heckle President Barack Obama, and the Times insists you represent white people's rancid failure to accept a black president.It's going to be a long four (or eight) years of the usual arrogant liberal mockery from the entertainment elite. On the American Music Awards, 21-year-old supermodel Gigi Hadid was hailed by liberal media elites for a bad Melania Trump impression in which she repeating the tired Michelle Obama-plagiarism joke.Liberals couldn't imagine that a large chunk of red-state America is tired of multimillionaire supermodels and Broadway starts telling them that they represent the common people. Earth to the elites: You don't represent the common people. The election was not just a dismissal of your candidate but a rejection of your condescension.

784,L," One of the world's last brutal communist dictators, Cuba's Fidel Castro, died last week at the age of 90. While Cuban exiles celebrated long into the night, on America's ""objective"" networks, they pulled out hankies and mourned this despot's filthy works and celebrated the hellhole he made.ABC's Jim Avila made the Founding Fathers roll over in their graves by touting how Castro ""was considered, even to this day, the George Washington of his country among those who remain in Cuba."" Notice only ""those who remain"" -- under the thumb of the Castros -- can be counted as fans.On MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell unspooled the usual nonsense about how Castro ""gave his people better health care and education."" She said that Castro ""will be revered"" for giving ""education and social services and medical care to all of his people.""The dictator was dead, and they were still spreading his official lies about a terrific health care system -- where the doctors are paid $30 to $50 a month or are shipped to socialist ""partners"" like Venezuela. Brian ""Fake News"" Williams of MSNBC claimed that Cubans use donkey carts alongside automobiles ""because that's exactly what they'd rather have for transportation.""Would Williams prefer being shuttled to 30 Rock by donkey?This charade has been going on since Castro shot his way into power in 1959. The left just spent an election cycle talking about the (liberal) truth vs. ""false equivalence,"" but the very best the left-wing media can do now is report that ""some say"" Castro was a ruthless dictator, and ""some say"" he was Havana's version of George Washington.There was no ""objective"" on-the-other-hand coverage when former right-wing Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet — who allowed a peaceful transfer of power to democracy in 1990 — died 10 years ago.Back then, The New York Times headline screamed, ""Augusto Pinochet, Dictator Who Ruled By Terror in Chile, Dies at 91."" Jonathan Kandell of the Times began by describing him as ""the brutal dictator who repressed and reshaped Chile for nearly two decades and became a notorious symbol of human rights abuse and corruption.""The Washington Post headline for Pinochet's death read, ""A Chilean Dictator's Dark Legacy."" Reporters Monte Reel and J.Y. Smith stated that his government ""murdered and tortured thousands during his repressive 17-year rule ... leaving a legacy of abuse that took successive governments years to catalogue.""But what about Castro? The Times' headline read, ""A Revolutionary Who Defied the U.S. and Held Cuba In His Thrall."" Anthony DePalma of the Times began by calling Castro a ""fiery apostle of revolution"" who ""defied the United States for nearly half a century.""The Post headline was slightly more balanced: ""Revolutionary remade Cuba: Dictator who defied U.S. was loathed, beloved."" Kevin Sullivan and J.Y. Smith oozed that Castro was ""a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots, chomping monstrous cigars through a bushy black beard,"" who ""became a spiritual beacon for the world's political far left.""So let's look at the legacy of this so-called romantic figure. He outlawed Christianity and persecuted Christians (mostly Catholics). He executed some 10,000 political prisoners; and many continue to languish in his prisons. He aided and abetted dictators and terrorists from Angola to Nicaragua. He plundered his treasury, living in sheer luxury while his citizens lived in squalor.He allowed the Soviets to place nuclear missiles aimed at the U.S. on his soil and urged Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to launch them during the Cuban missile crisis, which might well have killed millions of Americans.And the current president of the United States can't think of a single thing to criticize.

788,L,"The biggest shopping season of the year is upon us. Will holiday sales get a Trump bump? Is Amazon's (AMZN) gradual decimation of brick-and-mortar shops an inevitability? Is this still a terrible time to be a department store?Like a white elephant exchange at an office holiday party, it's not clear whether everyone will be happy once all the gifting's done.Among clothiers, Gap (GPS), parent to Banana Republic, Old Navy and its flagship brand, is expected to log a 1.2% same-store sales decline during the December quarter, according to Retail Metrics estimates. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) is seen growing comps 1.5%.Handbag makers Kate Spade (KATE) and Coach (COH) are likely to have a merry Christmas quarter with projected comp growth of 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, while peer Michael Kors (KORS) is expected to drop 4.4%.Overall, early December figures appear sluggish so far. Research firm NPD Group said Wednesday that dollar sales for the week ending Dec. 3, the fifth week of the holiday shopping season, had dropped 5% from the same prior-year period.Shoppers are still buying sneakers, though. Athletic footwear sales for the week rose 2%, the only industry to outperform that week, said the firm.Nike (NKE) shares fell 1% to 51.29 on the stock market today. Nike will report quarterly earnings next Tuesday. Under Armour (UA) shares sank 2.9%.Personal computers, home automation, athletic leisure footwear, outdoor and sports toys made NPD's top five, with wearables cracking the top performers list for the first time.Fitbit (FIT) widened its lead in the wearables market in Q3, said tracking firm IDC earlier in the month. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) Watch shipments plummeted 71% during the period. But Fitbit issued a grim holiday outlook, while Apple might fare better now that its Apple Watch 2 is out.Apple iPads were widely reported to be big sellers over Thanksgiving weekend, thanks to doorbuster deals. The Apple iPhone 7 also should be a solid seller, even if the latest generation isn't seen as revolutionary.Apple shares rose 0.55% to 115.82, closing in on a 118.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: After initially lagging during the Trump market rally, Apple, Amazon and other big-cap techs are shaping up for potential breakouts.For November, department stores sales slipped 0.2%, and apparel sales were flat, according to the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Overall retail sales rose 0.1% from October, falling short of expectations.Retail Metrics sees a 1.5% drop in Macy's (M) holiday-quarter same-store sales but expects rival department stores J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nordstrom (JWN) to log decent gains.Big-box heavyweight Wal-Mart (WMT) should log 1.2% same-store sales growth, according to Retail Metrics.The National Retail Federation appeared bullish on holiday spending, and said that November's results point to figures that will meet or exceed its holiday sales forecast of 3.6% growth. (The forecast spans the November and December shopping period.)""The combination of job and wage gains led to solid holiday spending by American households,"" said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz in a statement Wednesday.RELATED:November Retail Sales Rose Just 0.1%: No Trump Holiday Bump?Apple Watch Q3 Shipments Plunge; Fitbit Lead Widens In Wearables

801,L,"As the Trump transition team works to determine the top priorities for the new administration, a very serious problem requires the immediate attention of the new president: the future of our manufacturing industry. A healthy manufacturing base is critical to America's survival, both militarily and economically. Yet China poses a significant threat to our nation's all important manufacturing sector.Right now there is an intensive cyberwar waged against the U.S. by China, in which the Chinese are aggressively hacking into thousands of U.S. companies, stealing their intellectual property, and then flooding markets with their own ripped-off, competing products. Even worse, China is ""dumping"" these products into the U.S. at prices so low that they could eventually drive our manufacturing industry out of business.Sadly, there are too many examples of China's illegal activities to mention here, but a top example is China's nonstop campaign to undermine the U.S. steel industry, the backbone of our manufacturing. Chinese actions will have disastrous consequences if left unchecked.U.S. Steel invested millions in the development of a lighter, stronger steel. The company is presently suing 30 Chinese companies and their distributors, saying Chinese hackers stole trade secrets for this steel and China is now manufacturing its own copycat steel products and dumping the products into the U.S. at prices so low that they are impossible to match.In 2000, China produced approximately 14% of the world's steel, according to the World Steel Association. China is now manufacturing nearly half of all the world's steel products and last year, exported 112 million metric tons of steel, a 20% increase over a record-setting 2014.At a time when domestic energy production has skyrocketed and labor costs are coming down, the United States should be experiencing a manufacturing revival. Instead, the U.S. steel industry has been the target of continued illegal foreign practices and suffered 16,000 layoffs since the beginning of 2015, with more job losses expected throughout steel-producing communities.Unfortunately, China's cyber-thievery is not limited to the steel industry. A 2013 report from a bipartisan Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property stated, ""The scale of international theft of American intellectual property (IP) is unprecedented — hundreds of billions of dollars per year, on the order of the size of U.S. exports to Asia.""It concludes, ""China is the world's largest source of IP theft.""The FBI acknowledges an alarming increase in the theft of American trade secrets. An official with the counterintelligence unit was quoted last year as saying American companies have lost hundreds of billions of dollars due to theft of trade secrets. The FBI surveyed 165 private companies and found that half of them had fallen victim to IP theft, with 95% of those cases linked to Chinese cyber-hackers.Sources at the Justice Department also acknowledge a relentless wave of cybercrime saying thousands of companies in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy have been targeted by the Chinese. Counterintelligence officials also say that despite public pledges by China to end cybertheft, there is no indication that China's hackers have backed off.Cyberattacks threaten our national defense as well. The Washington Post reports that it's believed Chinese cyber-spies are responsible for hacking into major defense companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The spies obtained data and designs for more than two dozen major military weapons systems, including aircraft designs, missile defense, and communications.And it's not just steel and defense companies, corporations across a gamut of industries are victims of cybertheft. Hackers allegedly stole years of emerging energy technology research from SolarWorld and Westinghouse Electric. Paint company Valspar lost $20 million, or one-eighth of its annual profit, after its proprietary information was stolen by a Chinese rival.Chinese cyber-thieves have become so adept and skillful, they are even hacking into companies to view international trade strategies, bidding information and other forms of proprietary data that give China's manufacturing industry a decisive leg-up in world markets.China is not only expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, but also has created a massive cyberattack army that works every day to crush American companies by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property. Donald Trump and the incoming Congress must demonstrate strong support for our companies and help punish cyberattackers, and they must invest more in U.S. counterintelligence capabilities so that America can win what so far has been a devastating cyberwar.

803,L,"Dear Mr. President-elect,Everyone else is giving you advice, so why can't we? (Then again, the last time you asked for our advice, we told you over lunch that winning was not in the cards, so you might be hitting the delete button before this sentence is complete.)But here it comes. Five thoughts.1. Relax. This campaign's over. It was brutal, with haymakers start to finish (and yes, we'll say it: a few sucker punches, too). But it's over; you won against all odds. And what odds they were.The entire establishment was arrayed against you and did everything to vilify you. It was the establishment Republican Party. You were a direct threat to their fiefdoms, so they tried to destroy you. When they failed, most headed for the tall grass rather than to support you -- now, of course, while they were with you all along. Let 'em squirm.Establishment Democrats? Even better. When the swamp is drained, they're headed down the commode with the rest of the sewage, and they know it. Enjoy the scene. It will be something out of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" except in this case the zombies that have been feasting on America will be headed over a cliff.Hollywood? Academia? They won't be able to build safe spaces fast enough for this crowd. In fact, they'll probably come to you for infrastructure funding. Resist. Suggest they work out their aggressions with therapeutic wall-building.2. Laugh. Nothing infuriates the left more than to see someone who not only is not intimidated by them but also bursts out laughing at them when attacked. (See Rush Limbaugh.) Watch your popularity soar. It won't be just that supposedly ""angry"" base that will chuckle along. This will transcend your base. Your political enemies in Washington will attack you viciously and personally. Don't take the bait. Go Reagan and laugh. You will bring millions to your side. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, especially when my friend is ridiculing my enemy.3. Pick and choose your TV spots. President Obama could safely navigate TV at will because the entertainment industry unanimously slobbered over him, unlike any president in modern history. That ain't gonna happen with you. The Stephen Colberts and Bill Mahers despise you and will low-blow you at every opportunity. Refuse their invitations for appearances. More importantly, demand that no one in your administration give these leftists the time of day.That said, there are those in that industry who will poke fun at you without the ugly edge -- Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, etc. You've shown a thick skin with them. Keep it up. Take a page from President George H. W. Bush. No one laughed harder at Dana Carvey's devastating impersonation of him -- and that was at the White House with Carvey as his guest.4. Stop tweeting! @realDonaldTrump #itisgettingreallyold. You were right to say that tweeting is a terrific way to communicate directly with the American people. You showed your marketing brilliance by employing this weapon before anyone. It worked beautifully for you.But enough. You're the president-elect now. It's so beneath the office! It's sad! The public expects leadership and gravitas. It could be embarrassing! You don't need to use this medium. It's unnecessary! When you need to say something formally, let your staff release a statement. Want to personalize that statement? Conduct an interview. You'll never disappoint.5. Pay attention to the experts -- not. The editors at The New York Times and the Washington Post have serious thoughts on the direction your administration should take. There are profound ideas coming from seasoned political observers at PBS and NPR. I know it doesn't appear this way, but the anchors (and producers and reporters and executives) at NBC, ABC and CBS do want to help.By all means, have them in for a chat. Hear them out. Then laugh out loud while you throw them out. Watch as they pull out their cellphones on the sidewalk to furiously tweet their feelings to the world:""@realDonaldTrump hurt our feelings! #needasafespace! #whereismygriefcounselor? Sad!"" RELATED:Media Malpractice? Media Bias And The 2016 ElectionThe Real Reason the Media Got This Election All WrongGot Fake News? Biased Press Continues To Misinform Public About Trump

805,L,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) beat-and-raise quarter and whopping 16.7% same-store sales growth make the specialty shop something of a unicorn in the rather uncertain world of retail. What's driving growth? Good investments by management plus a broad consumer enthusiasm for beauty products, say the experts.""ULTA's multi-year investment spend is clearly generating positive results (improved ecommerce, targeted marketing, product mix, in-store experience, new planning/forecasting systems) as the concept continues to attract new customers to the box,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, who rates the stock market perform.Ulta shares shot up to 273.90 soon after the opening bell, clearing a 268.88 buy point briefly. But the stock reversed to trade down as low as 244.75, finding support at the 50-day line. Ulta closed down 1.6% at 253.39 in the stock market today. It wasn't clear why Ulta reversed lower.Something similar happened after its Q2 earnings report, when Ulta delivered strong results but shares tumbled 6% the following day and continued to slide for the next few weeks. But with that report, Q3 guidance was a little cautious. That was not the case with Ulta's Thursday report, which included a solid Q4 outlook.Q3 comps were driven by both transaction (11.1%) and average ticket growth (5.6%). Retail comps rose 14.3%, including 10.3% salon comps.The in-house salons and makeup services ""keep Ulta 'un-Amazon-able,' "" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who believes that its service offering ""continues to become more compelling,"" particularly with the addition of online booking. He has an outperform rating on Ulta.While Amazon.com (AMZN) threatens to devour other retailers whole, Ulta's e-commerce sales rose 59.1% during the quarter.IBD's TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Beauty has been pegged, for now, as an Amazon-proof market. The experiential nature of cosmetics and skin care products means that shoppers like to see and try items in person, bringing foot traffic into brick-and-mortar locations. (Plus, the in-store experience is designed to be engaging — look at the product-tester playground that is Sephora.)Ulta's rewards program grew 28% to 21.7 million active members, year over year, bolstering its strong base of loyal shoppers.It's unclear as to when Amazon and other e-tailers might begin to encroach on Ulta and Sephora's precious beauty space. And high valuation concerns dog Ulta's stock.Perish the thought, says Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel.""We think investors should ignore the hang up and buy the best retailer in the business, or wait for market pullbacks & do it then,"" he wrote, ""as ULTA is proving repeatedly that it sits at the top of the retail pack, in our view.""And as the beauty train chugs along, value beauty brand e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) could also stand to benefit. Cowen says ""the momentum and significant addressable market size ULTA sees for this consumer bodes well for long-term sustainable growth for ELF.""E.l.f. shares fell 1.7% to 29.65 after rising as high as 30.69 and dropping as low as 29.05. The stock is in buy range again from a 29.02 buy point first cleared on Nov. 14. E.l.f., which came public at 17 in late September, plunged 4.2% on Thursday, moving back into the entry zone.

806,L,"Donald Trump is a persistent critic of the media and is attacked for not granting them enough access. But three days after the election, there he was, the president-elect, recording a long interview with Lesley Stahl of CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" whom he could expect to push, push, push from the left.Stahl presented him as a terror for minorities: ""I want to ask you all about something that's going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They're really afraid. African-Americans think there's a target on their back. Muslims are terrified."" Trump accurately replied that's ""horrible,"" but it's ""built up by the press.""She kept channeling fears. Are you really going to build a wall and deport millions? Are you really going to appoint a Supreme Court justice that will overturn Roe v. Wade? Are you really going to repeal and replace ObamaCare? Are you really going to appoint a special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton's email fiasco?CBS News presented Trump's election as a nightmare for everyone — including the millions who eagerly voted for him — and heavily implied he needs to take back every campaign promise it can't abide. This is how the media try to run America between the elections. Stahl wants to repeal and replace the decision voters just made.And yet, the liberals were unsatisfied with CBS. New York Daily News columnist Gersh Kuntzman complained, ""Lesley Stahl played the Matt Lauer role on '60 Minutes' on Sunday night, letting President-elect Trump off the hook on virtually every issue."" Apparently, she needed to slap him after every unsatisfactory answer.If liberals want to know what it's like to let a new president off the hook, go back to 2008. On Nov. 9, the first Sunday after the election, ""60 Minutes"" interviewed then-President elect Barack Obama's campaign aides David Axelrod, David Plouffe, Robert Gibbs and Anita Dunn. Interviewer Steve Kroft asked in amazement: ""You ran an incredibly effective and disciplined campaign, maybe the most effective, I mean, certainly one of the most effective presidential campaigns that's ever been run. There was no infighting, no real leaks, almost no turnover. How did you manage that? Even the Republicans were in awe.""No one was asked about the American people being terrified of Obama. No one was asked whether Obama would scare people by daring to enact things he promised during the campaign. No one asked how easy it is to look ""effective and disciplined"" with a supine media.On Nov. 16, 2008, Kroft suggested to Obama that he could be the next Franklin Delano Roosevelt: ""People are comparing this to 1932. ... Is that a valid comparison, do you think?"" Obama didn't accept the hyperbole: ""Well, keep in mind that (in) 1932 (and) 1933 the unemployment rate was 25%, inching up to 30%.""Like Stahl, Kroft pressed from the left, asking, ""How high a priority are you placing on re-regulation of the financial markets?"" He also pressed Obama to say whether he will ""take early action"" to issue executive orders ""to shut down Guantanamo Bay"" and ""change interrogation methods that are used by U.S. troops?"" Obama said, ""I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that.""This is why anyone who watches television news for an hour or two knows CBS and the rest of the ""objective"" media favor the left. They're going to spend the next four years doubling down on their effort to tar Trump as a politically incorrect horror and lunging to prevent everything conservative that Trump ever promised to implement. The only path for him to get positive coverage is to cave in desperately to their agenda.RELATED:Enjoying Hollywood's DoomsayingTrump's Right — The Media Is RiggedMedia Blackout Exposes Corrupt Media

Meanwhile, Chicago-area factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November.Pending home sales rose 0.1% last month, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected a 0.8% increase. The index measures contract signings of existing homes. That foreshadows what existing-home sales closings will likely be in a month or two.NAR cited ongoing tight supply of homes for sales for limiting demand. But mortgage rates also were rising. After the Nov. 8 election, mortgage rates skyrocketed along with Treasury yields as investors bet on Federal Reserve rate hikes and higher inflation in a Trump administration. Treasury yields rose sharply again on Wednesday, signaling mortgage rates will keep rising.That could make housing less affordable, especially for first-time buyers struggling to qualify for credit.Shares of homebuilders fell on the stock market today.

810,L,"New-home sales in October fell to an annual rate 563,000 from a downwardly revised 574,000 in the prior month, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday, even before interest rates began to surge after the election of Donald Trump.Economists expected a dip to an annualized 590,000 from the 593,000 initially reported in September.Housing stocks haven't entirely sat out the post-election rally, despite the outlook for higher interest rates, but they've missed out on explosive gains seen by other sectors.The 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 2.38% on Wednesday after the Commerce Department reported robust durable goods orders. That's up 50 basis points since Trump's election and a full percentage point from historical lows in July.With mortgage rates tracking Treasuries, mortgage applications sank after the election. A spike in mortgage rates over the past week may have been a rush to get in on rates before they keep climbing.October existing-home sales rose to their highest level since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday. But home resales reflect closings, while new-home sales reflect more-recent contract signings.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group is ranked No. 113 out of 197 industry groups, based on stock-price performance. The best performers in the group include William Lyon Homes (WLH), Century Communities (CCS) and LGI Homes (LGIH).William Lyon Homes edged higher, Century Communities was unchanged and LGI Homes down a fraction in morning trade on the stock market today.Among bigger builders, KB Home (KBH) and Pulte Group (PHM) rose about 1% intraday, while D.R.

811,L,"Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly climbed in October to the highest level since February 2007, a sign of momentum in the housing market a month before a jump in borrowing costs, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday.Existing-home sales rose 2% to a 5.60 million annual rate, above views for about 5.44 million. The median sales price rose 6% vs. a year earlier to $232,000.The supply of available homes fell 4.3% vs. October 2015 to 2.02 million, the 17th straight year-over-year decline. At the current pace, it would take 4.3 months to sell the houses on the market, the quickest since January and down from 4.4 months in September. NAR deems six months' supply as normal.Credit steady job growth and accelerating wage gains for fueling demand despite limited inventory that's pushing up prices.But housing demand may falter going forward. October existing-home sales reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier. Since then, mortgage rates have risen sharply, especially since Donald Trump's surprise election win sent Treasury yields soaring. The 30-year mortgage rate has risen to a three-year high.That could curb home buying, especially from millennials and other first-time buyers.The October advance ""may be indicative of pent-up demand that was unrealized in the summer,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors group in Washington, told reporters as the data were released. More recently, ""with the rise in rates, we may begin to see some modest reduction in home sales."" As long as there's job creation, the impact should be ""minimal.""Mortgage applications tumbled last week to their lowest level since January, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.""This is all very encouraging, but it has to be seen in the context of the recent decline in mortgage applications, which if sustained likely will push home sales down sharply in the early part of next year,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd., said in a note. ""We expect further declines in demand as rates climb.Housing-related stocks were mixed. Tuesday afternoon.LGI Homes (LGIH) advanced 2.6% and KB Home (KBH) 0.7%. But D.R.

813,L,"High expectations got the better of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) last quarter, despite solid results and bumped-up guidance. Could that happen to the specialty beauty retailer again, even if its third-quarter results shine late Thursday?As of Monday, Wall Street analysts are anticipating per-share profit to rise 23% to $1.37 a share on 22% revenue growth to $1.11 billion.Cosmetics and skin care are retail standouts. Specialty shops Ulta and LVMH-owned Sephora have been riding the beauty trends, with Ulta able to serve up double-digit same-store sales growth during a time when many other retailers are hoping for comps that are simply in the black. And analysts often call out Ulta Beauty as a top retail pick, immune to the charms of shopping on Amazon (AMZN).So why would investors expect anything but a rally from positive results? A quick recap:Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 results in late August, shares tumbled over 6% and sank below their 50-day line. Slightly light Q3 profit guidance and concerns of high valuation were tossed around as possible causes.One equity strategist even mused on Twitter that male investors might not ""get"" the beauty business.Since then, however, Ulta has raised its Q3 and full-year guidance. For the 2016 fiscal year, it now expects mid-20% EPS growth and 12%-14% comps gains, up from low- to mid-20% growth and 11%-13% increases, respectively.Shares popped back up above their key 50-day level on the news.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta isn't the only retailer taking advantage of shopper lust for beauty products. Department stores and mall names are trying to build on a social media-driven interest in makeup to lure in foot traffic: ""How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of Retail.""Flash forward to the present: Ulta fell 0.8% to 261.60 in the stock market today, after hitting 265.38 earlier.

814,L,"CNN's Brian Stelter sent around an Election Day email declaring ""This is the year of the fact-checker."" He joked, ""Trump made fact-checking great again.""""It's really remarkable to see how big news operations have come around to challenging false and deceitful claims directly. It's about time,"" said Brooks Jackson, the director emeritus of FactCheck.org.PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said, ""All of the media has embraced fact-checking because there was a story that really needed it."" She was singling out Trump: ""(T) he level of inaccuracy is startling."" PolitiFact founder Bill Adair boasted: ""Is this the post-truth election, as people have claimed? No. It's actually the thank-goodness-there-are-fact-checkers election.""The rise of ""fact-checking"" in the American media is now honored in a new book called ""Deciding What's True."" Unsurprisingly, the author, University of Wisconsin professor Lucas Graves, focused first on how journalists challenged President Reagan's ""well-established reputation for error and exaggeration.""From the Reagan years to today, conservatives have been dismissed by the press as the ""poor, uneducated and easy to command"" types. Thirty years later, nothing's changed.It's precisely this long-standing ideological arrogance — that conservatives are both intellectually challenged and the most resistant to what ""objective"" journalists define as reality — informing the fact-checkers. Throughout this election cycle, liberal journalists have touted the honesty and factual accuracy of Hillary Clinton by grading her on a curve with Donald Trump based on the verdicts of these biased fact-checkers.Trump can be careless with facts, and resistant to media shaming. But for these fact-checkers to claim Clinton is far more honest is preposterous. PolitiFact awarded its ""Pants on Fire"" tag to Trump 57 times to Clinton's seven. Likewise, Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler reported that ""Trump earned significant more four-Pinocchio ratings than Clinton — 59 to 7,"" and ""The numbers don't lie.""Well, yes, they do. Just ask the parents of the brave men murdered in Benghazi if Clinton lies. Ask the FBI — even Director Comey, who exonerated her. Ask those who held hearings in the House and Senate and listened to her testimony. Ask those who have investigated the Clinton Foundation. They and so many others will speak to her endless lies. But not so the ""fact checkers.""It is a given that the default position for the media elite is to rate liberal politicians ""True"" and conservatives of every faction ""False."" Take the vice presidential candidates on the PolitiFact ""Truth-o-Meter"" in this campaign. Tim Kaine was rated ""True"" or ""Mostly True"" 26 times, and Mike Pence drew those positive ratings only 8 times. Pence was ""False"" or ""Mostly False"" 18 times, and Kaine drew those marks only 11 times. Since Sept. 1, conservatives and Republicans have been scolded as ""Pants on Fire"" 28 times (fully 14 of those tags were for Trump). Liberals and Democrats? Only four (and only one for Clinton). That's a 7-to-1 tilt, and an obscene 14-to-1 tilt for the presidential candidates.PolitiFact founding editor Bill Adair recently admitted this was an awfully subjective racket. (Ya think?) When a supportive interviewer suggested their measurements contained some personal opinion, Adair admitted, ""(Y) eah, we're human. We're making subjective decisions. Lord knows the decision about a Truth-O-Meter rating is entirely subjective. As Angie Holan, the editor of PolitiFact, often says, the Truth-O-Meter is not a scientific instrument.""In a review of the Graves book in The Washington Post, Heidi Moore asserted that Graves ""shies away from branding any politician a liar, noting that fact-checkers never use the term."" Are these analysts so dim as to think a ""Pants on Fire"" rating doesn't strongly imply ""liar""? Or The Washington Post Fact Checker's ""Four Pinocchios"" doesn't imply a falsehood?It's time to fact-check the fact checkers. In fact, it's already been done. According to a recent Rasmussen poll, just 29% of likely voters trust media fact-checking of the candidates, while 62% believed the media ""skew the facts to help candidates they support.""Don't you just love the American people? They have awarded on big, fat ""Pants on Fire"" to the entire national news media for their fact-checking arrogance and plain old dishonesty. And that's a fact.

But the Target, Macy's and JCPenney (JCP) stores they visited in Minnesota and Texas appeared to have a lot of apparel and accessory inventory still left.""Several specialty-store managers indicated this could be the last year they open on Thanksgiving given how erratic the consumer in-store conversion is on Thursday night,"" they reported, noting that some stores looked over-staffed.FBR analysts said that Thanksgiving and Black Friday was ""once again diluted by online sales"" and promotions from earlier in the month.Which bags were most commonly seen being toted around the mall?

817,L,"While most of America was transfixed by Game 7 of the World Series, Fox News Channel was doggedly pursuing a new story: The FBI's probe into pay-for-play schemes at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department has been far more expansive than anyone reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. FBI sources even warned there could be indictments down the road.Then, The Wall Street Journal broke another new story online, saying, ""Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay."" Senior officials wanted to tell FBI agents to ""stand down"" from a Clinton Foundation probe.That's two nuclear explosions in one night. What was the reaction from the news media? Crickets.The stench of corruption between the Justice Department, the State Department and the Clinton Foundation machine is noxious. Add the leftist ""news"" media collusion and it becomes overpowering. This is a cover-up.No one at ABC, CBS or NBC was breaking from the World Series. They couldn't locate the Clinton story and offer even the briefest summary the next morning. MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski offered a serious report early on ""Morning Joe,"" but she was alone. The other ""news"" programs preferred the distraction of breathless baseball updates.The worst moment came on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" where they acted like the story did not exist. Political analyst Matthew Dowd noted a scandal story might still break. ""So, anything can happen in that regard,"" he said. Sounding totally oblivious to the breaking news, co-host George Stephanopoulos replied, ""We'll see if some big news comes out.""At taxpayer-funded National Public Radio, ""Morning Edition"" found anything and everything else more interesting and ""newsworthy,"" including — we're not kidding — ""teen night owls"" who need later school start times and the perils of the illegal kidney trade in Pakistan.The network blackout so far on this FBI probe is beyond the pale. Everyone knows what the media reaction would be were there a report about indictments related to the Trump Foundation. There would be an immediate flash mob of reporters camped in front of Trump Tower, breaking away from regularly scheduled programming and offering play-by-play commentary. Anyone denying the double standard is lying.This is just the latest Clinton scandal scoop out of hundreds over the last 24 years that the networks have skipped or downplayed or just dismissed as toxic waste. This is why an overwhelming majority of Americans tell pollsters it's obvious the media are undisguised Hillary boosters. Their credibility is shot with the public.Within 18 hours, MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell was bizarrely denying there was any story or any investigation worth noting. She said: ""She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there's no criminality.""This is the kind of spin you expect from defense attorneys, not reporters.It's sinking in across America that our ""news"" media are not First Amendment heroes or watchdogs of government. Many of them are coddling deeply corrupt politicians and denying any evidence that these people have been engaged in what appears to be a criminal conspiracy to enrich themselves using the federal government.We are looking right down the barrel of the greatest government crisis since the Civil War, with charges — like handing over our uranium mining capacity to the Russians — that could possibly reach the height of treason itself.And there's no coverage. RELATED:The Clinton Foundation Scandal Special ReportThe Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedIBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll

818,L,"An Obama administration policy that would have given more white-collar workers overtime starting Dec. 1 was blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Texas.The decision Tuesday is a victory for 21 states and dozens of business groups that sued, complaining the new rule would increase government costs in their states by $115 million next year alone and would put private employers on the hook for millions of dollars more, possibly leading to layoffs.It's the fourth time in 21 months that a federal judge in Texas has issued a nationwide injunction blocking one of President Barack Obama's executive orders. Other stalled Obama initiatives involve shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation, mandating bathroom access for transgender students, and requiring labor-violation disclosures by federal contractors.President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to roll back federal regulations on business, so he could choose to reverse or cancel the new overtime rule. The Republican Congress also could move on legislation to take similar action.IBD'S TAKE: Some restaurant chains have been shifting managers to hourly employees as a way to avoid higher costs under the overtime rule.The rule would have doubled the maximum salary cap to $47,892 a year for full-time executive, administrative and professional workers to be exempt from overtime pay requirements. The higher cutoff, along with a provision to periodically increase it, would have extended overtime protections to millions of full-time salaried workers, just 7 percent of whom are currently protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act compared with 62 percent in 1975, according to the government.U.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant III in Sherman, Texas, rejected a request by the federal government to limit any order to the states that filed the lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction blocking the new salary cutoff nationwide.By requiring employers to pay overtime wages based on salary rather than an employee's duties, the Labor Department exceeded its authority under the Fair Labor Standards Act and ignored Congress's intent, Mazzant said in his ruling. ""If Congress intended the salary requirement to supplant the duties test, then Congress and not the department, should make that change,"" he said.The White House declined to immediately comment on the ruling.The U.S. Labor Department failed to consider regional salary and economic differences in setting the nationwide base pay rate, opponents said in challenging the new rule. They also complained the Obama administration disregarded the abilities of smaller public and private employers to pay higher salaries that would automatically ratchet up every three years.The arguments by both sides turned partly on rule-making requirements under federal law.The states -- all of them except Louisiana headed by Republican governors -- claim the Obama administration usurped Congress's exclusive authority to set minimum wages and ignored the requirement to allow public comment before the statutory salary level automatically indexes every three years.Labor Department officials said they followed all federal rule-making procedures, evaluating more than 270,000 public comments before finalizing the change.Justice Department lawyers had asked Mazzant to at least let the new rule take effect in the 29 states that didn't sue, to update salary triggers that haven't changed since 2004. Rising wages and broad workplace definitions of what constitutes white-collar jobs have ""left employees who should not be exempt without overtime protection,"" the government said in court filings.The case is Nevada v U.S. Department of Labor, 16-00731, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman).

821,L,"Rush Limbaugh found just the right analogy for the CNN cheating scandal, where (now) former CNN analyst Donna Brazile fed ""town hall"" questions to Hillary Clinton. It's the quiz-show scandal of the 1950s, where Charles Van Doren was given the questions on the NBC game show ""Twenty-One"" in advance and looked like a genius on national television. Van Doren later apologized to America, saying, ""I have deceived my friends, and I had millions of them.""That's not the way CNN and Brazile reacted when exposed by the WikiLeaks emails. In the first incriminating email, Brazile told the Clinton team, ""From time to time I get the questions in advance"" and shared a question on the death penalty that Clinton would be asked on CNN's March 13 town hall.When the cheating was uncovered, CNN claimed Brazile didn't get the question from CNN sources, but instead from TV One's Roland Martin, who had been a longtime paid CNN analyst. For his part, Martin denied sending Brazile the question. But she had it word for word. Brazile denied the very email, saying, ""I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did."" She even deepened the deception by protesting to Fox's Megyn Kelly, saying, ""As a Christian woman, I understand persecution, but I will not sit here and be persecuted.""Then, on Oct. 31, the other shoe fell, deepening the lie. WikiLeaks released another email in which Brazile promised the Clintonites more town hall questions — ""I'll send a few more."" Brazile had also tipped Clinton aide John Podesta before a March 6 CNN debate in Flint, Michigan, that one local woman whose ""family has lead poison ... will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the (people) of Flint.""What was CNN to do? The networks' response was as bizarre as Brazile's was dishonest. CNN claimed it had accepted her resignation on Oct. 14 — 17 days prior.The ""public's right to know"" stops at the water's edge of journalism.But why accept the resignation? CNN had a responsibility to fire Brazile for cheating, and it didn't. CNN staged a phony event, and it got caught. So, like good liberals, it's playing the victim card and blaming Roland Martin.Online, a CNN spokeswoman claimed, ""We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor."" CNN insisted it ""never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate."" What about on CNN's airwaves, where it happened? Media reporters Brian Stelter and Dylan Byers — hour-by-hour fixtures for a Trump scandal or a Fox News controversy — disappeared. Brazile's name went unmentioned after the news broke around noon on Halloween.On the morning of Nov. 1, it came up again on ""New Day"" when Republican Rep. Chris Collins raised it, saying, ""Your own network, CNN, had to fire Donna Brazile on October 14th, for getting the town hall questions ahead of time, leaking them to the Clinton campaign."" CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota changed the subject, asking, ""But congressman, how about the connections between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia?""CNN's fraudulent programming and its unwillingness to own up to it on television is another reason why trust in the media is at an all-time low (according to Gallup), and why a new USA Today poll reports that by nearly 10 to 1, the American people say the media want Clinton to win. CNN's reputation has been sullied by this shameful episode. It really is the Clinton News Network.

Beauty cleared a buy point and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is attempting to retake its 50-day line.E.l.f. shares jumped 8.8% to 29.37 on the stock market today, clearing its IPO base buy point of 29.02. The stock hit a record 30.50 intraday.Late Thursday, e.l.f. -- which makes low-cost makeup and brushes sold at Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) — reported third-quarter earnings and revenue well above Wall Street estimates.

826,L,"The WikiLeaks email trove is revealing more than the servility of ""objective"" reporters trying to please Hillary Clinton and her aides. It's revealing the press strategy of Clinton and her aides — how they seek to praise reporters, even as they arrogantly stonewall them.One internal campaign email exchange is salient. It discusses Clinton speaking at a Syracuse University event for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, which is so named for the deceased liberal New York Times political correspondent Robin Toner. Clinton had been invited as a keynote speaker.Her aides discuss how she should try to please the journalists she'd been ignoring by mocking her tendency to avoid journalistic scrutiny. Press secretary Nick Merrill liked the draft of jokes that was sent around as a strategy that never surrenders, saying, ""What I liked about it is that it provided a rare opportunity for her to show some contrition and self-awareness but do it under the guise of humor so as not to cede any ground.""The Clintons never cede any ground and never relinquish their Kung-Fu grip on their own narrative and imagery. ""Guise of humor?"" Their contempt for their friends is astounding. The media may not like this, but it doesn't stop their never-ending cooperation, hence the contempt.Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri proposed that they ""pretend everyone in the audience is a serious, on the level journalist trying to get the story right and cover serious issues in an absurdly difficult environment where speed and mass appeal are over valued.""And she scripted the rest of the media-pandering approach: ""Have her commend them on how hard they all work in this difficult environment to tell the facts, unearth important stories ... if (Clinton) acknowledges that and says she and all thoughtful people appreciate the struggle the reporters in the room face, and how (important) it is that they keep at it, how needed they really are -- (I) think that would go over really well.""Clinton did exactly that. First, she admitted she was a control freak with the press, saying, ""My relationship with the press has been at times, shall we say, complicated."" And she proclaimed: ""I am all about new beginnings: a new grandchild, another new hairstyle, a new email account. Why not a new relationship with the press? So here goes. No more secrecy. No more zone of privacy."" She joked that they all had a nondisclosure agreement from her lawyer under their chairs.Clinton slathered on praise. ""You are facing fundamental questions that may not fit into 140 characters but are nonetheless vital to our democracy,"" she said. ""Too many of our most important debates occur in what I call an evidence-free zone, ideology trumping facts, made-for-cable shoutfests, Twitter storms, drowning out substantive dialogue and reporting that often leads to shallower more contentious politics and even no, or not the best, public policy.""Clinton closed her remarks with a pitch for the media elite. ""We need, more than ever, smart, fair-minded journalists to challenge our assumptions, push us toward new solutions and hold all of us accountable,"" she said.The result? A standing ovation.Never mind that the Clintons resist at every turn any halfhearted efforts to hold them accountable for all of their scandalous behavior. The only journalism they really respect is the ""journalism"" that rips their enemies apart or blatantly promotes them as they dishonestly see themselves — as incredibly smart and compassionate public servants with no moral flaws worth noticing.

827,L,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""

829,L,"Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and KKR are among buyout firms in talks with banks for financing to back their bids for Valeant Pharmaceutical International's Australian drug unit, people with knowledge of the matter said.Indicative bids for Valeant's (VRX) iNova Pharmaceuticals business were submitted this month, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to speak publicly. The sale may fetch about $773 million in U.S. currency, the people said.Valeant is selling iNova after a tumultuous period when its stock price plummeted 90% over 15 months amid outrage over skyrocketing drug prices and government investigations. Its new management cut the annual profit forecast this week to well below estimates amid declining sales at some of its key prescription businesses and a bleak outlook for its generic unit.Valeant shares surged higher by 5% but lost most of those gains in morning trades. Shares were up fractionally in recent action.An external spokesman for Blackstone (BX) in Sydney said he couldn't immediately comment, while Hong Kong-based spokeswomen for Carlyle (CG) and KKR (KKR) declined to comment. Shares of all three were up roughly 1% in morning trades.Representatives for Valeant couldn't be reached for comment outside regular business hours in Canada.Valeant, based in Laval, Quebec, bought iNova in 2011 from private equity firm Archer Capital for $474 million upfront, with the agreement to pay an additional $57 million when certain milestones were hit. iNova sells and distributes prescription and over-the-counter products including Nyal cough medicine and Difflam sore throat treatments, according to its website.

Closings increased 12.6% to 1,052 homes, and average sales price grew 10.4% to $205,613.

831,L,"Major averages erased early losses and turned higher Tuesday as voters headed to the polls.The final IBD/TIPP presidential tracking poll showed Donald Trump with a 2-point lead over Hillary Clinton — 45% to 43%.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all rose 0.3% after previously falling by about that amount. Early volume data showed turnover on the Nasdaq and NYSE tracking lower than Monday's levels.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq snapped nine-session losing streaks Monday with bullish gains in lower volume. But one day of strength isn't enough to put the market in an uptrend. It still needs to prove itself more.In the stock market today, shares of Tesla (TSLA) erased early losses to rally 1.6% after the company announced plans to acquire German firm Grohmann to enhance its automated manufacturing systems. Terms weren't disclosed.Priceline (PCLN) soared to an all-time high, rising 6.5%. Late Monday, the company reported a 23% rise in quarterly profit and 19% increase in sales. Management guided Q4 earnings below consensus views, but pointed to 29% growth in room night bookings and announced interim Chief Executive Brett Keller would take over as permanent chief, effective immediately.IBD'S TAKE: The online travel firm was a candidate for an option trade on Monday ahead of the results. The right to buy 100 shares of Priceline at 1482.50 came at a cost of $3,700. Shares were recently trading around 1,571. IBD's option strategy is a way to manage risk around earnings.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index was up 0.2%.While biotech, ship transport, lodging, database software and money center banking stocks led the market's upside, big-cap techs also showed buying demand.Intel (INTC) is making slow yet steady progress since clearing a recent 36.03 flat-base entry. The chipmaking giant, which is riding a buying wave following raised Q3 revenue guidance, rose nearly 0.3% to 37.26, up 3% from the prime buy point. Don't chase a stock more than 5% past the proper buy point -- in Intel's case, 37.83.Apple (AAPL) looked to end a two-day selling slide as shares edged nearly 0.4% higher to 113.97. The biggest U.S. company by market cap is still in buy range following last week's push past a 110.33 bottoming cup-with-handle entry.Also in the stock market today, Fitbit (FIT) is cooling off after last week's hot run, losing almost 1% to 16.07. The 2015 IPO is at a critical juncture, trying to clear stubborn resistance near its falling 200-day moving average. The stock has jogged an impressive 40% higher from its June low of 11.65, placing the stock within eyesight of taking out a 52-week high of 18.85.An aggressive trader could see the recent action as a breakout from a nearly six-week flat base with a 16.04 entry point. The stock rebounded to as high as 16.04 in mid-August, then moved sideways, giving up no more than 10% from the high of the new flat base to the pattern's intraday low of 14.35.A proper flat base shows a decline of no more than 10% to 15% from intraday high to low.Most of Fitbit's proprietary IBD ratings score extremely low due to two main issues: 1) two quarters in a row of falling earnings per share; and 2) the stock's 78% plunge from an August 2015 high of 51.90. However, on the bright side, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a healthy B grade, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. A grade of C+ or higher indicates net institutional buying in the stock over the past 13 weeks.Despite the advance, homebuilders' stock values got sawed following a weaker than expected figure on August U.S. housing starts, down 5.8%. Group leader LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 2% to 35.01, approaching a prior 34.60 buy point within a long cup base. The fast-growing builder of entry-level single-family homes is just one of two companies in IBD's residential building group with a maximum 99 Earnings Per Share Rating.IBD'S TAKE: The flat base often forms as part of the base on base, an excellent chart pattern that numerous great stock market winners form just as they ignite huge price runs.

The Dow Jones industrial average also rose0.1%. Two components that just had good weeks, Apple and Intel, were down in active trading.Apple's 1% drop was no doubt affecting the Nasdaq, which was off 0.1%, also off session lows but far off a 0.7% morning gain. Intel was down 1% also, despite a number of price-target updates by analysts. Both held above their most recent buy points.Volume was tracking lower, something expected after Friday's quadruple witching. The quarterly expiration of options and futures drive up volume sharply.Casino, restaurant and travel stocks were among the day's weakest. Travel and leisure stocks often are sold off after bouts of terrorism. Over the weekend, bombings in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing spree in Minnesota raised terror fears. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) fell back below a 105.79 buy point.WebMD (WBMD) plunged nearly 7% in heavy volume after the company announced it is replacing CEO David J.

Lumentum Holdings (LITE) rose nearly 5% to a new high and Finisar (FNSR) added 2%. Both are extended from buy points.Essent Group (ESNT) made a new high, rising 1.2%.

836,L,"The Clinton Foundation has become a serious problem for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Everyone knows the Clintons made a mockery of the promises they made to Team Obama. Even the left-wing site PolitiFact says that it's ""Mostly False"" that they obeyed the rules.
"
837,L,"Like her husband, Bill Clinton, who infamously claimed, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman,"" Monica Lewinsky, Hillary Clinton is going around claiming, ""My work as secretary of state was not influenced by outside sources.""On Jan. 5, 2009, Clinton sent a letter to State Department Designated Agency Ethics Official James Thessin promising, ""I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on my financial interests or those of any person whose interests are imputed to me,"" including her husband.Who didn't anticipate that this would end up in an ethical mess? What genius hasn't observed over the last 25 years how the Clintons break their promises? Some people saw this as a potential scandal, but they didn't stand a chance with the Clinton-loving press.In Oct. 2007, liberal pundit Matthew Yglesias asked in the Los Angeles Times, ""Who's giving money to Bill Clinton?"" He complained that the Clintons should release a list of their foundation donors before Hillary Clinton could become president in 2009, saying: ""Disclosing who's contributing to Bill Clinton's foundation after his wife wins the election would be about four years too late. The voters ought to have this information before the election, when it could still make a difference.""Surprise, surprise: Clinton didn't win, and the Clintons didn't release a donor list until Dec. 2008, when she was asked to become secretary of state. The blather on the TV networks was all about how President Obama's cabinet was a team of geniuses. ""We have not seen this kind of combination of star power, brain power and political muscle this early in a cabinet in our lifetimes,"" gushed George Stephanopoulos on ABC. The fix was in.As Clinton's four years wound down, the pundits celebrated the wonderful work of the Clinton Foundation. On ""The Chris Matthews Show"" on July 16, 2012, journalist Howard Fineman said that Bill Clinton had modeled his foundation on President Jimmy Carter, but that ""he's Jimmy Carter with a better touch."" Chris Matthews replied: ""And much bigger in terms of the amplification of what he's been able to do. The Clinton Global Initiative is huge. And by the way it's done a lot to build his role in history...beyond anything he was able to do as president.""On Aug. 23, the Associated Press underlined the degree to which Hillary Clinton's promises were vaporized. More than half the people outside the government (at least 85 of 154 people) who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton during the first half of her ""public service"" at the State Department donated to the family foundation. At least 40 donated more than $100,000, and 20 contributed more than $1 million.The AP based these investigations off half of Clinton's office calendars from her State Department tenure, which it only received after filing a Freedom of Information Act request to acquire them. The other half of the calendars won't be released until after the election.Once again, the Clintons are making promises to downsize their involvement with the foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. At this point, that sounds as believable as former Rep. Anthony Weiner's promise to stop texting. But the Clinton-enabling reflex in the media is dangerously strong, and the Clintons are threatening to take advantage of it for the rest of this campaign.

840,L,"On Oct. 16 on his CNN show ""Reliable Sources,"" host Brian Stelter took the denial of liberal media bias to a new level. In the wake of hundreds of emails underlining media-Democrat collusion, he insisted that every American should deny the evidence:""In Trump's world, journalists are really just (Hillary) Clinton campaign workers in disguise, collaborating with her in an attempt to rig the election. This is not just false. It's ludicrous, and it's damaging.""On what planet does this man live? Even by Clinton News Network standards, this is ridiculous.A charge of leftist media bias this election cycle is about as ludicrous as claiming that the sun rises in the east. All these WikiLeaks emails give firsthand evidence of the so-called ""objective"" press acting like badly disguised Clinton campaign workers. If this sort of fraud were illegal, these reporters would be headed for Sing Sing.What's false, ludicrous and damaging to democracy is the idea that this sort of journalistic betrayal is ethical and permissible.Start with this: How can a CNN host so blithely dismiss the compromise of a CNN town hall between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders when Donna Brazile — CNN pundit and professional Democrat — allegedly fed an actual question to the Clinton campaign ahead of time? It doesn't matter whether Brazile grabbed the question from CNN or its partner, the black-oriented cable network TV One. She was a CNN contributor rigging a CNN event.CNN's Jake Tapper called this Brazile scandal journalistically ""horrifying."" Apparently, Stelter thinks his colleague Tapper is false, ludicrous and damaging.If Corey Lewandowski were feeding town-hall questions to Donald Trump, we can guess Stelter would have a heart attack on air.On Stelter's show, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan agreed that this whole liberal-conspiracy theory is ""absurd."" She said, ""Nobody is sitting in a room with each other and planning to, you know, do anything evil to a candidate."" So what do you call the Washington Post publishing the Trump sex-talk tape in six hours, whereas it sat on the Paula Jones story for months? What's absurd is denying that liberal bias is in full corrosive effect.What the WikiLeaks email trove is exposing is how reporters individually pandered and plotted and manipulated Clinton's media coverage. They were at Clinton's beck and call. Unsurprisingly, ABC's George Stephanopoulos harshly interviewed ""Clinton Cash"" author Peter Schweizer on April 26, 2015. In an email, Clinton campaign staffer Jesse Ferguson boasted Stephanopoulos was a perfect servant, saying:  ""Great work everyone. This interview is perfect. (Schweizer) lands nothing and everything is refuted (mostly based on our work).""New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich was allowing Clinton Communications Director Jen Palmieri to pick and choose which Clinton quotes to use in a July article, and which to bury. She listed her vetoes, then imperiously announced: ""Let me know if that is not clear. Working from an iPhone on the plane so am not able to access the transcript to cut and paste.""Why would anyone try to suggest that treating reporters like drive-in carhops on roller skates is professional journalism in action? Why would anyone deny the irrefutably obvious?There's an easy guess: because WikiLeaks is exposing the media-Democrat collusion that is utterly routine in every election cycle. The Brian Stelters don't want to admit there's anything sleazy about this. Are they doing their part to rig the elections in favor of the Democrats? Of course, they are. Lord knows we don't want those poor, uneducated, easy-to-command types to carry the day.

843,L,"We once scoffed at the suggestion there was some form of a liberal media conspiracy against conservatives. Do liberals meet for breakfast and plan attacks on their ideological foes? Of course not, we'd answer. It's not a conspiracy. It's a mindset wherein what is liberal is good, and what is conservative is in opposition to what is good.Apparently it was a conspiracy after all. The latest emails emerging from WikiLeaks have brought in the evidence. There is an unquestionable collusion between ""objective"" journalists and the Clinton campaign. Leaked emails show that her operatives discuss which reporters were the most pliant recyclers of their narratives (they picked Maggie Haberman of The New York Times). But reporter Mark Leibovich -- also from the Times -- gave Clinton's communications director, Jen Palmieri, veto power over quotes to be included in a Clinton profile in July.It's not just WikiLeaks that has provided numerous other examples documenting the inseparable nature of the Clinton-media relationship. What TMZ has reported on the Trump tape with the shameless sex banter is far more telling. An article published by TMZ staff said: ""Multiple sources connected with NBC tell us ... top network execs knew about the video long before they publicly said they did, but wanted to hold it because it was too early in the election. The sources say many NBC execs have open disdain for Trump and their plan was to roll out the tape 48 hours before the debate so it would dominate the news cycle leading up to the face-off.""In this election, it's now documented fact that ""newsgathering"" was not the goal of the architects of our top newspapers and newscasts. Rather, it was victory for the Democrats.It's time these propagandists stop calling themselves the ""news"" media. They have lost credibility with the public as referees or watchdogs or anything remotely approaching objectivity. Their approval rating is at an all-time low, according to the latest Gallup Poll. That's because their dishonest political aggression is at an all-time high.After Donald Trump half-joked during the second debate that with a different Justice Department Clinton would be in jail, the media bigwigs ranted and wailed that Trump sounded like Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler or a garden-variety tin-pot dictator. But how on Earth do the media believe they have the right to pass judgment on these things, given their assault on the democratic process?This onslaught of timed and designed Republican-destroying stories -- and the funereal tone that accompanies and magnifies it all --  is  a media conspiracy to end the election, and end it now. They want conventional wisdom to harden that Trump is toast. Next on the agenda: Take out the Republican majority in Congress.After smearing Bill Clinton's female accusers for decades, denouncing them for trafficking in lies and tabloidish ""toxic waste,"" The New York Times is championing two women who accuse Trump of sexual harassment. Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told CNNMoney, ""I think it is pretty evident this story falls clearly in the realm of public service journalism.""This is because the partisan hacks like Baquet define a ""public service"" as anything that advances the liberal agenda. The fix is in. This isn't a horse race. They're beating a horse to death.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center.

844,L,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

The press' moral outrage was as phony as Hillary Clinton's. ""This is horrific,"" Clinton shamelessly tweeted. ""We cannot allow this man to become president.""The women who were actually harassed by Bill Clinton were never offered any support from Hillary Clinton, or her feminist army in the press. In February of 1994, Paula Jones held a press conference to accuse Bill Clinton of exposing himself and requesting oral sex in a hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas. Other than 16 seconds on ABC, the media decided that wasn't news ... until Jones filed a lawsuit and the Clintons hired a lawyer three months later.But the Jones case vanished from the press and played no significant role in the 1996 presidential campaign. There were 11 network stories during the entire election year. Half of them were perfunctory notices of legal claims, and the other half focused on the Republican National Committee making an ad mocking Bill Clinton for claiming that he couldn't be sued because he was on ""active duty"" as commander-in-chief. Once Clinton was safely re-elected, a few establishment media outlets decided that maybe there was something to this Jones thing.The lawsuit eventually led to the deposition of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, so the story became a huge, national nightmare -- in part because both Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed for months that Lewinsky was lying. When the story broke, Hillary Clinton even said on ABC that Lewinsky misunderstood that Bill Clinton is just ""a happy, friendly, loving, kind, good person."" He ""reaches out to all kinds of people.""ABC enabled that. No laugh track. No skepticism. It was gullible to a fault.The emergence of Lewinsky led to other women who said that Clinton assaulted them. In March of 1998, Ed Bradley interviewed Kathleen Willey on CBS ""60 Minutes."" Willey said the president fondled her breast and put her hand on his crotch during a 1993 Oval Office visit. Willey had been begging for a job. The Clinton team quickly put out letters Willey had written Clinton to erase the idea that she was assaulted, and the story vanished. A federal judge ruled in 2000 that the Clinton White House violated the Privacy Act with that disclosure. The Big Three TV networks gave that ruling 66 seconds combined.This pattern was even repeated with Juanita Broaddrick, who declared in a ""Dateline NBC"" interview in 1999 that Clinton raped her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1978 (""You better get some ice for that,"" he told her after). On the evening newscasts, CBS aired one story, and ABC and NBC did nothing -- even though NBC secured the interview!When Trump invited these women to the second presidential debate, guess what the networks did.

848,L,"On Oct. 2, The New York Times published an admittedly ""fragmentary"" front-page story about Donald Trump's taxes. Just three pages were cited: the first page of the state tax returns Trump filed in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in 1995.The Times reported that Trump claimed a $916 million loss, which could -- emphasis on ""could"" -- have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for ""up to 18 years."" The story was stuffed with speculation about what Trump may have potentially done.The Times was typically harsh in tone. The tax records ""reveal the extraordinary tax benefits that Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, derived from the financial wreckage he left behind"" with his financial ""mismanagement.""A tax expert declared that Trump ""has a vast benefit from his destruction"" in the early 1990s, like he was Hurricane Donald.What could be true might well be true. But when did idle speculation become a prestigious form of journalism? The political imperative to destroy this man is inescapable.Everything the Times reports on Trump ought to require a mental disclaimer. It has vowed to expose Trump as a dangerously unbalanced man who is not a role model for our children. (Apparently the Clintons are role models.) It has blurred any difference between the news pages and editorial pages by openly declaring how Trump ""lies"" on the front page.The Times said that Hillary Clinton, by contrast, was only guilty of a ""penchant for privacy"" when her team lied and said she was merely ""overheated"" when she collapsed into a van.This is the same newspaper that published a front-page editorial by Jim Rutenberg in which he argued that a crusade against Trump is necessary and fairness is a trap.He said: ""Journalism shouldn't measure itself against any one campaign's definition of fairness. It is journalism's job to be true to the readers and viewers, and true to the facts, in a way that will stand up to history's judgment.""At a Harvard panel discussion, Times editor Dean Baquet insisted he would risk jail time to expose Trump on taxes. And he would also tell his lawyers that Trump's tax records must be revealed because his ""whole campaign is built on his success as a businessman and his wealth.""But do we really need tax returns to know Trump had some business failures and bankruptcy filings and then turned his empire around?Employing a Baquet standard -- the basis of a candidate's appeal is the most urgent subject matter for investigation -- why then wouldn't the Times risk it all to expose feminist Clinton's mistreatment of women, especially the women who accused her husband of sexual misconduct?What about those destroyed emails? Benghazi? The Clinton Foundation? Where's the zeal these last few weeks to drill down, or even drill toward, the truth?Instead, the Times just published a story on Oct. 3 headlined, ""Her Husband Accused of Affairs, a Defiant Clinton Fought Back."" Inside, the headline was ""A Defiant Clinton Fought Infidelity Claims."" Two words were missing: ""With Lies."" Reporter Megan Twohey displayed all the investigative aggression of Gomer Pyle.This was the Times' summary of Clinton's ""bimbo""-patrol involvement: ""Mrs. Clinton's level of involvement in that effort, as described in interviews, internal campaign records and archives, is still the subject of debate. By some accounts, she gave the green light and was a motivating force; by others, her support was no more than tacit assent.""Times columnist Maureen Dowd at least quoted the memoir of George Stephanopoulos, saying, ""She had to do what she had always done before: swallow her doubts, stand by her man and savage his enemies.""Or let The New York Times do it instead.

852,L,"Stocks were narrowly mixed Thursday afternoon amid another round of earnings reports. American Express (AXP) led the upside but Tractor Supply (TSCO) fell hard again, keeping its sharp downtrend intact.The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a small gain, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell fractionally. Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq but a touch lower on the NYSE. AmEx, part of the Dow, vaulted more than 10% to aid the blue chip average's cause.AmEx is trying to stop a downtrend that has lasted nearly two years. In late 2014, the charge account firm failed in an attempt to clear a saucer with handle base with a 92.69 pivot point. The large cap then proceeded to fall as much as 48% below its all-time peak of 96.24. But now shares are back above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.Aggressive traders may buy the stock if it surpasses 67.44, 10 cents above the April 21 peak.IBD'S TAKE: Do you know how to identify stocks that have bottomed out after a big price slide and may be breaking out? Read this Investor's Corner column to determine stocks that are turning around and potentially becoming new big winners.Among retailing stocks, Tractor Supply (TSCO) slid 4.5% to 64.33 in volume running nearly five times its usual level. The stock's 50-day average turnover is 1.98 million shares.Notice on a weekly chart how the former big winner and specialist in farm, pet and ranching products dived 19% in the week ended Sept. 9 in wild volume following news that it gave a sour outlook on same-store sales for the third quarter. Over the next five weeks, the stock made no attempt to recover, instead trading in a tight sideways range.Such action formed what IBD calls the L-shape pattern, a timely tool to help short sellers add to their winning positions.In Tractor Supply's case, one could have sold shares short on Oct. 17 when the stock took out the recent low of 66.43. As always, one must cut losses short at 7%-8% or less. But in this case, Tractor did not rally to force sellers to cover.Late Wednesday, Tractor posted a 5% increase in both earnings per share and sales; net margin dipped slightly to 5.8%.Elsewhere in the stock market today, HealthEquity (HQY) cooled off, falling 3% to 35.63 as it priced a follow-on offering, but is holding above its rising 50-day line. The HSA (health savings accounts) administrator has been in a sharp uptrend since breaking out past a 31.79 buy point in a nine-month cup with handle.NVR Inc. (NVR) got trampled by sellers as the luxury homebuilder fell nearly 4% to 1,556 in massive trading. An early-July breakout past a flat base at 1,820.10 failed, and the stock is now 14% off that peak.NVR reported a 5% bump up in Q3 earnings, down sharply from 31% growth in the year-ago quarter, as sales rose 10% to $1.54 billion. Both EPS and revenue missed views. It was the slowest top-line increase in seven quarters. Net margin slipped to 7.6%, down 70 basis points.RELATED:What Is The L-Shape Pattern?How Can I Quickly Get Started In The Art Of Short Selling?Which Companies Join HealthEquity As Elite Growth Names In Terms Of FY 2017 Earnings Estimates?Could AmEx Be Forming The Bottoming Base Pattern?

853,L,"Builders broke ground on an annualized 1.047 million homes in September, down 9% to the slowest pace since March 2015, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning.Economists had expected a slight increase to a 1.18 million pace after tumbling a revised 5.6% in August. But that was all due to volatile multifamily starts. Single-family starts jumped 8.1% in September to the highest since February.Building permits, a gauge of future activity, climbed 6.3% to a 1.225 million pace, the highest since November 2015.On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported its builder sentiment gauge fell 2 points to 63 in October but was better than expected and near September's recent peak.IBD'S TAKE: Housing stocks have been falling as mortgage rates rise. A key reason is that investors are starting to believe the Fed will raise rates soon.Homebuilder stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks as the rise in bond yields around the world pushes up mortgage rates. They were little changed before the opening bell on the stock market today.LGI Homes (LGIH), which broke below its 50-day moving average earlier this month, edged 0.5% higher on Tuesday amid the NAHB index and a general market rally.KB Home (KBH), which has held up in a flat base consolidation, fell fractionally Tuesday. KB Home on Wednesday released 2017 and 2019 financial targets. It sees 2017 revenue of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion and expects 2019 revenue of about $5 billion.D.R. Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) also rose modestly Tuesday.
"
854,L,"U.S. stocks stayed within the previous day's trading range midday Tuesday, as volume picked up the pace a bit.The Nasdaq tested its 50-day moving average line as the tech-leaning index sank 1.2%. The S&P 500 remained below its 50-day line, down 1.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking slightly higher than Monday's pace.Blue chips in the Dow were down with one notable exception. Apple (AAPL) gapped up 2.5% in volume 200% above average. Shares rallied on positive iPhone 7 orders from wireless carrier Sprint (S), which said that preorders in the first three days were quadruple vs. the same time a year ago. The move took back Apple's short-term 10-day line, only a day after Apple bounced off its nearly merged 50-day and 200-day moving average lines.Apple's chart is on the sloppy side, but a 110.33 buy point in a handle remains a potential entry. Is there an earlier entry? The bounce off the 50-day line is a possibility for the aggressive trader, especially since that nearly matches older resistance at 101.89. Yet, with the market uptrend under pressure, many disciplined investors are probably keeping their aggressive side in check. Breakouts work best when the overall market is providing a tailwind.Also, Apple's lost its aggressive growth profile. The Street expects earnings to fall 10% in fiscal 2016 ending in September, and then rebound 8% in fiscal 2017.Among top-rated stocks, few were resisting Tuesday's headwinds.Telecom play Acacia Communications (ACIA) fell 5% in brisk volume but stayed within a high-tight flag pattern.Texas-based homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) slid 3%, but trade was soft.India-based HDFC Bank (HDB) fell 2% as it headed toward its fifth daily loss in a row. The stock is approaching its 50-day line. Weekly volume on the decline has been below average, a positive development should the stock bounce off the 50-day line in strong volume. Such action would provide a secondary buy zone.On the upside, China-based online game provider NetEase (NTES) rose 4.5% and then reversed to a 0.7% gain.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, all except a handful were down. Oil stocks were among the hard-hit issues. West Texas intermediate crude oil fell almost 3% to just under $45 a barrel on a forecast of weak demand.
"
855,L,"More than a decade ago, in an effort to decrease imports, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance America's energy security, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Among other provisions, this legislation created a national Renewable Fuel Standard mandating the blending of renewable fuels -- such as ethanol -- into gasoline and diesel.Each year, the Environmental Protection Agency sets a blending target for ethanol production. For example, in 2010 the EPA directed that 12.9 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into gasoline and diesel.By 2016, the amount had jumped to 18.1 billion gallons, and the proposed requirement for 2017 is 18.8 billion gallons. Since the law was passed, ethanol's share of the U.S. gasoline mix has increased from less than 3% to nearly 10%.As with many public policies, the ""law of unintended consequences"" has come into play with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Oil refiners and importers, who are the ""obligated parties"" under the law, often have to buy credits, in order to comply with their blending requirements.But the price of these credits has jumped markedly over the past year and is projected to cost refiners and importers more than $2 billion in 2016, further depressing the profitability of many companies that are currently struggling with a global glut of gasoline and diesel.For example, the S&P 1500 index of refining and marketing companies has fallen 18% so far this year, while the broader market is up about 7%. Jack Lipinski, chief executive of CVR Refining, recently stated that the credits ""continue to be an egregious tax on our business and have become our single largest operating expense.""Should the blending requirement be increased by 700,000 million gallons next year, as currently proposed, the situation for many refiners and importers will only worsen.The automobile industry also isn't happy about the proposed hike in the blending mandate. Research has shown that blends above 10% can damage car engines and fuel systems for millions of vehicles on the road today. Indeed, the industry has stated that some warranties won't be honored if damage occurs from using a fuel blend greater than that for which the vehicle was designed.What's more, it's not clear the ethanol mandate has achieved its intended goals. True, oil imports have dropped dramatically over the past eight years, from 60% of consumption to less than 35%, but the credit goes to the shale revolution that has dramatically boosted domestic production, not the ethanol mandate.In terms of greenhouse gas reduction, even the Environmental Protection Agency admits there is little benefit from the mandate, since making ethanol requires clearing forests and grasslands that could otherwise sequester carbon emissions.Ethanol production has also driven up water costs and the prices of feed and food. Growing enough corn to yield one gasoline-equivalent gallon of ethanol requires 2,700 gallons of water, while the refining process requires another three to six gallons. Because half the nation's corn production is now being refined into ethanol, consumers are paying higher prices for beef, milk, poultry and pork.Recently, the environmental community has started to question the benefits of the ethanol mandate, citing higher-than-expected carbon emissions, fertilizer runoff, and reduced wildlife habitat.  Even the National Resources Defense Council, which lobbied strongly for the Renewable Fuel Standard, has now concluded that ""the bulk of today's conventional corn ethanol carries grave risks to the climate, wildlife, waterways and food security.""Many environmental groups, along with oil refiners and importers, are now calling for a complete revamp of the program. Not surprisingly, corn growers and ethanol manufacturers want to see the mandate increased and will resist any efforts to repeal or modify the program.But special interests aside, the economic benefits to businesses and consumers from repeal or modification of the Renewable Fuel Standard will far outweigh any costs to farmers, who are currently enjoying record profits, while helping to keep gasoline and diesel prices at their current levels.

856,L,"Election 2016: Donald Trump has been roundly rebuked and openly reviled for saying during Wednesday night's debate that he might not ""respect"" the results of the election if it is fraudulent. But Hillary Clinton is the last person who should be criticizing him.Real or not, Trump seems to have a major grievance. ""Remember, we are competing in a rigged election,"" Trump told a Wisconsin rally Monday night. ""They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.""Then, when Trump suggested he might not accept the election results on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton was ready to strike back. ""We've been around for 240 years,"" Hillary said, punching hard. ""We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.""She called Trump's response ""horrifying"" and castigated him for ""denigrating our democracy."" Imagine!This was almost universally applauded, even by some Republicans. But the idea that we've always had ""free and fair"" elections isn't entirely true. More to the point, our presidential elections haven't always been pristine. Far from it.IBD'S TAKE: For daily updates on the presidential race, including the latest tracking poll information and demographic breakdowns of results, follow the IBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll.As historian and author Stephen L. Carter notes, the 1800 election that gave us Thomas Jefferson as president was marred by claims from supporters of Aaron Burr that Jefferson had cheated. At the time, the person who finished second in the balloting became vice president. In 1804, Burr's final year as vice president, things became so fraught between the two sides of the political debate that Burr killed his main political antagonist, Alexander Hamilton, in a duel.In 1824, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson fought bitterly to win the White House, and after a deadlock, the election became the first to be thrown into the House of Representatives. Jackson won the presidency four years later, after decrying the ""corrupt bargain"" that Adams made with House Speaker Henry Clay in 1824 to gain the presidency.Take 1876, when Samuel L. Tilden beat Rutherford B. Hayes in the popular vote. But neither won the Electoral College outright. So a deal was struck: Democrats agreed to abandon their candidate, Tilden, in favor of the Republican Hayes, if the incoming president would promise to withdraw troops from the post-Reconstruction South. That deal is still considered questionable in terms of its legality by many scholars.In 1960, there were what voting analysts today like to call ""massive irregularities"" in the vote counts of mob-run Chicago, West Virginia and LBJ's Texas that favored one candidate: John F. Kennedy. Despite feeling he had been cheated of the presidency, Richard M. Nixon, a man who has been miscast as a misanthropic paranoid, refused to challenge the cheating out of concern for what it would do to the country.The point is, U.S. elections have never been all that clean. As the saying goes, it ain't beanbag. But the loser has usually conceded in the end.That Hillary would now denounce Trump for suggesting he might not respect the results is a joke. It shows her utter shamelessness.In Wednesday night's debate, she made out like she was Joan of Arc on the debate stage, a defender of ""free and fair"" elections and the idea that once done, an election is over — finished.But we all know what happened in 2000. Democrats contested the outcome of the Florida vote, which showed George W. Bush with a slender win over Al Gore — giving him just enough electoral votes to win the presidency. After initially conceding defeat, Gore recanted and spent weeks challenging the results. The election left the country politically divided and angry.Later, vote recounts and investigations by no fewer than five separate left-leaning media groups found that, under most rules for recounting ballots — including the broad recount standard that Al Gore had favored — George W. Bush had won the Florida election.Did Hillary and other Democrats meekly concede and recede into the political woodwork? Hardly.The left-leaning media continue to push the idea that the 2000 election was stolen. A headline in a 2012 issue of the New Yorker is a case in point: ""Yes, Bush v. Gore Did Steal the Election.""Hillary has perpetuated this lie for nearly two decades.In a 2002 video, she tells a political fundraiser in Los Angeles that Bush was ""selected,"" not ""elected"" -- implying he was illegitimate.In 2009, while secretary of state, Clinton told a town-hall meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, that the U.S.' democracy wasn't perfect. ""In 2000, our presidential election came down to one state where the brother of the man running for president was the governor of the state, so I mean, we have our problems too,"" she said. ""But we have been moving to try to remedy those problems as we see them.""And just last week, as Al Gore stepped up to campaign for Hillary, she could be seen smiling and nodding in agreement on the stage as a group of supporters chanted at Gore ""You won! You won!"" after Gore suggested he was cheated out of the presidency.So spare us the sanctimony. Modern Democrats have taken a page out of their bible, leftist Saul Alinsky's book ""Rules For Radicals."" From it, they've learned to use dirty tricks and lies to delegitimize and weaken their political foes. Hillary, a follower and doting admirer of Alinsky and his nasty tactics, is only doing what comes naturally.RELATED:Nationalizing U.S. Elections — Obama's Most Dangerous Idea?Hillary Email Scandal ExplainedClinton Foundation Scandal

857,L,"Retail can be a choppy sector, but beauty-specific shops like Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH's Sephora are flying much higher than their retail peers.For proof, look no further than Ulta's routine double-digit same-store sales growth vs. Gap's (GPS) string of negative comps. Analysts say cosmetics is a $14 billion retail market in the U.S. One researcher, Euromonitor, pegs the overall U.S. beauty market by retail sales — including color cosmetics, skin care and fragrance — at more than $37 billion.So if beauty is such a hot industry, does that necessarily make newbie ""fast-fashion"" cosmetics brand e.l.f.

Reception has generally been positive; the stock received an outperform from both Cowen and William Blair, plus an overweight from Piper Jaffray.William Blair analyst Jon Andersen cited e.l.f's growth opportunity amid the strength of the cosmetics market, plus its solid supply chain and appeal to millennials and multicultural consumers.Andersen wrote in his note: ""The quantity and quality of online product reviews are indicative of a passionate user base; and brand sales productivity is top of peer set at key national retailer accounts.""A separate report from Piper Jaffray's Stephanie Wissink echoed the sentiment that the brand resonates with younger shoppers.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at Amazon's struggle to elbow out specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and Sephora, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""""This digitally native consumer has depended on agile brands to democratize high fashion and we see similar behavioral indicators in beauty,"" she wrote.

"
859,L,"The media coverage of the presidential race is so tilted to the Democrats that even liberal analysts feel obliged to declare it. USA Today media columnist Michael Wolff asserted that this campaign isn't between Trump and Clinton. It's between Trump and the media that have turned against him in a big way.During the Republican primaries they were initially bemused, and then they acknowledged Trump as a serious populist challenge to the status quo. Their coverage wasn't positive, but it was voluminous, crowding out everyone else. He hit back, and they let him, marveling at his brass knuckles. The media aimed to drive a serious wedge into the conservative base of the GOP, and they succeeded.But as Wolff writes, ""Now, appalled by their own creation, the media have become, with quite some religious fervor, the defender of truth, justice, morality and proper public behavior, all focused on (Trump's) undoing."" As a result, ""Clinton will walk into the White House having faced the least amount of scrutiny, criticism and antipathy of any major-party nominee in modern media history.""One could argue that Wolff missed the Barack Obama Swoon of 2008, but there was a big difference. Obama was a presidential rookie with little time on the national stage. There are over 20 years of Clinton in positions of national power (including first lady) to evaluate.But here we go again. This rerun was entirely predictable. The TV networks are pretending all Clinton scandals are ancient and dreadfully boring. Instead, her experience is presented as an enormous plus compared to that billionaire ruffian.The media shamelessly proclaim that they are working for a disastrous Trump loss. The New York Times put its own media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, on the front page sounding the battle cry, insisting that Trump is a dangerous demagogue with a deeply racist message and that he must be stopped so the media can stand tall in ""history's judgment.""Here's where Wolff goes off the tracks. He asks, ""Once Trump is dispatched, how does the media, suddenly realizing they did her work, regard (Clinton)?"" Wolff answers his question thusly: ""The media seek to claim as much power as they can. In creating Trump and destroying him, they have found a new certainty and authority. This enhanced power and uninhibited sense of outrage and virtue are sure to elect Clinton (and) then, of course, (to) viciously turn on her.""Nonsense. That theory only makes sense if you're Hillary Clinton, who always imagines that the press despises her. If the press really hated her, could she go nine months without a news conference? Obama's been the worst president in history in prosecuting reporters. Has he suffered consequences? They have no ""uninhibited sense of outrage and virtue."" With Democrats, they abandon any professional self-respect.Like Team Obama, Hillary & Co. claims she's done hundreds of individual interviews, so who needs a news conference? When left to themselves, liberal journalists can't get beyond pleasantries. But put them together in a room and they might start to feel obligated to ask questions tougher than ""How do you feel?"" and ""What will you eventually tell your grandchildren about today?""On scandals like her private email server, Clinton keeps unloading major whoppers, like telling the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell told her to set up the private server. Even Powell, who has endorsed Obama twice, is shaking his head at this blame game.Accountability? Transparency? These aren't watchwords for the left. They are only used as nice-sounding buzzwords to tear Republicans down.How will they view Clinton if she's elected? As a triumph of ""history.""
"
860,L,"Given the choice between undergoing eye surgery or simply squeezing a few drops of solution into your eye every day, picking the latter might seem like a no-brainer for people suffering from mild to moderate glaucoma — why let someone cut into your eyeball when you can stick with the drops?But up to 50% of those affected by the eye disease don't use the medication necessary to stave off its debilitating effects, experts say. Age and forgetfulness play a role in compliance, and the creeping, often symptomless nature of the affliction means eyesight is stolen slowly but irreparably. Left untreated, glaucoma can result in optic-nerve damage and ultimately, blindness.That's where Glaukos (GKOS) comes in. It started trading publicly in June 2015 and has become the first to develop an option that lies somewhere between eye drops and an invasive operation, with a procedure known as micro-invasive glaucoma surgery, or MIGS.Based in Laguna Hills, Calif., Glaukos makes the iStent, a tiny L-shaped titanium device that spans just 1 mm long and 0.3 mm wide — barely as big as the number ""2"" in the ""2016"" on a copper penny. It's the company's only commercially available product thus far.The jagged, tubelike implant drains fluid from the front of the eye, helping to ease the intraocular pressure that can impact vision. Until recently, it was the only FDA-approved MIGS device, having gotten the regulatory nod in 2012.There are caveats. In the U.S., the iStent is only approved for use during cataract surgery. And it is used only in mild-to-moderate cases of what is known as open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of the condition in which symptoms are slow to develop.But within that segment, it dominates.Dr. Alena Reznik, a glaucoma specialist and assistant professor of clinical ophthalmology at the USC Roski Eye Institute, told Investor's Business Daily that for patients with ""visually significant"" cataracts and mild-to-moderate glaucoma who are on drop medication, she would recommend the iStent ""100%"" of the time. She has no affiliation with Glaukos.Drops can be expensive, she said. Plus, a permanent implant can help those who are already on a cocktail of prescriptions to be relieved of one more thing to remember.Out of the 40 or so procedures she performs in a typical month, Reznik says around 10 to 15 of those are iStent implantations.The disease impacts over 3 million Americans, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. Traditional glaucoma surgeries like trabeculectomy and tube shunts are more invasive and can have more side effects, such as bleeding and retinal detachment, said Dr. Reznik. She said she would consider those surgical options only for advanced cases while the iStent, by contrast, has ""extremely low side effects.""Wall Street analysts agree that the iStent is, for now, peerless.""As far as device implantations, for the mild-to-moderate glaucoma (segment) there's really nobody on the market on the MIGS space,"" William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein told IBD. Referring to Glaukos, he added, ""It's a space they have pioneered.""Weinstein and other analysts see the total addressable market opportunity for Glaukos at more than 700,000 procedures annually in the U.S. At last count, Glaukos had a hand in fewer than 100,000 procedures as of mid-2015.Analysts say that virtually all, if not all, iStent procedures are reimbursed by insurance, with Medicare paying for more than 70% of the procedures.At the start of August, Glaukos topped Street estimates and raised guidance in what Weinstein noted was a ""wrecking ball quarter"" fueled by ""both increased utilization and conversion of high volume practices, while average selling prices remain strong.""IBD's TAKE: Glaukos isn't the only new issue investors are keeping an eye on.

The company missed out on a significant gain Friday when the market stumbled, keeping gains to 1%. But Glaukos took advantage of Monday's recovery and shares jumped more than 5% to end the day at 33.68.Glaukos' raised guidance is still ""quite conservative,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Matt O'Brien, who rates the stock as overweight. ""Despite the considerable move in the name and premium valuation, we continue to believe this is one of the most unique assets in all of med tech and continue to recommend purchase.""One of the foreseeable obstacles for Glaukos' headlining product, however, is recent entrant CyPass Micro-Stent. It's a similar device with a similar usage, though it accesses a different space in the eye. Its maker, Transcend Medical, was acquired in February by Novartis (NVS)-subsidiary Alcon.Having just received FDA approval in late July, CyPass is well behind first-mover iStent. And parent company Alcon still needs to sort out its reimbursement situation.Glaukos is using its lead to build out a greater portfolio of products, including the two-stent iStent Inject, the iStent Supra — which accesses the same part of the eye as the Micro-Stent — and the iDose medication-delivery system, the latter of which is several years away. The iDose functions a bit like a plant-watering globe, allowing for a slow-release drip of medication into the eye, once implanted.During its Aug. 1 earnings call, management said it is seeking FDA approval for two versions of its new iStent Inject, with follow-up data on one version coming in mid-2017.Glaukos Chief Executive Thomas Burns said he anticipates that iStent Inject will ""dominate the landscape.""The race to market between CyPass and iStent Inject could get heated, depending on how things shake out.""When I think about (Glaukos') stock, that's an interesting dynamic,"" said Stifel analyst Jonathan Block. ""Does Alcon get (Medicare) reimbursement soon enough to cause some disruption in market share in the next 12-18 months?""Or, looking a year ahead, he said, will Alcon still be fighting for reimbursement while the iStent Inject easily passes regulatory hurdles on its way to entering the market?""Can '17 be noisy or not?"" asked Block.For her part, Dr. Reznik said CyPass ""works very well,"" but that she would reserve use of the device for ""later in the game"" on more advanced cases, and hopes that it will be approved as a stand-alone procedure. She also noted that CyPass is a more difficult procedure — that limits its usage by a broader range of physicians.According to a recent Stifel survey of 98 doctors, about 85% trained in iStent implantations intend to get CyPass training.Stifel's Block is more cautious in his outlook for Glaukos, rating the company a hold, amid the possible headwinds posed by CyPass and reimbursements.But most analysts are bullish on the stock, rating it overweight or buy. William Blair's Weinstein highlighted in a post-earnings report Glaukos' ""healthy"" gross margins and the iStent's adoption rate.""In addition,"" he wrote in August, ""the market for micro-invasive glaucoma surgery remains barely penetrated today and we believe should provide extremely fertile ground for several companies to compete in for many, many years to come.""

862,L,"U.S. stock indexes showed a one-word vocabulary Friday afternoon, and the word was ""sell.""Few stocks escaped damage in the stock market today as losers overwhelmingly led winners. Virtually every index was down.The major averages closed near session lows. The Nasdaq fell 2.5%, the S&P 500 lost about 2.4% while the Dow Jones industrial average sank 3.1% -- all dropping below their 50-day moving averages. The small cap Russell 2000 plunged 2.7%. Volume was running higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.Comments from two Federal Reserve officials slathered gloom on the bulls who have grown to rely on low interest rates. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said he favored ""gradual normalization"" of rates, which the Street interpreted as a rate hike either as early as next week or as late as December. Rosengren is a voting member of the Fed.Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, a nonvoting member, said the case for a rate hike has strengthened.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top stocks, virtually every stock was down. Many of the losers were moving in bearishly strong volume. Stocks dropping under their 50-day moving average line included Broadcom (AVGO), A.O. Smith (AOS), and CyberArk Software (CYBR).Other leading stocks lost their short term 10-day line, including Acacia (ACIA), LGI Homes (LGIH), Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT), Align Technology (ALGN), Nvidia (NVDA), Momo (MOMO), Weibo (WB), TPI Composites (TPIC) and Sina (SINA). Short-term traders often use the 10-day line, or something near it, as a place to exit when the line is violated.Blue chips were down without exception in the Dow. Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA), Verizon (VZ) and Coca-Cola (KO) all lost 3%.
"
863,L,"Washington Post reporter Callum Borchers should win some kind of award for the worst pre-debate spin. He tried to defend NBC anchor and presidential debate host Lester Holt: ""It turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.""Right after the debate, despite all evidence, the Post's Chris Cillizza doubled down, saying: ""Want a testament to how well Holt did? I guarantee you no one is talking about him tomorrow. That's a win.""That is precisely as the press would want this. But that's not what America saw. Holt's performance was a partisan disgrace. Holt asked Donald Trump about his taxes, and then challenged him on his answer. He asked Trump about stop-and-frisk policies, and then challenged him, stating it was ruled unconstitutional, which it wasn't, thus conjuring visions of the Candy Crowley Ghost of Flubbing Debate Moderators Past. He asked Trump about the birther issue, and then challenged him on his answer. He asked him about Iraq, and then interrupted and challenged him five different times.What about Hillary Clinton? There was not one single challenge to anything she said, not one tough question about any policy or any controversy, be it Benghazi, the Clinton Foundation, her medical records or her emails — unless you want to count when Holt politely suggested: ""(Trump) also raised the issue of your emails. Do you want to respond to that?""The Rasmussen Reports poll that came out just before the debate showed that based on the historical record, 46% of Americans believe most moderators will tilt the debates in favor of Clinton. Only 6% think they will try to help Trump. That's an 8-to-1 landslide.
"
864,L,"Holt confirmed the wisdom of the American people.It became obvious that Holt internalized all the howls of outrage from the liberal media against Matt Lauer for being evenhanded with the candidates at the commander-in-chief forum earlier in the month. Editorials were written by anguished staff of both The New York Times and the Washington Post. He might have even heard Jimmy Kimmel rant at ""The Apprentice"" creator Mark Burnett while hosting the Emmy Awards. He said, ""Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don't have to watch reality shows anymore because we're living in one.""Holt's colleagues — and Clinton's campaign — said very publicly that he must go after Trump as a clear and present danger to America. That's exactly what he did.On the morning after this one-sided assault, Holt's colleagues in the liberal media projected an image of him as mellow and reserved, and therefore nonpartisan. The New York Times headline was ""Lester Holt Opted for Restraint."" Reporter Michael Grynbaum began the column saying, ""Call him the minimalist moderator."" He described how Holt ""opted to lie low"" and ""was silent for minutes at a time,"" and then reported that The New Yorker had published a liberal parody called ""CNN Launches Manhunt After Lester Holt Vanishes From Debate.""To stick to its ""minimalist moderator"" spin, the Times chose to ignore most of the debate. Weeks before, Grynbaum wrote an anguished piece after the Lauer forum called ""Matt Lauer Fields Storm of Criticism Over Clinton-Trump Forum."" He even quoted tweets that mangled the facts, such as one from political commentator Norman Ornstein, which said: ""Lauer interrupted Clinton's answers repeatedly to move on. Not once for Trump."" In fact, Lauer interrupted Trump 13 times and Clinton seven times.The only similarity in the stories is that Grynbaum failed to locate an actual conservative or Republican critique of either NBC journalist. That's because the liberal media can't help but slant everything in favor of the left. It's no wonder most Americans no longer trust them.

865,L,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's latest minutes revealed increasing support for an interest-rake hike.The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while staying near its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% each. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are stuck under their 50-day lines.Volume in the stock market today fell on both major exchanges. Recently, losses have come in rising volume, while gains have come in declining volume. That's the opposite of what bulls like to see.The Dow Jones utility average was a top performer Wednesday, rising 1%. Given the chatter about an interest rate hike, the gain in the utility average was unexpected. (Higher interest rates make dividend-paying utilities less attractive.) From a wider perspective, some kind of rebound was no surprise. The utility average has retreated about 11% since its July 6 high.Consolidated Edison (ED) has dropped 11% off its high. The stock rose almost 1%, after falling in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. PPL (PPL) also bounced 1% higher, but it remains 18% off its high. The electric utility has skidded in 10 of the previous 11 sessions.Banks, which are likely to benefit from higher rates, made no dramatic moves Wednesday. Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were nearly flat. Citigroup (C) trimmed 0.5%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a Phoenix-based midcap, advanced 0.6%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, dairy products and gold and silver miners booked the best gains for the day, according to preliminary data. Biotechs took the hardest hit.Blue chips were almost even between winners and losers. Dow components Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) led with gains of about 1%.In the S&P 500, Kroger (KR) grabbed the pole position with a 3% pop. A recent Morgan Stanley report said Kroger's alternative formats have not been fully priced into the stock. Rumors also have swirled over a possible merger with Whole Foods Market (WFM).The Fed minutes from the September meeting showed three members favoring an immediate rate hike. They lost the argument, but may have set the tone for a rate hike in December.IBD'S TAKE: An uptrend under pressure makes buying stocks more risky than ideal, but some stocks could be setting up for breakouts.Railway CSX (CSX) reported quarterly results after the close. CSX fell 1% in regular trading Wednesday, its fourth daily loss in a row, and was slightly higher in extended trading. The Street's consensus estimate was for earnings of 45 cents a share, but the number came in at 48 cents. Revenue fell 8%.RELATED:Fed Hawks Are Gaining SwayPessimists Still Down On IBM, Which Reports Monday

866,L,"Stocks resumed their stiff selling in the first hour of trading Thursday following a sharper drop in weekly jobless claims than expected. The further evidence of a strengthening economy likely boosts the chance of a nominal hike in interest rates in December, and investors are deciding to take a more defensive stance this week. Wall Street was also spooked by weak export data out of China.The Nasdaq composite fell 1.3%, hurt by sharp drops in big-cap techs, before rebounding a bit. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were both down around 0.8% to 0.9%. Small caps also saw fierce selling. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both sank, dropping more than 1.3% initially before shaving their losses a tad.The Dow utility average rallied more than 0.5%. It's a relatively weak rebound, though, considering that in the prior two weeks the index lost more than a combined 7% in value and barreled below both its 10-week and 40-week moving averages (please see a weekly chart at Marketsmith.com).The Nasdaq is showing further weakness after reversing from small gains and closing slightly below its 50-day moving average on Wednesday. On Tuesday, IBD changed the current outlook for the market to ""uptrend under pressure"" due to an escalation in heavy institutional selling in recent weeks.On Monday, the Nasdaq slid 1.5% in higher volume, a classic distribution day in which fund managers actively took profits. The Nasdaq had climbed as much as 16% since hitting a near-term bottom of 4574 on June 27. Three sessions later, it posted a rare Day 3 follow-through, signaling a potential market bottom was in place.Qualcomm (QCOM), the wireless chip play, is down 2.6% to 64.34 as shares continue to pull back following a 9% rally in the last week of September. Chip and wireless-related stocks are cooling off after poor quarterly results coming from wireless gear supplier Ericsson (ERIC) on Wednesday.See if Qualcomm can continue to hold its recent new trend of higher highs and higher lows. On July 22, the stock broke out of a bottoming base and leapt past a 56.37 buy point in a super-long saucer with handle structure in big volume. The strong move also enabled Qualcomm to shatter a long-term downtrend. The catalyst: a 17% jump in earnings per share, breaking a four-quarter streak of falling profit, on a 4% lift in revenue.In mid-September, shares then made a successful rebound off the 50-day moving average near 60, providing a second opportunity to scoop up shares.Apple (AAPL) is posting its first decline after a seven-session run that has taken shares up as much as 7.6% above a new 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares eased 1% to 116.11, still extended past that proper entry.On the upside, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gapped up at the open and rose more than 6% to 254.90 in fast turnover following bullish earnings guidance. The cosmetics and beauty products retailer also sees 20%+ EPS growth through 2019.Ulta has been one of the best performing consumer products and retailing stocks in recent years. Shares have now taken back the 10-week moving average and are now fashioning the right side of a potential new base.Ulta's latest breakout came in March with a breakaway gap past a 188.58 pivot point. Currently, the stock boasts a solid 94 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, which means its combination of earnings and sales fundamentals, price action and institutional sponsorship is superior to 94% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base Chart Pattern?Ulta Sees Robust Profit Growth Through 2019Why Apple Shares Are Still Crisp After Breaking Out

Stocks yawned amid clear evidence of a growing rift in views on interest rates among leaders of the most powerful financial institution in the U.S. The market on Wednesday likely disappointed the bulls as much as the bears.

868,L,"Stocks opened mostly lower Wednesday, but the major averages quickly returned to narrowly mixed after Tuesday's sharp sell-off. The Nasdaq fell nearly 0.1%, below the 50-day line. The Dow industrials rose a fraction while the S&P 500 climbed 0.1%.Tech stocks were battling through a tough premarket session with profit warnings from Samsung, Ericsson and Fortinet a focus in early trade. Commodities were quiet, bonds, gold and oil sagging slightly, and the dollar up ahead of the FOMC minutes due out this afternoon.Apple (AAPL) bolstered the Nasdaq 100 with a gain of less than 1%. Apple's advantage over Samsung has been bolstered by the shutdown of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smart phone product line due to overheating batteries. Samsung on Wednesday lowered its third-quarter earnings and revenue guidance because of the loss in Note 7 sales.Ericsson (ERIC) crumbled 19% in early trade after the networking gear and handset maker prereleased disappointing third-quarter results.Security software makers were under pressure before the open. Fortinet (FTNT) tumbled 13% after sharply reducing its third-quarter earnings and revenue outlook. Check Point Software (CHKP) and FireEye (FEYE) fell about 1%.Barracuda Networks (CUDA) was a standout among security software plays, rising 11% after scoring a healthy second-quarter sales and earnings win. Barracuda ended Tuesday in a test of support at its 10-week moving average. In July, the stock cleared a double-bottom base, formed within a deep consolidation.Newell Brands (NWL) rose more than 1%. The owner of the Rubbermaid, Sharpie and Papermate brands said it would sell its hand tools business to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) for $2 billion. Newell has been digging deeper into a gradual consolidation since August. Stanley shares climbed nearly 2%.The number of jobs available among U.S. employers fell to 5.443 million in August from a downwardly revised 5.831 million in July, the Labor Department reported.The Federal Open Market Committee will release minutes from its Sept. 21 meeting at 2 p.m. ET.Oil prices backed down from early gains, with West Texas Intermediate down 1% to just below $51 a barrel. Gold eased a fraction, to just above $1,255 an ounce. The dollar continued to rise against the euro and the yen. Bonds backed off, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield another 2 basis points to 1.79%.Overseas, markets across Asia closed lower, led by the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo, which booked a 1.1% decline. Europe's markets were under mild pressure with London's FTSE 100 down 0.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris slumping 0.3% in afternoon trade.
"
869,L,"Stocks traded nominally lower by early afternoon Wednesday, but some tech stocks and a young, fast-growing homebuilder affirmed that growth investors have opportunities to capitalize.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which seems to have escaped a number of egg-in-the-face headlines in recent years including big fines by the government and a huge trading loss courtesy of the ""London Whale,"" is holding firm amid more hints among Federal Reserve leaders that a rate hike is still in the cards later this year. In fact, it's legitimate to say that JPMorgan shares have broken out of a nine-week cup with handle with a 65.08 buy point in solid volume on Aug. 5.Volume that week jumped sharply vs. the prior week, a good sign for breakouts. The stock, however, is still within a much longer consolidation that stretches back to an all-time peak of 70.61 in July 2015. The stock edged 0.5% lower to 67.11, still in buy range from the recent 65.08 pivot point. The 5% chase zone extends up to 68.33.San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank chief John Williams reportedly said that another a rise in short-term interest rates ""is on the table"" when the U.S. central bank meets on interest rate policy on Sept. 20-21. Williams told reporters in Reno, Nev., that the U.S. economy is at full employment and ""within sight"" of the 2% inflation target, Reuters said. However, Williams also cautioned against rapid rate increases in the future due to low productivity growth and an aging population that buffers the potential growth rate of the future economy.The Nasdaq composite rallied to a new all-time high of 5287 before receding to drop 0.15%. On Tuesday, IBD's current outlook for the market switched from ""Uptrend under pressure"" to ""Uptrend resumes."" The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials lost about 0.25%.Despite the piecemeal moves, stocks in the IBD 50 showed fortitude, indicating continued optimism among fund managers about both the economy and earnings in the second half of the year. LGI Homes (LGIH), No. 2 within the IBD 50, jumped more than 2% to 39.64. Volume was running more than 90% higher than its usual pace. Its 50-day average volume is 528,000 shares. The homebuilder is on a mission to expand its starter home strategy across the country and is making progress in the Pacific Northwest. LGI Homes reported strong home closings for August late Tuesday.The stock showed a bullish bounce off its 50-day moving average near 31 on Aug. 4. A few days later, the small cap shot back above a 34.60 alternate buy point within a long and deep cup base. LGI, based in Woodlands, Texas, sports a top-notch 99 EPS Rating as earnings per share have grown on average a blistering 79% vs. year-ago levels over the past three quarters.Also in the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC), Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) and food reservation and ordering service GrubHub (GRUB) continue to act well and remain in solid uptrends. Paycom has risen more than 20% past a 42.70 handle buy point, justifying a move to sell at least some shares and capture profits. Ubiquiti has also achieved a 20%-25% profit from a proper breakout at 41.31. Yet those with strong conviction and a big profit cushion have the option to be patient and hold through the next normal correction.JPMorgan's Banks-Money Center industry group is still lagging the S&P 500, up less than 4% year-to-date. However, more interest rates would likely give some sort of boost to many lenders, who have seen their profit margins on conventional loans get pinched due to near-zero rates. In the same group, Bank of Montreal (BMO) pulled back 0.9% to 66.84, still above a recent flat-base breakout at 66.39.The large-cap Canadian bank is a leader with a 77 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, a 66 EPS Rating, 74 RS and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio, which indicates that volume on up days in price has exceeded downside volume over the past 50 sessions.Morgan Stanley (MS), also in the same group, has rallied nicely since retaking its 50-day line in early June and is now basing. Watch for a potential buy point to develop near 35. Bank of America (BAC) has formed a somewhat wide-and-loose long cup with handle with a 16.34 buy point. The base passes the midpoint test (midpoint of the handle at 15.95, midpoint of the base at 14.54).Ferrari (RACE) is not in the IBD 50, yet its breakout also deserves notice. The Italian sports car maker, featured in the IBD Stock Market Today column on Aug. 2, rose more than 2% in fast trading, revving past a 49.21 handle buy point within a long first-stage cup pattern. The stock went public on Oct. 21 last year and had a sterling debut, rising to as high as 60.97 before fading fast. In early December, Ferrari encountered upside resistance near 50.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle base is one of more than seven bullish patterns that savvy growth investors must know in order to capture big gains in the biggest stock market winners.

871,L,"""You might see it three or four miles off before you come around the bend, and then you say, 'That is a basket. That is unquestionably a basket,'"" said Tom Rochon.It is a basket, or rather, a seven-story office building shaped like one -- a massive facsimile of the signature picnic basket made by the company once headquartered there. Some 40 miles outside Columbus, Ohio, the basket building, as it's locally known, is one of the area's grandest attractions, inviting quirky selfie-seekers, architecture nerds, and, of course, basket enthusiasts.Despite its celebrity, its owner has had trouble offloading the gargantuan basket, due to its size, location, and — well, you've seen it, right?When the property — slightly larger than another Ohio landmark, Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame — was listed 18 months ago, the asking price was $7.5 million. Now it's on the market for $5 million, or about $28 a square foot, about half of what traditionally shaped office buildings in the area usually sell for, according to Columbus real estate advisor Bradford L. Kitchen, president of the real estate advisory firm Alterra. The basket building's listing agent, Michael Guagenti of Cushman & Wakefield, said commercial property in the area typically ranges from $50 to $80 a square foot.The basket was built for about $32 million and finished in 1997, according to Guagenti, as a home for Longaberger. Known for its kitschy baskets, both decorative and functional, Longaberger has been around since the 1970s and once boasted sales of $1 billion, largely the result of direct-sales agents who hawked baskets at Tupperware-esque parties. But its sales reportedly fell to $100 million in 2012. As Longaberger moved workers from the basket building to a nearby factory, its Dallas-based holding company, JRJR Networks, for which Rochon works, decided to sell to ""consolidate and streamline our operations,"" Chief Financial Officer Chris Brooks said in a June earnings statement.Guagenti admitted it's the most unusual property he's tried to sell. ""It's a very challenging building,"" he said. ""We have had a couple [offers] but nothing that materialized."" Thus far, only developers have shown interest, though Guagenti declined to specify the number or size of the bids.At 180,000 square feet, the basket is one of the largest buildings for miles around. Guagenti has reached out to local businesses in an effort to convince them to move, playing up the basket's discounted price, but the space is too large for most. ""Just no one is big enough to take that kind of basket on.""And it's not without other flaws. Paint has trouble adhering to its massive handles, which are heated to prevent snow buildup, and as a result they look chipped, said Rochon. The entire basket could use a paint job, Guagenti agreed, though he said the interior is pristine and modern. ""There's nothing baskety inside,"" he said. ""Nothing makes you feel like it's in a basket. You feel like you're in a nice, high-rise office building.""But while paint can be reapplied, the building can't be moved.""It's like they say: location, location, location. It has two things against it: It's a far location, and it's a unique building. The location is probably what's worse,"" said New York-based real estate broker and author Brendon DeSimone.Local real estate advisor Kitchen agreed: ""It takes a special buyer that is willing to go to that location. It's a little bit too remote, as it's just outside Columbus. It's pretty far out for a Columbus company to think of moving there."" If the building were closer to town, Guagenti thinks he would have sold it by now.That has meant rethinking how the building could be used. To lure a buyer, Guagenti has explored marketing it as ripe for being repurposed as an educational facility, nursing home, or call center — though he also thinks it would do just fine remaining an office building. Experts agree it might fare best as a hotel or convention center, using the building's aesthetic to attract tourists. Although the area has a population of only about 47,000, Rochon said tour groups do occasionally make pit stops at the basket.As for the fundamental basket-ness of it, it's not clear how much can be done. Refacing the building isn't much of an option, Guagenti said, because much like a basket, it's narrower on the bottom and wider on top, which would look strange even without the woven exterior.""But you could take the handles off,"" he reasoned. ""I'm sure a good architect could come up with some paint scheme to make it look not like a basket.""RELATED:Warehouse Space At A Premium As Retailers Race Against AmazonChic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdOnce-Empty Bell Labs Building Revived As New Jersey Tech Hub

872,L,"Civility and political decorum demand that one should never pick on a president's family. Presidents' children did not choose their parents' careers. Until they are grown and speaking out on the campaign trail, they should be left out of political commentary. Their privacy should not only be respected; it should be actively protected.Pretty much the entire media observed this rule perfectly when Radar Online published blurry pictures of 18-year-old Malia Obama puffing some sort of cigarette at the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, Illinois on July 31. Radar's eyewitness cried weed. Video footage also showed Obama dancing suggestively to a rap song.The press refused to touch the story. Praiseworthy? Yes -- if you're willing to applaud media hypocrisy.In the middle of 2001, the media pointed at and mocked Jenna and Barbara Bush, daughters of former President George W. Bush, when they were cited for underage margarita drinking in Austin, Texas, at age 19. The New York tabloids loved it. The story was headlined ''Double Trouble'' by the New York Daily News and ''Jenna and Tonic'' by the New York Post. The networks jumped all over it, underlining that this was the public's business because the twins had entered the police blotter, and because their father is a recovered alcoholic.CNN's Wolf Blitzer also sounded the alarm: ""Police in Austin, Texas today cited President Bush's twin daughters for violating state alcoholic beverage laws. Questions about the incident remain off limits at the White House. As CNN's Anne McDermott reminds us, all first families struggle to retain a little privacy."" Apparently CNN believed the Bush family should be an exception.Even back then, there was a police-and-progeny double standard. The year before, 17-year-old Al Gore III, son of then-Vice President Al Gore, was cited by police for driving back to Washington, D.C. from the Outer Banks of North Carolina at 97 mph in a 55-mph zone. Network coverage? Zero.Obama gets much kinder treatment than the daughters of Republican presidential candidates. Consider the liberal website Slate, which in 2012 held a caption contest for a picture of former Sen. Rick Santorum's daughters Elizabeth and Sarah (then ages 21 and 14). Sadly, liberal commenters predictably leaped to imagine that these conservative Catholic daughters -- yes, including the middle schooler -- were on contraceptives or wearing chastity belts or touching themselves sexually.The daughters of former Gov. Sarah Palin have faced all kinds of media shaming and mockery, starting with Bristol Palin's pregnancy at age 17, revealed just hours after Palin was named to Sen. John McCain's ticket in 2008. Gov. Palin never achieved national office, but her family has been mocked ever since.In 2011, television host Bill Maher mocked Bristol Palin in the crudest terms. Did the media decry a lack of decency? The silence was deafening. But when previously unknown GOP congressional staffer Elizabeth Lauten criticized the clothes and attitude of President Obama's daughters two years ago on her own Facebook page, saying, ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar,"" the networks railed against her for ""cyberbullying"" until she resigned from her job.Our news and entertainment media chieftains have made a clear distinction for presidents and presidential candidates: A child of Democratic parents is untouchable, but if it's the offspring of Republicans, he -- or even better, she -- is fair game. It's open season.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

873,L,"In the wake of the Dallas police murders, Hollywood liberals such as Lena Dunham have chosen to target ... action movie posters. On social media, Dunham boosted a crusade to remove the gun from Matt Damon's hand in New York subway ads for the latest ""Bourne Identity"" movie.Since the left insists on diverting attention from the coldblooded murder of Dallas policemen, let's turn instead to this other piece of Texas news that will put gun-hating, Planned Parenthood-boosting feminists like Dunham in the proper perspective.Bobby Ross Jr. at the blog Get Religion recently noted an article in the Houston Chronicle titled ""The costly economics of fetus disposal."" Troublemaking conservative lawmakers in Texas are proposing a law requiring that ""all fetal remains extracted at health care facilities ... be disposed of through burial or cremation, rather than sanitary waste disposal.""That cannot be allowed to stand. Chronicle reporter Lydia DePillis wrote a poorly disguised editorial that only made this faint nod to pro-lifers: ""Proponents of the rule (say) it has to do with 'dignity.' "" Then she immediately debunked it. ""But like the now-overturned law known as HB-2, this would have a costly side effect as well.""The reporter equated fetal remains with fecal matter. ""Disposal of medical waste, which can include human tissue as well as anything soaked in bodily fluids, isn't just like your typical curbside garbage pickup,"" she explained. But ""for a clinic or hospital that carries out many procedures a day, it doesn't add much to the total price: Two companies the Chronicle called, Biomedical Waste Solutions and Cyntox, ranged between $50 to $100 for weekly pickup of one 28-gallon box.""Asher Price of the Austin American-Statesman reported on the daily disposal of ""procedures"" in a rather unforgettable way: ""Current rules allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or 'an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill.' ""Fetal remains can be ""ground"" like hamburger until they're ""unrecognizable,"" and get discharged into a sewer or incinerated. Somehow, pro-lifers find this an affront to human ""dignity.""DePillis implies this is a legislative prank, another ""undue burden"" on abortion access that judges must and will overturn. Burial or cremation is much more expensive. ""Although aborted fetuses are smaller than a golf ball in the first trimester, cremation can still cost several hundred dollars: The Neptune Society in Houston says it charges $595 for cremating a baby. Burial is even more costly. Houston's Miller Funeral and Cremation Services says the fee for burying a baby is $2,695, plus the cost of a grave site, which is currently about $400.""DePillis huffs to her pro-abortion rights conclusion: ""If the rule goes into effect as planned, it may be that hospitals and abortion clinics find some solution to keep costs down, perhaps through negotiating bulk rates. But it's sure not going to make accessing abortion any easier.""Like Lena Dunham, DePillis has a strange moral calculus. A year ago, DePillis wrote an equally editorializing article for The Washington Post, touting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' filing a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration asking that the agency ""prohibit humans from physically interacting with elephants in captivity, making the case that doing so is a preventable hazard that should be banned outright.""Circus elephants should be liberated. Unborn babies should be incinerated. That's the fun house morality of the libertine left.

874,L,"When white racist Dylann Roof allegedly shot and killed nine people in a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, it was very easy for President Obama and his media enablers to paint with a broad brush and blame the wider political culture. Bill Maher even blamed Fox News and the Daily Caller and the Drudge Report.But when black racist Micah Johnson gunned down five cops and wounded seven others in Dallas, suddenly the motivation was complicated, and it couldn't be blamed on a ""climate"" of hostile rhetoric.Dallas police Chief David Brown reported, ""The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers."" His Facebook page had ""likes"" for Black Lives Matter and the New Black Panther Party.But in a news conference on Saturday in Warsaw, President Obama ignored that, claiming it was ""very hard to untangle the motives of the shooter."" It couldn't be blamed on the rhetoric of, for example, Black Lives Matter protesters, who chanted, ""Pigs in a blanket. Fry 'em like bacon.""But the media gushed over the speech Obama gave in the wake of the Charleston shooting, as the president hammered home a denunciation of racism. ""The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history. This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked, and we know the hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.""Nobody expects Obama to stand anywhere and say anything like that about Black Lives Matter or the New Black Panthers. Shouldn't that alone be a news story?It won't be, because the same double standard occurs in the media. MSNBC analyst and Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson announced after the shooting in Charleston, ""There's more than a whiff of white supremacy in the air. It's still a stench. It's fainter than it used to be, but it's there. And somehow he breathed it in.""Chris Matthews agreed: ""I do think you've got something there with the atmospherics. And it's not all one person acting alone, it's always about something that gives moral license to certain kind of behavior.""But after Dallas, Robinson wrote a column that completely avoided Johnson's motives and absolved the Black Lives Matter agitators. ""I hope police officers around the nation see how rapidly and completely the people of Dallas -- including those in the Black Lives Matter movement -- have rallied around their city's bereaved Police Department. ... Such tragedy is beyond color.""Likewise, The New York Times editorial board pretended that Johnson's motive in Dallas was an unsolvable puzzle: ""In the aftermath, possible motives will be ticked off for the killer and any accomplices. But the police and protesters alike could only wonder what might truly account for such a level of atrocity.""But after the Tucson shooting in 2011, when madman Jared Loughner killed six and wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the same editorialists wrote it would be ""facile"" to blame the tea party or the GOP, but ""it is legitimate to hold Republicans and particularly their most virulent supporters in the media responsible for the gale of anger that has produced the vast majority of these threats, setting the nation on edge. Many on the right have exploited the arguments of division, reaping political power by demonizing immigrants, or welfare recipients, or bureaucrats.""Conservatives start by blaming murder on the actual murderer, not a ""climate."" And yet liberals only blame a ""climate of hatred"" when they can smear it on conservatives. The left's hatred is perennially dismissed as a cause, and not recognized as a blight on our discourse.

876,L,"Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays will replace liquid crystal display (LCD) screens as the leading smartphone display technology in 2020, research firm IHS Markit (INFO) predicted in a report issued Monday.Samsung Electronics has already adopted OLED displays in its flagship smartphones, such as the Galaxy  S7, and there is increasing demand for OLED displays from Chinese vendors Huawei, OPPO Electronics, Vivo, Meizu Technology and others.Apple (AAPL) is expected to switch to OLED displays for next year's iPhone 8.""Apple's upcoming adoption of OLED displays will be a milestone for OLED in the display industry,"" David Hsieh, senior director of IHS Markit, said in a statement.Universal Display (OLED), a supplier of materials and technology for OLED products, is expected to benefit from the rising demand. Its stock has risen more than 40% in the past 12 months. But on Tuesday, Universal Display stock closed 1.4% at 67.33 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display stock is benefiting from excitement around the adoption of OLED display technology. The stock is on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of growth companies showing strong relative price strength and top fundamentals.LCD screens have dominated mobile-phone displays for more than 15 years, but OLED displays are flexible, thinner and more power efficient.AMOLED displays with a low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) backplane will account for more than one-third (36%) of all smartphone displays shipped in 2020, becoming the most-used display technology in smartphone displays, IHS said. It will surpass a-Si (amorphous silicon) thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD and LTPS TFT LCD displays.""While OLED is currently more difficult to manufacture, uses more complicated materials and chemical processes, and requires a keen focus on yield-rate management, it is an increasingly attractive technology for smartphone brands,"" Hsieh said. ""OLED displays are not only thinner and lighter than LCD displays, but they also boast better color performance and enable flexible display form factors that can lead to more innovative design.""Samsung Display leads in OLED display production today, but rivals are ramping up their manufacturing capabilities. They include LG Display (LPL), Sharp, JDI, BOE, Tianma, GVO, Truly and CSOT, IHS said.RELATED:OLED Display Shortage Could Crimp Apple's iPhone 8 Plans

877,L,"The Sept. 26 issue of Time magazine cover featured the heads of comedians Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel, and the headline ""We Joke. You Decide."" The allusion to the Fox News tagline was deliberate. The subheadline declared that they would report on ""The seriously partisan politics of late-night comedy.""Finally, liberals are acknowledging what conservatives have claimed for years.Inside, the headline was ""The New Politics of Late Night."" And writer Richard Zoglin began the article saying, ""In a wild election with a ripe orange target, comics are ditching balance and taking sides."" Zoglin started with a collection of Bee stingers, calling her description of the Republican convention a ""poorly attended rage-athon of hemorrhoidal has-beens.""But just when you thought Zoglin was going to concede and celebrate the left-wing tilt of late-night TV, his analysis fell apart — as liberals' analyses normally do when they are called to analyze the obvious.Zoglin quoted Bee saying that Jon Stewart ""worked really hard to try to be nonpartisan."" Baloney. But he also proclaimed that the departures of Stewart, David Letterman and Colbert's fake-Bill-O'Reilly brought ""an unexpected and largely unappreciated payoff."" The new comedians are shooting arrows ""from the left flank"" and have ""triggered an extreme makeover"" of political satire, which is now more pointed and ""partisan than ever before.""This is a payoff? For whom? Zoglin touted their ""fresh perspective on the increasingly vitriolic U.S. political scene."" But they are the ones who are increasingly overflowing with infantile vitriol about their opponents being ""hemorrhoidal."" What's ""fresh"" about that?Apparently the ""payoff"" is the comedians convincing the press to get even nastier with Republicans. Noah told Time: ""There's a certain level of naiveté when you say Hillary Clinton is worse than Trump. I think that's a very dangerous position to be in. And I think the press has gotten to a place where they are realizing it's about truth and not neutrality.""The comedians and the press must favor ""the truth."" That's the Clinton side — the lovers of ""truth""? Trump's existence is somehow entirely mythical, as Bee contended saying, ""News organizations simply are not equipped to cover a candidate whose entire being is a lie.""It gets better, folks. Of NBC's Meyers, Zoglin claimed that ""it is rare, not to say unprecedented, for the host of a mainstream network show to push such a blatant political viewpoint, yet Meyers says NBC is fully on board."" Zoglin somehow slept through the precedent of the last two election cycles, where Comcast loaded up Barack Obama's campaign treasury, and NBC added in-kind contributions at the newsrooms and entertainment studios. In 2012, which NBC comedian mocked Obama? And which NBC comedian (SET ITAL) didn't (END ITAL) mock GOP nominee Mitt Romney?Obama knew he could show up at Comedy Central with that ""nonpartisan"" Stewart slobbering at his feet, in awe.The ""satire"" spared the Democrats never seems to come up. Zoglin briefly mentioned that Hillary Clinton ""gets her share of jabs,"" but he couldn't be bothered to quote one, while he eagerly shared anti-Trump insults, like Bee's calling him a ""sociopathic 70-year-old toddler.""He didn't mention how Meyers lectured grumpy Bernie backers at Democrat convention time: ""We're on the cusp of electing a racist demagogue, and that never ends well. I don't know which class you ditched to go to those Bernie rallies, but I have a feeling it was history."" By way of contrast, Kimmel offered his show to Clinton by letting her open a jar of pickles on stage to mock those who question her healthiness.The network comedians are pressuring the network ""news"" to abandon any pretense of fairness and use the full force of their propaganda power to tar and feather Trump. It's working.

880,L,"Analysts are bullish on top defense stocks Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raython (RTN), L3 Communications (LLL) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as military spending is expected to ramp up on growing tensions in Syria, Ukraine and the South China Sea.In a note Thursday, Baird analyst Peter Arment wrote that the U.S. defense budget will keep rising and contractor backlogs will get a boost from both domestic and foreign military sales.Weapons spending by the Pentagon was up 16% in fiscal year 2016 and Arment expects spending to rise at least 5% in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and will ""remain a tailwind for contractor backlogs.""Raytheon was started with an outperform rating and 170 price target by Baird. Arment wrote that the company ""was highly levered to key areas such as missile defense and prevision weaponry."" But Raytheon's sales are more dependent than peers on international sales, and lower oil prices could put pressure on weapons sales from the Middle East.Northrop, which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, was started with an outperform rating and a 260 price target as production on the stealth fighter ramps up and development of the B-21 bomber continues. But like Raytheon, Northrop also faces uncertainty from foreign buyers.Raytheon shares rose 1.12 to 138.25 on the stock market today and is consolidating in a flat base as it tries to retake its 50-day line. Northrop shares rose 1.73 to 214.21, finding resistance at the 50-day line over the last several sessions. It's also forming a base.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing, Lockheed, and others are vying for helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Baird included Raytheon and Northrop in its list of top defense picks, along with L3 Communications, which makes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.Baird rated L3 outperform and gave it a 184 price target, saying much of its sales are tied to a growing budget for classified programs.Lockheed was also initiated with an outperform rating and a 285 price target. But the prime contractor on the F-35 didn't make the top picks list, and Arment warned that pension issues could weigh on the stock.L3 shares, which broke out of a cup base in May, edged up 2.09 to 152.54 Thursday, nearing profit-taking sell territory for those who bought at the May breakout.

881,L,"When the Washington Post puts its top investigative reporters on the beat of the distant youth of presidential candidates, there's no telling what student scandal they might uncover. In 2012, the Post devoted a 5,400-word, front-page article to breaking the news that at age 17, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney's ""pranks could go too far."" He was accused of giving a classmate at Cranbrook School an involuntary haircut, and this was invested with deep meaning across his life.Sometimes, however, the investigation produces a different result. On Aug. 15, 2016, the Post once again displayed on the front page the labor of its hard-boiled, first-draft historians, who were again dwelling on a school scene. This time, the subject was a Democrat, and the headline reflected it: ""At Wellesley, fiery speech was a breakout moment.""In 1969, Hillary Clinton gave a speech at her Wellesley College commencement ceremony insulting liberal Republican Sen. Edward Brooke as too conservative, too out of touch. It was a ""moment of glory,"" the Post proclaimed, the culmination of what ""her campaign now describes as 'social-justice activism.'""In summation, young Republican Mitt Romney was the worst kind of pampered prep-school bully. Young Democrat Hillary Clinton was a ""provocative voice speaking for her angry generation."" If partisan profiling were illegal, these journalists would be arrested.Reporters Frances Stead Sellers and Marilyn W. Thompson gushed: ""Clinton's remarks transformed her, virtually overnight, into a national symbol of student activism. Wire services blasted out her remarks, and Life magazine featured a photo of her, dressed in bold striped bell-bottoms.""Sellers and Thompson weren't digging up dirt. They were creating a sugary valentine, looking at old pictures and seeking out Clinton pals for the warmest recollections to fill the narrative. In Sen. Brooke's archived papers, the reporters found a letter from Wellesley President Ruth Adams on June 5, 1969, in which she apologized for Clinton's public rebuke. Adams said, ""Courtesy is not one of the stronger virtues of the young."" But how do we harness such ""youthful passion,"" Adams asked, ""without destroying the basic fabric of our democratic society?""

882,L,"More than 40 years later, the Post is performing damage control.While it would have you believe that Romney displayed only a mean streak in his youth, it would also have you believe that Clinton's ""knack for public speaking was obvious to anyone who saw her onstage at an outdoor demonstration in her sophomore year."" A former professor oozed, ""She had this formidable quality of poise, of self-control, of self-containment.""The Post even found audio of Clinton's speech. It doesn't display a formidable public speaker. Instead, it reveals a callow young woman saying idealistic things that don't sound anything like the hardened Clinton we know today. Get a load of this line from the lady with a $10 million family income on the latest tax return. Clinton said, ""There are some things we feel, feelings that our prevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life, including tragically the universities, is not the way of life for us.""She mused about ""authentic reality and inauthentic reality,"" which can certainly apply to the answers she provides when under investigation, even under oath.

Even better, they could have asked her. But inside the media bubble, they can't contemplate what people who don't love Clinton might make of this speech, and they can't imagine how many don't swoon over a lecturing ""social-justice warrior"" in striped bell-bottoms.

888,L,"Private-sector jobs rose solidly once again in August, according to a new report. But yet another regional factory gauge indicated slower growth -- or outright contraction. Meanwhile, housing demand remains strong.Companies have been staffing up in recent months, even as economic growth remains sluggish, creating a puzzle for investors and Federal Reserve policymakers. It's unclear how long that disconnect can continue. But Wednesday's data presage bigger news later this week, including Friday's employment report.Companies added 177,000 workers in August vs. views for 175,000. July's gains was revised up to 194,000.  Goods-producing industries, including manufacturing and construction, cut 6,000 jobs.Still, it's another strong indication that hiring is strong ahead of Friday's nonfarm payroll report from the Labor Department. Economists expect that report to show a rise of 175,000 jobs and a jobless rate of 4.8%.The ISM-Chicago manufacturing index fell 4.3 points in August to 51.5, signaling decelerating but continued growth for factories in the Midwest area. Backlogs and orders were weak, though the employment gauge hit a 16-month best.Other regional manufacturing reports have been mixed but generally weak. Meanwhile, companies have offered mixed reports. General Electric (GE) in Q2 reported sluggish organic revenue and a big drop in industrial orders. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier, after Ford had predicted that domestic industry sales would fall in 2016 and 2017.ISM's national manufacturing activity index is due out Thursday morning, with economists expecting a 0.4 point dip to 52.2, still above the neutral 50 level.General Motors, Ford and other automakers will report August U.S. sales on Thursday as well. Many analysts expect weaker demand as automakers try to cut incentives. The industry has relied on discounts, cheap credit, longer maturities and leases to keep moving the metal at record levels.The Pending Home Sales Index rose 1.3% to 111.3 in July after a downwardly revised 109.9 in June, the National Association of Realtors said.

Sales jumped 28% to $1 billion, continuing the firm's record of solid double-digit top-line growth. In the prior four quarters, sales grew a respective 29%, 28%, 31% and 30%. Strong footwear sales helped, rising 58% on the back of hot demand for the company's Stephen Curry-endorsed basketball shoes.As noted in an earlier IBD story, Under Armour wants to bolster its prestige with a new flagship store in the space formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz, the famed Manhattan toy store that closed years ago.It may be a while, however, before Under Armour becomes a stock market leader. It has been digesting long-term gains since topping at 52.95 in September last year. Tuesday's drop sent the stock back to its 200-day moving average -- useful as a gauge of long-term price trends -- and this line has been sloping lower since May.Under Armour gets a middling 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. An investor will likely have more success with growth stocks that are breaking out while showing a Composite Rating of 95 out of a maximum 99 or higher.Meanwhile, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped after hours after it reported bullish Q2 results. The IBD Leaderboard member earned 76 cents a share on an adjusted basis, well ahead of the consensus view of 70 cents. Revenue rose 23% to $759.3 million, sharply beating the $724 million consensus view. The 23% jump stretched Edwards' trend of accelerating top-line growth to a third straight quarter, up from gains of 1%, 9% and 18% in the prior three periods, respectively.Edwards ended Tuesday's regular session up nearly 2% to 108.31, just past a 107.69 double-bottom-with-handle entry.Small and medium-sized business expert Ultimate Software (ULTI) reported Q2 non-GAAP profit of 76 cents, up 23% and meeting the consensus estimate, as revenue rose 27% to $187 million. The stock fell 0.4% to 221.83 in the regular session, extended from a recent 209.81 pivot point.Earlier in the session, JetBlue (JBLU) gained 8% to 18.67 in triple the average volume after the airline posted a 20% jump in Q2 earnings to 53 cents a share, above Wall Street's view, with revenue gaining 2% to $1.64 billion. The stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average but was still flying below its downward-slanting 200-day line. The stock has a lot of lost ground to recover before getting to within proper buy range.The Dow Jones transport average climbed more than 1% on Tuesday.Among IBD 50 names, LGI Homes (LGIH) continued to roll higher, rising 2% to 36.20 in heavy trade. It's now advanced nearly 5% past a new handle entry point of 34.60. Homebuilders rallied on the back of better-than-expected U.S. new-home sales in June to an annualized rate of 592,000, sharply past the Econoday forecast of 562,000.LGI has increased its earnings per share a respective 53%, 124%, 121% and 73% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Wall Street sees Q2 earnings up 35% to 89 cents a share -- a slowdown from the prior four quarters, but an increase that would still meet the minimum 25% gain as required by IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points. The market followed through on June 30.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

890,L,"It didn't used to be -- that's a phrase we use a lot these days, isn't it? -- but the Fourth of July festivities bring out the angriest guff from the left. In 1991 Boston Globe arts critic (and aspiring poet) Patricia Smith decided to refashion the national anthem in the leftist rag The Nation.""Oh say, we've seen too much,"" she began. ""The Star-Spangled Banner pushes like a cough through America's mouth and the twilight's last gleaming is just that, a sickly flash above our heads as we ride unsuspecting in the bellies of sleek trains, plop to our knees in churches, embracing truths that disgust us.""That stupidity never gained traction. But that doesn't mean the idiots don't keep trying.The folks at the New York Daily News have embraced a mission to become the most provocative jerks in the Big Apple. One day it's personal attacks on those praying for the victims of terrorism, the next it's declaring the National Rifle Association to be murderous. In keeping with this stream of insulting behaviors, columnist Gersh Kuntzman has issued a demand, saying, ""Major League Baseball must permanently retire 'God Bless America,' a song that offends everyone.""Everyone? Surely, this man could find a handful of people in midtown Manhattan who aren't offended by ""God Bless America."" That isn't what he meant, however. By ""everyone"" he means his circle of friends, professional and personal, which says something more about his circles than his complaint.Kuntzman began: ""It's time for God to stop blessing America during the seventh-inning stretch. Welcome to the July 4 weekend -- when once again, baseball fans will be assaulted by the saccharine-sweet non-anthem 'God Bless America' at stadia all over this great land."" The song, he says, ""should be sent permanently to the bench.""This bilge came just days after Kuntzman drew attention for oddly comparing the AR-15 assault weapon to a bazooka: ""The recoil bruised my shoulder ... The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions -- loud like a bomb -- gave me a temporary form of PTSD.""Children in kindergarten have stronger dispositions than this guy.It's only natural that gun owners have mocked this overwrought routine. One video showed a little girl shooting an AR-15 without getting hurt. One man shot one with the butt of the gun pressed against the tip of his nose to show how harmless the recoil is.Since he enjoyed all the negative attention this brought, Kuntzman took to Twitter, promising, ""First guns, now I take on god: Baseball must permanently retire 'God Bless America.'"" Yes, God is uncapitalized.You can insult our Lord with impunity at the New York Daily News.Kuntzman protested the apparent fascism of the whole exercise, the ""ponderous Mussolini-esque introduction of the song, when fans are asked to rise, remove their caps and place them over their hearts."" He made wisecracks, saying it's ""as much a symbol of postwar patriotism as the flag, the space program and all the white people moving to the suburbs."" He says the song ""still embodies great things about America, but also our worst things: self-righteousness, forced piety, earnest self-reverence, foam.""He's not alone in hating a mix of baseball and patriotism. ESPN also has lurched far left in promoting a harsh political agenda. ESPN Magazine columnist Howard Bryant recently bashed the idea of police officers singing the national anthem at baseball games. This is somehow an ""authoritarian shift at the ballpark,"" he asserted.Baseball-team owners ignored ""the smothering effect that staged patriotism and cops singing the national anthem in a time of Ferguson have on player expression."" And ""it's indirectly stifled, while the increasing police pageantry at games sends another clear message: The sentiments of the poor in Ferguson and Cleveland do not matter.""According to Bryant powerful people in the culture have to choose: Honor the cops, screw the poor. Honoring the poor means dishonoring the police.Last November, Bryant attacked the Chicago Blackhawks for wearing camouflage jerseys on Veterans Day, which he said clashed with their Native American logo given that the ""systematic removal of native tribes occurred at the hands of the U.S. Army.""ESPN is the same network that fired Curt Schilling for being too political.

891,L,"The latest Gallup poll confirms that the level of trust in the media has reached another new low. The percentage of Republicans who hold a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust in the press has dropped precipitously to 14%, begging the question: Who are the 14% who are comfortable with the nonstop tirade against them?It's no accident these numbers emerge while the liberal press slams the GOP nominee as too dangerous to be allowed to win. Public trust is on the line when moderators line up for the presidential debates. Will they be fair, or will they decide ""history"" is too important, and pound on Donald Trump before a national audience? Some won't.Already, Fox's Chris Wallace drew liberal outrage by declaring: ""I do not believe that it's my job to be a truth squad. It's up to the other person to catch them on that."" Wallace sees his role as being like a referee in a heavyweight boxing match, where no one remembers him being there. But the left hounds today's liberal media, saying that being a mere referee is being an accessory to evil.Matt Lauer was hounded for failing to call out Trump in the NBC commander-in-chief forum for lying about his support for the Iraq war, and daring to question Hillary Clinton about her email scandal. The left is poised to rip into any journalist who doesn't tilt the playing field.It's been easily established over the last year that Trump can lie or mangle facts without regret. But how has it not been just as established that the Clintons lie and mangle facts without regret? Our so-called facts ""referees"" deplore the one at every opportunity, while tolerating, ignoring or even defending the other.On Sept. 19, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. was the latest pundit citing the liberal site that calls itself PolitiFact to suggest that Clinton is much more honest. Fifty-three percent of PolitiFact's Trump utterances, he says, were ruled ""False"" or ""Pants On Fire"" lies, compared to only 13% of Clinton's.This happens because PolitiFact routinely fails to assign its ""fact-checkers"" when Team Clinton lies through its teeth. For example, try to find the ruling for when the Clinton campaign said that Clinton left a 9/11 anniversary event because she was simply ""overheated."" That was a Pants on Fire moment. Similarly, PolitiFact refused to rule on whether Clinton lied to Benghazi families about a video being responsible for the loss of their loved ones.Then there are those Pants on Fire rulings on Trump. The latest one regarded Trump declaring that Clinton has no child care plan. Perhaps Dionne should talk to his fellow Post columnist Catherine Rampell. Three days before he cited PolitiFact as reliable, Rampell wrote that the Clinton campaign ""tweeted a snarky retort to (Trump), saying: 'It's literally right here,' with a link to (Clinton's) website."" Then, Rampell announced, ""But if you click that link, you'll discover that Trump is...not wrong."" What Clinton had offered was a gushy list of goals, with no plan to meet them.Nevertheless, PolitiFact proclaimed, ""we found two headings on the issues page of Clinton's website that seemed to address the question."" So, headings that ""seem"" to address an issue are somehow a plan? How does this ""fact"" make Trump a Pants on Fire liar?Journalists will analyze the ""facts"" of the debates as soon as they're over. But they want Trump to be thumped for ""lies"" in real time -- surely, so that Clinton can be proclaimed the ""winner,"" also in real time. They don't want to be referees. They want to be fighters who defeat Trump.

892,L," Any American who has sought refuge from politics by escaping into the world of sports realizes now that there is no escaping politics. In the last few months, it has become completely impossible to follow sports without being lectured about the oppressive ways of the United States, and its failures to achieve the highest of today's cultural goals: ""inclusion.""Leave that word in quotation marks because in the guise of  ""inclusion"" people will be most righteously excluded. In the name of ""tolerance,"" those condemned for intolerance will be boycotted and punished, unless they genuflect to ever-evolving ""anti-discrimination"" dictates.The state of North Carolina is being tarred and feathered in the sports world because it passed a bill in March stating that the state's public schools would abide by boy-girl divisions dating back to the advent of man. The bill said, ""Local boards of education shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used only by students based on their biological sex.""This, according to the gender-deconstructing left, is the ""new Jim Crow,"" a cruel and usual punishment of students who reject the gender they were ""assigned at birth."" Obama's Department of Justice used the media-created hubbub, replete with a phantom victimology, to mandate bathroom ""inclusion"" on every public school in America. Liberal state and local governments banned travel to North Carolina. Hollywood studios cancelled plans to film there. Musicians cancelled their concerts. But the most dramatic action came in the sports world.Dependent on TV contracts and corporate advertisers who now insist on political correctness, the sports leagues have fallen like dominoes. Even NASCAR issued a statement of disapproval. The NBA pulled its All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, in protest.In the last few days, the NCAA cancelled plans to hold basketball tournament games and championships in the state, and then the Atlantic Coast Conference, a league with four North Carolina athletic powerhouses, followed suit and withdrew all ""neutral-site championships"" from the state for this academic year.Everyone boycotting the state is demanding that North Carolina repeal this ""discriminatory"" bill. But if that happens, what happens next? Is every line-toeing sports bureaucrat ready for the next round of ""inclusion"" demands?For the next front of this war, let's turn to Cyd Zeigler, co-founder of the gay sports site Outsports. Zeigler briefly congratulated the NCAA for its stance but then insisted it will be ""meaningless"" unless the association follows his next demand: ""If the NCAA is serious, it is only a matter of time before BYU (Brigham Young University) gets kicked out of the association. And every other school with an anti-LGBT policy will be removed as well."" The writer singled out several religious schools for having policies ""far more sinister and discriminatory than North Carolina.""Should anyone be surprised? The cultural fascists are in charge.This czar of ""inclusion"" wants ""Christian"" schools -- and he put ""Christian"" in quotation marks -- banned from the league. The NCAA issued a statement saying that its ""values of inclusion and gender equity"" are ""for all."" Zeigler says that religious schools have to be banned, ""or the NCAA is failing on their own stated commitment.""Guess who else makes the LGBTQ-Unfriendly college list? The Princeton Review blacklist includes Auburn University, University of Arkansas, Baylor University, University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Wake Forest University, among others. Will the NCAA ban them all?What happens next? Brown University is demonstrating the latest insanity of the left. Students are distributing free tampons in every campus bathroom -- including the men's rooms. This is because pads and tampons are ""a necessity, rather than a luxury,"" and apparently not all people who menstruate are women.

893,L,"More positive comments were issued Monday on reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) is looking to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for at least $30 billion, or about $90 a share.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani raised his price target on Qualcomm to 70 from 59. He maintained a sector-perform rating but upped his price target to reflect the increased potential for a more diversified company with higher earnings per share and free cash flows that the deal could generate.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. It would create the second-largest chip company by revenue after Intel (INTC). Qualcomm is the leading supplier of cellphone chip sets. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Samsung and Nokia (NOK).""While the NXP transaction is certainly much larger vs. what investors had contemplated,"" Daryanani said in a research note, ""we think it offers Qualcomm with several unique assets to further enable diversity away from their 90% mobility exposure.""UBS analyst Stephen Chin also views the NXP deal positively.""If Qualcomm were to acquire NXP, we estimate sales exposure to the smartphone market would drop from about 90% of its current total to 68% overall,"" Chin wrote.Chin has a neutral rating on Qualcomm and a price target of 59. Assuming a deal is struck, Chin estimates a possible Qualcomm price target of 80, due to stronger revenue diversity.Qualcomm stock slid 2% to 67.11 on the stock market today. Qualcomm jumped 8% over two days last week as word of the possible deal was first revealed. NXP stock rose 0.7% to 102.76 on Monday. The stock is up 25% since reports of merger talks broke.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm sports an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past year based on a select group of IBD metrics. It also has a solid Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, indicating that institutional investors have been buying the stock.Last week, investment bank Mizuho raised its rating on Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 75. Cowen hiked its price target on Qualcomm to 74 from 62 and reiterated its outperform rating.RELATED:NXP Hires Adviser To Field Offers As Qualcomm Circles

894,L,"The CNN screen graphic at 6 p.m. on Sept. 12 was blunt: ""PENCE REFUSED TO CALL DAVID DUKE 'DEPLORABLE.'"" Donald Trump running mate Mike Pence had granted Wolf Blitzer a 30-minute interview, and what he received in return was a reckless leftist smear.Let's be clear about this interview. Blitzer offered 39 hostile questions or interjections about Trump's tax returns, medical records and charities, and made offensive remarks before asking a single question about policy. In the middle of this contentious exchange, Blitzer arrived at Hillary Clinton's recent gaffe of calling Trump backers a ""basket of deplorables.""Blitzer obnoxiously underlined that some Trump backers were truly deplorable: ""David Duke, for example, (and) some other white nationalists, (would) fit into that category of deplorables. Right?""Pence protested: ""I'm not really sure why the media keeps dropping David Duke's name. Donald Trump has denounced David Duke repeatedly. We don't want his support, and we don't want the support of people who think like him."" Blitzer pushed back: ""So you call him a deplorable. You would call him deplorable."" Pence replied, ""I'm not in the name-calling business, Wolf.""CNN ignored that denouncement of Duke and his backers. It was spiked in favor of a cheap National Enquirer-style ""Pence Won't Deplore Duke"" headline.It's the kind of ""gotcha"" journalism that has the public disgusted with the press. Whatever Pence answered would have been deemed wrong and exploited by the media. Had he uncorked the easy answer and called Duke deplorable, Blitzer and everyone else would have had their headlines read, ""Pence Admits Hillary Was Right."" Pence chose not to give them that luxury, so he gets ""Pence Won't Deplore Duke.""Do you imagine, in your wildest imagination, Blitzer posing any of these questions to Clinton running mate Tim Kaine?In an interview on Aug. 28, Blitzer's colleague, Jake Tapper, asked Pence about Duke's support for the umpteenth time. Tapper at least offered a ""that must really bother you"" expression. For his part, Pence blasted it over the fence, explicitly making a comparison between Duke and Seddique Mateen, saying, ""The fact that...a contemptable individual like that supports my running mate is no more relevant than the fact that the father of a man who killed 49 people in Orlando, Florida, was cheering Hillary Clinton at one of her rallies.""CNN could grill Kaine about a sympathetic September 2 story in The New York Times about the Democratic vice presidential nominee seeking out communist priests as his mentors in El Salvador and Nicaragua. He ""walked miles"" to meet Rev. James Carney, who even the Times reported took ""an extreme view of liberation theology that supported the taking up of arms against military oppressors."" Kaine's mentor, Rev. Jack Warner, believed ""the gospel is an extremely communist document.""Were these priests ""deplorables""? Did Kaine's hunger for their Marxist mumbo-jumbo make him deplorable?Here's another question CNN will never ask:""Hillary Clinton's husband has been exposed as a serial philanderer. He was impeached. He committed perjury, and was disbarred. There is also the accusation by Juanita Broaddrick that he raped her. Is Bill Clinton deplorable?""Instead, Blitzer & Co. unloads smears designed to help Hillary Clinton because they know she is in trouble. And CNN is all too willing to do Clinton's dirty work. Media credibility continues to erode in the polls because there is nothing the press won't undertake to slander conservatives.

896,L,"The stock market closed higher Monday, when a couple of leading stocks broke out of bases.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.6% gain. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Nasdaq 0.3%. Preliminary numbers showed volume fell noticeably from Friday, when Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen made a speech that fanned trading.Winners topped losers by 13 to 5 on the NYSE, a better breadth than on the Nasdaq, where advancers had a 12-to-7 advantage.Steel stocks rose after Deutsche Bank upgraded Allegheny Technologies (ATI) to buy from hold. The maker of specialty materials and components jumped 11%, ending near the 18.77 buy point of a pattern.Telecom infrastructure stocks also led, as Acacia Communications (ACIA) rose 5% in heavy trading. The stock is bouncing after taking a break last week from a torrid advance earlier this month.Medical services, outpatient care providers and hospitals were among a group of health care industry groups that also led, although biotechs and generic drug companies lagged. Utilities fared relatively better too, as the Dow utility average jumped 0.8%.Two leading stocks broke out of bases Monday.LGI Homes (LGIH) topped the 36.54 buy point of a flat base in more than double its usual volume. The homebuilder has the best combination of fundamentals and chart action among the homebuilding stocks.HealthEquity (HQY) cleared the 31.79 buy point of a flat base, although the pattern may also be interpreted as the handle of a larger base.

897,L,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) likely ""cranked up its resistance"" to Lam Research's (LRCX) pending $11 billion KLA-Tencor (KLAC) acquisition, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said Monday.Lam stock, though, continues to trade at record highs, touching an all-time best Monday.Rivals Applied Materials (AMAT) and Tokyo Electron have weaker voices with the U.S. Department of Justice given that they are the competition, Arcuri said. Clients like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are less likely to oppose the acquisition.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials stock rocketed earlier this month on fiscal Q3 sales and fiscal Q4 guidance that easily topped Wall Street's expectations.Samsung has pushed Lam and KLA to collaborate on 3D flash-memory yield challenges, and TSM seems fairly ambivalent, Arcuri wrote in a research report.""Thus, we are left with Intel, (a customer) whose management generally doesn't like when suppliers merge,"" he wrote. Intel ""may have cranked up its resistance and gained traction on the matter with regulators.""Lam's attempt to buy KLA has been stalled since May, when U.S. regulators sent a request for more information about the merger. Analysts have suggested the DOJ is concerned with antitrust matters. KLA's products rate tools created by Lam and its rivals.""A merger theoretically could help Samsung more than Intel given Samsung's 3D Nand (flash memory) leadership,"" he wrote in his research note. ""Also, Lam is ramping -- albeit very strongly -- with Intel, but has historically tended to have a very strong relationship with Samsung.""But the DOJ hasn't blocked a ""conglomerate"" transaction in more than 40 years. Doing so in this case would arguably set a precedent, Arcuri wrote. The idea of regulators blocking the deal on regulatory grounds is a 50/50 proposition at best, he said.Arcuri upgraded KLA stock to an outperform rating, with an 80 price target. He kept his 95 price target on Lam stock, but added that ""Lam is, without a question, a better stock with KLA.""Since the merger was announced on Oct. 21 of last year, Lam stock has lifted 33% and KLA stock 6%. KLA was near a sell zone Monday, down 6% from a 73.69 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20.Lam stock, on the other hand, is now far extended from an 83.93 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20. On the stock market today, shares of Lam rose 0.6% to 94.34, earlier touching a record high of 95.77. KLA stock was up 1.8% to 68.73.Editor's Note: This version corrects a misreading of Arcuri's research note as to the chances of merger approval.

Volume was tracking lighter across the board vs. the same time Friday.Steel, fiber optics and gaming software makers topped the list of gainers in the stock market today, while automakers, food and generic drug stocks lagged.Take-Two Interactive spiked nearly 5% to a new high in triple its normal trade.

900,L,"It's a paradox. The liberal media champion themselves as the most open-minded people on planet Earth who are devoted to the freedom of speech.How can intelligent people be so wrong? In reality, liberal elites have a nasty tendency to dismiss ""conservative thought"" as an oxymoron. They don't read conservative books or magazines, and they wouldn't lower themselves to watching conservatives on television. They have disdain for conservative talk radio. They're virtually illiterate on conservatives and conservatism.What happens in the event that the inclusive and tolerant elites identify some spark of conservative brain activity? They respond with journalistic censorship.This gets more interesting when a conservative book charges the left with seeking to crush conservative freedom of speech, seeing it as the quickest route to political victory. Oh, the irony!Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel has written a book called ""The Intimidation Game: How the Left Is Silencing Free Speech."" The New York Times is not under obligation to review it, nor is any conservative surprised that it won't. But it has no right to misrepresent its circulation. This is precisely what the Times is doing: playing games with sales figures to suppress Strassel's book from its best-seller list.In its first week in print Strassel's book ranked sixth on the Nielsen BookScan list of best-sellers. Somehow the Times couldn't find a space anywhere in its top 15, despite including on its list books that sold less than Strassel's did on the Nielsen list.Best-sellers beget more sales, and the New York Times is trying to thwart that possibility. Conservative authors, from Ted Cruz to David Limbaugh, have seen these games before. But this book is about suppressing free speech, so the shamelessness is even deeper.Strassel's book paints a broad picture of liberal intimidation at the highest levels. It tells the real story that the pro-Obama press refuses to report regarding the efforts of the IRS to harass Tea Party groups, deconstructing Barack Obama's fiction that this campaign was limited to a few low-level agents in Cincinnati, Ohio. It reveals how Democratic senators have misused their positions to hassle universities that offended them by employing the ""wrong"" kind of climate scientists.Here's another story the left-wing ""news"" media have refused to report: how liberal Wisconsin prosecutors used secret subpoenas and predawn raids in an attempt to criminalize some 30 conservative groups that had dared to supported Gov. Scott Walker's attempt to reform state government. Strassel also tells a sad story about how average Americans have had their cars keyed and their businesses flash-mobbed for having the temerity to support conservative ballot initiatives.The title ""An Inconvenient Truth"" was taken. But that's what Strassel does. She tells inconvenient truths that liberals want to hide -- first by refusing to report the stories and then by censoring those who do.There have been numerous books written over the years about this left-wing censorship, including last year's ""The Silencing: How the Left Is Killing Free Speech"" by Kirsten Powers and ""End of Discussion: How the Left's Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun)"" by Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson. (Like Strassel's book, neither was reviewed by the New York Times.) These tomes are a call to action.Conservatives ought not to be silent about this censorship. They need to respond to the left's effort to crush free speech with more speech designed to expose their raging and cowardly agenda.Liberal open-mindedness? There's your oxymoron.

903,L,"Display manufacturers are rapidly building production capacity to supply OLED screen smartphones. But much of the increased capacity will go to Samsung smartphones, including a possible handset with a foldable display late next year.Display makers, including Samsung and LG Display (LPL), should have enough capacity to supply about 40% of the estimated 1.5 billion smartphones to be shipped in 2017, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a research report Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Chip and display-gear maker Applied Materials recently hit a 16-year high thanks to growth areas like OLED display equipment. Read the article titled, ""Applied Materials Makes 'Compelling Case' For Growth In Chip Gear Sector.""Samsung and LG Display are on track to increase annual OLED manufacturing capacity to 750 million smartphone screens by year-end 2017, up from the current 360 million. But because of manufacturing yield losses and inefficiencies, the effective (or net) capacity will be closer to 600 million by year-end 2017, Hosseini said.Of that, Samsung will have about 95% market share to LG's 5%, Hosseini said.Much of the capacity increase will be used to meet Samsung's internal smartphone demands, including a folding-screen smartphone in the second of half 2017, he said. Apple (AAPL) and Chinese smartphone makers will get about 40% to 45% of the increase in capacity, Hosseini said.Apple is expected to use an OLED display in at least some versions of the iPhone 8, set for release in late 2017.Samsung and LG Display are both working with chip equipment makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Kateeva to improve their OLED manufacturing processes.OLED screens are thinner and more power efficient that the LCD screens in use on smartphones today. They also boast a richer color gamut and deeper blacks. Plus, OLED screens are flexible, making it possible to use curved screens.RELATED:Apple iPhone 8 Sales Seen Rising 20% Over iPhone 7Anticipation: Apple iPhone 8 Could Rain On iPhone 7 Parade

904,L,"Shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) soared Thursday on a report that the company might be acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM).NXP stock shot up as much as 19% on the stock market today, matching a 14-month high of 98.09, and ended the day up 17%, at 96.12. Qualcomm stock rose 6%, to 67.23.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. NXP Semiconductors has a market cap of more than $30 billion.San Diego-based Qualcomm has a market value of about $99 billion.A spokesman for NXP said it is company policy to never comment on rumors or speculation. Qualcomm didn't immediately return a request for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 46. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Headquartered in the Netherlands, NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Huawei, Hyundai, Nokia (NOK) and Samsung.If the NXP-Qualcomm merger occurs, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.In May, disk drive maker Western Digital completed its $19 billion acquisition of flash chip company SanDisk. On Feb. 1, the biggest chip merger ever -- biggest merger of two tech companies ever -- was completed between Avago and Broadcom (AVGO), with the $37 billion combination taking the Broadcom name but keeping the Avago AVGO stock ticker. And in December, NXP completed its own huge deal, acquiring Freescale Semiconductor in a transaction valued near $12 billion.Qualcomm has been among chip companies reportedly looking for acquisitions, with Xilinx (XLNX) among companies it reportedly had eyed.RELATED:Apple Supplier NXP Parlays Freescale M&A To Outpace IndustryBig Chip-Gear Merger Points To Chip Field's Active M&A Environment

905,L,"The Pending Home Sales Index fell for the third time in four months in August, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday, signaling weaker housing demand and tight supply.Pending-home sales fell 2.4% vs. a downwardly revised July to an index reading of 108.5. That's 0.2% below a year earlier.""An increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement.The Pending Home Sales Index tracks contract signings for existing-home sales, foreshadowing actual existing-home closings in following month or two.On Monday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 7.6% to an annual rate of 609,000, but that was much better than expected. Last week, existing-home sales and housing starts came in weaker than expected.IBD'S TAKE: There's an old saying that you should buy the worst house in a nice neighborhood. But that's not how it works with stocks. Look for the very best stocks, hopefully in top-rated groups. LGI Homes is the top rated stocks in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group. To see who the other top builders are, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Homebuilders were generally higher in early trade on the stock market today, as Wells Fargo initiated coverage on many builder stocks. But gains largely wilted amid the broader market sell-off.LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 0.4% to 36.88 after hitting 37.79 intraday. LGI Homes has rebounded off its 50-day line after finding support there in recent months.KB Home (KBH) fell 2.2% to 16.09, ending a six-session winning streak. KB Home is in a consolidation with a 16.86 potential buy point. Last week KB reported better-than-expected earnings but sales missed views.PulteGroup (PHM) fell 1.6%, Lennar (LEN) lost 2.3% and D.R. Horton (DHI) dipped 0.6%. All three are in downturns, though D.R. Horton has retaken its 200-day line.  Lennar topped EPS and revenue forecasts last week, but orders and margins raised concerns.RELATED:Lennar Rises Above Q3 Views, But Housing Data Sink SectorExisting-Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall In August To 5.33 Million Rate

906,L,"NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd began his pundit-panel segment on Sept. 4 by remarking: ""Nobody cares about the damn emails. That's what Bernie Sanders famously said. I couldn't believe when I looked at the time stamp, October of 2015. ... We are now at September of 2016. Somebody cares about them.""Apparently the political director at NBC News isn't in that ""somebody"" camp. When it comes to Clinton scandals, he has what Donald Trump calls ""low energy.""The latest CNN poll showed an honesty number that would really ruin a journalist's day. When asked whether Clinton or Trump is more trustworthy, 50% of voters picked Trump, and only 35% chose Clinton. Do the math. Over a quarter of her own voters find her deceitful!You'd never know it watching NBC. After Todd grilled vice president candidate Mike Pence that same day about Trump releasing his tax returns, Todd asked the panel, ""Don't you want to know if your president is going to use his presidency to enrich himself or not?""Trump, yes. Clinton, not so much.What were the Clintons doing during her tenure as secretary of state, and during these months of the promise of a second Clinton presidency? They released their tax returns. It's all there, in black and white. They enriched themselves for access. They peddled their influence to the highest bidder. One education magnate even paid former President Bill Clinton more than $17.6 million as ""honorary chancellor."" They've raked in enough tens of millions of dollars to make a Third World potentate green with envy.And yet, a week before that, when he was interviewing former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Todd didn't talk about the Clintons enriching themselves. He asked Plouffe, ""Why wasn't there thought of former president Bill Clinton stepping down from the (Clinton) Foundation eight years ago?""That's easy — because no one in the media would ever make such a demand of who NBC has presented as America's ""royal family."" NBC News was also a player in the enrich-the-Clintons sweepstakes, hiring their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, for $600,000 per year to be what we could call an ""honorary journalist"" on prime-time TV. (Quick. Tell us what she did to deserve that salary.)In the same vein, Hillary Clinton's media defenders are cheering that she's holding little gaggles on her press plane, as if that puts all her problems to rest. Clinton has made it her top talking point that Trump doesn't have the temperament to be president. But her very long and definitive record of lying and obfuscating and hammering cellphones to delete her scandals demands that the media question her temperament. But they won't. She expects to be honored and obeyed like a tyrant, not questioned like the leader of a democracy. And they will comply.But then, the media's general lack of interest in Clinton scandals also shows that most journalists have a ""temperament"" problem. They present themselves to the public as ornery, nonpartisan watchdogs, but in reality they're the aggressively obsequious partisans that swoon over Clinton when she buys a burrito. Is it any wonder that trust in the media is so low?

It manages health savings accounts.IBD'S TAKE: See how HealthEquity is the No. 1 stock in the health care commercial services industry group with IBD's Stock Checkup.Chinese ADRs rallied smartly at the open but were volatile, despite a lackluster performance for Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets overnight. Weibo (WB), which has been on a tear in recent weeks, was up as much as 8% at one point, but by noon it was down around 1%.

(TOL) shares climbed 0.5% to 30.90 Monday, but are still well off highs. The stock spiked 8.8% on Aug. 23, retaking its 200-day line after the builder of luxury homes reported strong earnings. Toll Bros. also benefited that day from a Commerce Department report that new-home sales soared in July to a post-recession high.Last week the National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales fell 3.2% in July to an annual rate of 5.39 million. Economists had expected a dip from June's cycle high to a 5.57 million pace. July's sales were down 1.6% vs. a year earlier.

910,L,"New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg was granted front-page real estate in the August 8 newspaper for an essay called, ""The Challenge Trump Poses to Objectivity."" As with all things revolving around this candidate, this is a Crisis demanding Deep Thinking.Rutenberg asks, ""If you're a working journalist and you believe that Donald J. Trump is a demagogue playing to the nation's worst racist and nationalistic tendencies, that he cozies up to anti-American dictators and that he would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes, how the heck are you supposed to cover him?""Answer: like a dangerous, racist demagogue.Some questions on the matter:Why wasn't the answer ""Impartiality is mandatory in political coverage""? If a reporter cannot manage this -- and some simply cannot -- then he should recuse himself from the assignment. This is first-semester journalism. Why can't that cardinal rule be followed?How is this suddenly a crisis? Trump's been campaigning for over a year. Where were all those journalists presumably struggling with this issue (Rutenberg wouldn't otherwise be writing about it) during the primaries? Answer: Trump was running against other Republicans, and that was fun. But now he's running against Hillary Clinton, and her camp is pushing this narrative, so an obedient media must project it, as it always does, which leads to the next point.How is it that in August 2016 a New York Times columnist finds himself struggling with such a crisis of objectivity and journalistic ethics when the press has broken the rules for decades? The same question could have been posed in 1964. Just substitute Barry Goldwater's name. It works perfectly. What about Ronald Reagan in 1968, 1976 and, most emphatically, 1980? Substitute the name. Or Pat Buchanan in 1992? Or Ted Cruz this year?One needn't be a conservative to suffer this treatment. Just run against a Democrat, and see what happens. Take Mitt Romney in 2012. (In fact, every Republican candidate in that race.) Bush 41. Bush 43. Even when a Republican enjoys media sympathies (John McCain and Bob Dole), come general election time all niceties go out the window.So when Rutenberg suggests that Trump is so objectionable that the conscientious, or even patriotic journalists ""would move closer than (they've) ever been to being oppositional,"" which he sees as ""uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist (he's) ever known,"" conservatives shake their heads in disbelief -- or burst out laughing.Rutenberg concluded that a ""Murrow moment"" of advocacy against Trump is required. To do less would be ""an abdication of political journalism's most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world.""Bill Clinton was surrounded by scandals -- legal, political and personal -- when he ran for president, but there was no need for a Murrow moment. Obama was surrounded by one pile of scandals when he ran in 2008, and then an even bigger, far more serious heap when he ran for re-election. No Murrow moment. And now we have Hillary Clinton, who's surrounded by the most serious political, legal and personal scandals of them all.The solution? Go after Trump.

917,L,"CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" offered a panel discussion on June 26 asking if Americans are so apathetic to the truth that our politics have entered a ""post-fact check phase."" This is a reference to Donald Trump, of course. The media believe he's a liar and gets away with it because of public apathy.What these journalists will never concede, however, is that Democrats get away with dishonesty because of their own apathy. Hillary Clinton's obscene lie about landing in sniper fire in Bosnia is a distant memory.Washington Post humorist/columnist Gene Weingarten was less than amused. Referencing the segment, he tweeted, ""Everyone associated with this needs to be fired, killed, buried in an unmarked grave.""Surely he was reacting to Trump-defending Jeffrey Lord who said, ""I honestly don't think that this fact checking business ... is anything more than, you know, one more sort of out-of-touch, elitist, media-type thing.""You can start with CNN. It has been documented countless times over the years how its fact-checking of politics has required fact-checking in return.CNN is by no means alone. This arrogance, this ""out-of-touch, elitist, media-type thing,"" also infects the liberal-media project calling itself PolitiFact. CNN interviewed PolitiFact boss Angie Drobnic Holan, who agreed in assessing last week's candidate speeches that Clinton's was more accurate than Trump's: ""Clinton is very well-prepared. She is very literal. She doesn't make unforced errors."" Like Bosnia?Let us briefly review the ratings this ""fact-checking"" project gave the candidates that week.Nine of Trump's statements were rated. There was one ""Mostly False,"" four ""False,"" three ""Pants on Fire"" and one ""True"" -- restating that Hillary-Bosnia thing. Only four of Clinton's statements were rated: two ""Mostly True,"" one ""Half True"" and one ""True.""A Clinton critic can easily shred these results. They found it ""True"" in a Clinton speech to Planned Parenthood that maternal mortality has plummeted since Roe v. Wade -- as if that's some kind of scientific principle connecting the two instead of a general advance in health care since 1973. That was a ""Mostly False.""What about Clinton's claim that Trump ""actually said, 'women should be punished for having abortions'?"" Fact is, under heavy pressure from MSNBC's Chris Matthews Trump gave the thoughtless answer -- ""there has to be some form of punishment."" But fact also is that he then almost immediately backed away, withdrawing that answer. ""Half True"" is being generous.PolitiFact avoided rating another Clinton statement altogether. In the same speech she said, ""Thank you for being there for Natarsha McQueen, who told me how Planned Parenthood caught her breast cancer when she was just 33 years old, and saved her life.""Wrong. One of the most persistent lies is that Planned Parenthood does mammograms and ""catches"" breast cancer. Planned Parenthood doctors only refer women to other people who do mammograms. Clinton tells that lie incessantly. ""Pants on Fire Lie"" puts it mildly.This is a pattern with PolitiFact. Overall, they've rated Trump ""False""/""Mostly False""/""Pants on Fire"" 77% of the time. But they've rated Clinton ""False"" and ""Mostly False"" only 26% of the time.The PolitiFact political agenda jumps off the page. On the Republican side, Sen. Ted Cruz lands on the ""False"" side 65% of the time, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 57% of the time and former Sen. Rick Santorum 55% of the time. For Democrats, President Obama is ruled false 25% of the time, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is false only 30% of the time. This is the guy who routinely says, ""the business model of Wall Street is fraud.""Then consider possible Clinton running mates. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro has 11 ratings from PolitiFact, and not a single one leans false. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has only four ratings, and again, not a single on leans false. It's not just quality of analysis. It's quantity. Cruz and Warren were both elected to the Senate in 2012. Cruz has been assessed for truth on 114 occasions by PolitiFact, but Warren has only been assessed on four? And for the record, there's no rating for Warren claiming to be part Cherokee Indian.Does this sound like a liberal, out-of-touch, elitist media thing? Jeff Lord nailed it.

"
925,L,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

926,L,"New-home sales soared past estimates in July, hitting a new post-recession high of 654,000 at an annual rate, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists were expecting 580,000. June's level was revised down slightly to 582,000.Home sales flew 31.3% above year-earlier totals, hitting the highest annual rate since October 2007, before the recession and credit crisis. At this rate, the inventory of new homes for sale would be gone in just 4.3 months. While that might push prices higher if sustained, the median sales price in July was $294,600, down 0.5% vs. a year earlier.Meanwhile, Toll Brothers (TOL) signaled improving demand in the high end of the housing market, matching earnings estimates while edging past revenue targets.Third-quarter earnings per share jumped 69% to 61 cents, as revenue rose 23.5% from a year earlier to $1.27 billion, besting the $1.25 billion estimate.Toll Bros. shares rocketed 8.8% to 31.91 in the stock market today, hitting a seven-month high. Most of the gains came after the new-home sales report. Toll spiked above its 200-day moving average, closing above that key level for the first time since early December.Several other housing stocks are performing better. LGI Homes (LGIH), PulteGroup (PHM) and KB Home (KBH) have all been consolidating in the past few weeks near recent 52-week highs. LGI Homes rose 2%, PulteGroup 2.9% and KB Home 4.9%.Housing stocks, like the overall market, have been looking for direction ahead of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's Friday speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo.IBD'S TAKE: Toll Bros. is a luxury builder, but it hasn't been a premium stock lately. It's ranked 16th in the Building-Residential/Commercial group, struggling to break out of a downturn. To see who the real leaders are in the group, based on company fundamentals and share price performance, visit IBD Stock CheckupToll Brothers said that its average price of homes delivered was $843,000, compared to $724,000 in the year-earlier quarter. But in the current quarter, the builder expects an average price between $815,000 and $835,000.Citing ""a shift in its mix of deliveries,"" the company said it expects its adjusted gross margin to be 25.6% to 25.8% of revenues, which is 30 basis points below the midpoint of its previous guidance.But the dip in average selling price and margins may be short-lived. The company noted that its backlog of $4.37 billion and 5,181 units rose 19% in dollars and 17% in units from a year ago. The average price of homes in backlog was $844,000, compared to $829,000 at fiscal 2015's third-quarter end.The company signaled plenty of room for expansion: ""During the third quarter, we purchased 3,494 lots for an aggregate purchase price of $459.2 million and also placed 4,695 lots under option. We ended this quarter with approximately 48,700 lots owned and optioned, compared to 45,400 last quarter.""Toll narrowed its full-year revenue target to $4.96 billion-$5.27 billion vs. $4.76 billion-$5.36 billion. That raised the midpoint slightly to $5.11 billion. Analysts expect $5.04 billion.

927,L,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports after the close of regular trade Thursday. The specialty beauty retailer has already experienced a 49% year-to-date rise in share price, so can investors expect more gains from an already high-flying stock?Earnings and revenue are each expected to rise 21% -- to $1.39 per share and $1.06 billion, respectively -- according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That would be consistent with growth rates of quarters past.Its stock has been climbing steadily higher, and Ulta shares often spike after earnings results: They rose 9.1% the day after its Q1 report in May, spiked 17.3% the session after its Q4 report in March, and popped 12.8% in one day after its Q3 results in December.The beauty-product seller fell 1.4% to 270.70 in the stock market today after hitting a record high on Friday. On Monday, Piper Jaffray raised its price target on Ulta to 290 from 250. Shares haven't dipped below their key 50-day or 200-day moving averages since the stock's post-Q4 gap-up in March.The experts on Wall Street will be particularly interested in both Ulta's loyalty program membership figures and same-store sales growth, two areas that have been strong performers.Ulta's sales at stores open for at least a year have far outpaced the broader retail landscape. The company reported 15.2% comparable-store growth in Q1, preceded sequentially by 12.5% comps in Q4 and by 12.8% comps in the quarter before that. Thursday's same-store sales will come on top of Q2 2015's 10.1% comps.By contrast, the 63 retailers that have reported earnings so far this season collectively have same-store sales growth of 1.1%, according to Retail Metrics.Driving Ulta's appeal are several factors, including an increased consumer interest in beauty products and only one major rival in the specialty beauty retail space.Beauty is the one of the fastest-growing segments in retail, NPD Group analyst Karen Grant told IBD. And ""prestige"" products -- think higher-priced products from brands like MAC and Urban Decay -- are proving to be popular, outpacing the ""mass"" or drugstore brands by sales growth in 2015.LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora is Ulta's primary competition, although the two companies differ in strategy. Sephora is a prestige-only shop, while Ulta carries both high-end labels, as well as drugstore brands such as Revlon and L'Oreal.IBD'S TAKE: It can be tough to figure out when to let go of a stock, especially when shares are climbing higher. But this profit-taking rule can help fill in the ""Missing Chapter.'' So is now a good time for investors to hop on? Or is it too late to get in on this hot retail name?Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink in a Monday note laid out the argument for Ulta's valuation.""The mega trends in beauty provide a highly compelling backdrop for growth; Ulta's position is increasingly favored among consumers and brands; and the defensibility of the model is becoming increasingly clear as the mix of prestige and mass brands coupled with a growing list of service elements is differentiated,"" she wrote.RELATED:Can Ulta Beauty And Veeva Systems Keep Win Streaks Intact?

928,L,"It's an ironclad principle. Media coverage of the quadrennial Republican and Democratic conventions is a laboratory exercise to demonstrate how shamelessly partisan our political reporters truly are.In this topsy-turvy year, it would be obvious for the media to proclaim that the Democratic convention went much more smoothly, was professionally organized and had a greater star-power presence. As usual, the Democrats squeezed a lot more free time out of the networks. Their celebrities spoke far into the 11 o'clock news hour.Trump, on the other hand, closed with a fizzle the first two nights, featuring a (boring) general and a former soap opera star.Trump did not deliver the promised hoopla, but it really made no difference. The press was just not going to project a successful convention for the GOP. It never does.It is a metaphysical truth: The networks engage in a partisan double standard. They've done it for decades.The easiest measurement is tone. Media ""analysts"" always find the Republican convention to be overflowing with acrimony -- even hatred. This year was true to form. They can't stomach the idea that someone would say mean things about Hillary Clinton.The retired anchormen came out to carp. CBS's Bob Schieffer complained Clinton had been accused of everything, including ""the diphtheria epidemic."" On NBC, Tom Brokaw lamented the GOP was trying to ""work up a big hate for Hillary."" Over on MSNBC, Chris Matthews despised Gov. Chris Christie's speech so much he called the convention a ""brewing up of almost a witch-like ritual,"" a ""festival of hating Hillary,"" tossing in adjectives like ""bloodthirsty"" and ""blood-curdling"" to describe the delegates' cheers and applause.But say something insulting about Trump and not only is the statement not negative -- it's acceptable truth-telling. During the first two days of the DNC speakers called Trump a con man: He ""cheats students, cheats investors (and) cheats workers."" He ""rejects science"" and would take America ""back to the dark days when women died in back alleys."" He promotes ""racial hatred"" and is ""making America hate again.""Hatred, anyone?Media Research Center analysts studied ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and NBC coverage from 9 p.m. till midnight on the first two nights of each convention. During the GOP convention, journalists scolded the Republicans for negativity 63 times. During the same time slot at the DNC, viewers heard only five such comments from reporters, a more than 12-to-1 advantage.The networks also betrayed their rooting interest by deciding the Republican-produced videos were untrustworthy propaganda that shouldn't be aired, while the Democrat-produced videos were fascinating entertainment. During the Republican convention, CNN only showed three Republican-made videos, none of which attacked Democrats.The Republicans' Monday-night videos attacking Democrats over the 2012 Benghazi fiasco and the Fast and Furious scandal were major presentations. CNN skipped them. But during the Democratic convention, CNN chose to air 18 of the party's scheduled videos, six times more than the GOP. The minute-to-minute count was 62 minutes for the Democrats to just 14 for the Republicans. CNN routinely showed the party-produced videos promoting star speakers, including both Obamas and both Clintons.The networks pine to invite Democrats to trash Republicans during their convention, which is just fine, except it's never the reverse. CBS aired four minutes of Hillary Clinton trashing Trump in its prime-time coverage, but it never balanced that with a Republican taking her to task in Philadelphia. MSNBC's Brian Williams promised they would balance their interviews. What was his idea of balance? They interviewed five Democrats in prime time during the GOP convention, but offered zero Republican interviews when the shoe was on the other foot.Two weeks of network coverage with this dramatic tilt underlines why the media's credibility is in the toilet. They're not even trying to be fair. They are vested entirely in the success of the Democrats.

"
931,L,"In the swing of the Trump wrecking crane, President Obama's approval ratings have risen above 50%. The media see greater appreciation for his ""competence"" in office -- but, why? In the wake of the Orlando attack it's easy to ask, ""How competent would the media have made President George W. Bush appear if an Islamic terrorist shot up a gay nightclub in Florida eight years ago?""It seemed like every piece of bad news during the Bush years was somehow Bush's fault -- and proof of his incompetence. The media's attitude toward Bush was summed up in Bill Maher's diatribe to Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show"": ""The man is a rube. He is a dolt. He is a yokel on the world stage. He is a Gilligan who cannot find his ass with two hands.""But absolutely no one in the media wonders for two seconds if Obama looks incompetent when a terrorist calls the cops to declare himself an ally of ISIS and shoots to death 49 people and wounds scores of others. Instead, the post-shooting ""news"" focused on how the Republican love of ""assault weapons"" and hatred of homosexuals are the obvious targets for blame.What of Islamic terrorism? What of Obama's incompetence -- his very real refusal to even call the threat by its name? It doesn't matter if it's San Bernardino, the Boston Marathon, Chattanooga, Benghazi or Fort Hood. No terrorist attack has ever cast the slightest shadow over this president.The same goes for hacking. When the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee computer network to gain opposition research on Donald Trump, who was blamed? The Washington Examiner wrote, ""The White House reacted ... by complaining that Republicans have blocked additional money for funds to enhance the nation's cybersecurity.""Last summer, we learned that hackers -- presumably Chinese -- breached the Obama-run Office of Personnel Management and stole data from background investigations covering 21.5 million people, including current, former and prospective federal workers.A Media Research Center study found that broadcast news networks protected the president by refusing to criticize the administration in 90.2% of cybersecurity stories (139 of 154). The sample stories included reports of serious data breaches at the OPM and IRS, theft of emails from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and top administration officials, and possible hacks of major airlines and Wall Street.Newspaper editorial pages only sometimes harshly criticized Obama on those issues. Last July, the Washington Post editorial board accused him of demonstrating ""inexcusable negligence"" on cybersecurity and being ""way too passive about China.""Why isn't this news? Network anchors like Scott Pelley of CBS suggested the cyberattack was a problem for the whole country, not just Team Obama. In an interview last August, he asked Secretary of State John Kerry: ""With all of the attacks that have come apparently from China on the U.S. government, there is a sense that the United States is unable to defend itself in the cyber world. How much concern should we have?"" Kerry said the government was ""fighting back"" against attacks daily, but the cyberworld is pretty much ""the Wild West so to speak.""Throw into this mix the scandal of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton using a very hackable private server for four years with no outbreak of competence from Obama officials. The media attitude is evidenced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who doesn't want to talk any more about those ""damn emails."" Meanwhile, no one wonders how Obama could be so cavalier about the cyberthreat she created.To the press, Obama's competence is automatically assumed. It's a given like knowing the sun will rise in the east. Part of it is the press's personal attachment to Obama, and part of it is the hidebound liberal assumption that the party that grows government the most governs best.

944,L,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday after its two-day policy meeting, as expected, and longer-term rate projections show an even slower pace of increases.Still, policymakers painted a mostly upbeat picture about the job market and overall growth and signaled that the Fed's key rate will rise before year-end.Markets have increasingly been pricing in a December hike -- currently 59% --  but have seen just a 33% chance of another hike before September 2017. Fed projection materials point to two hikes in 2017, consistent with recent comments that they would hold rates low for longer.The Fed said in its statement that policymakers decided that ""the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress.""However, three policymakers dissented from the decision, all favoring a hike now, leaving a 7-3 vote in favor of staying put.But the Fed's forecasts show policymakers expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from five at their June meeting. The estimate for the fed funds rate in 2017 has slipped to 1.1% in 2017 from a 1.6% view in June, 2018's views dropped to 1.9% from 2.4%, and the longer-run forecast is now 2.9% vs. 3%.Investors seemed pleased with the Fed's intentions, sending stocks significantly higher and the Nasdaq to an all-time best. The 10-year Treasury yield fell slightly.The Fed assessment that ""the labor market has continued to strengthen"" seems to be a little too upbeat, given some surprisingly bleak details in the August jobs report, notably that the length of the workweek had shrunk to a five-year low. The latest data from Treasury also point to a weakening in federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks.The read on household spending — ""growing strongly"" — also seems to ignore the back-to-back declines in retail sales as auto sales went into reverse. The statement does note that business investment continued to be soft.Despite the Fed's positive read on economic data and a backdrop of core inflation approaching the 2% target, policymakers clearly think that they can be very patient in hiking rates over the next couple of years with little chance of an outburst of inflation.At her post-meeting press conference, Fed chief Janet Yellen characterized current policy as only ""modestly accommodative.""Earlier, the Bank of Japan vowed to keep the 10-year Japanese government bond yield near zero. The yen initially sold off hard against the dollar, but then reversed all of its losses and more as markets signaled doubts that the latest moves would be any more successful in reviving inflation than prior ones.Japan's plight is clearly in the thinking of Yellen and other Fed doves who stress that it will be easier to tamp down inflation should it surprise to the upside than it would be to shake off a bout of deflation.""We're not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating,"" Yellen said. Meanwhile, more people are being drawn into the workforce than she had expected, giving the economy some extra running room, she said.Yellen noted that she sees the recent 180,000-per-month employment gain as unsustainably high.She also discussed commercial real estate, highlighted as an area of potential overheating by Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve. ""While valuations are high,"" Yellen said, she noted that lending standards have tightened and that debt growth was not raising red flags.So why didn't the Fed hike Wednesday? ""Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy,"" Yellen said.But she added that labor market slack is being taken up at a slower pace. And the Fed's ""cautious"" approach on rates reflects her belief that with rates near zero it would be easier to tighten quickly if necessary than to cut rates rapidly.Even though economists see a November rate hike as almost unthinkable given the presidential election just days later, Yellen stressed that the meeting would be a live one, meaning a rate move is possible.U.S. stocks opened higher on the BOJ moves as well as on strong earnings from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and FedEx (FDX), but had erased most of those gains heading into the Fed announcement at 2 p.m. ET.Among Fed-sensitive stocks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) have found support near their 50-day lines recently.JPMorgan is still up after the Fed meeting, but has pared gains. LGI Homes is nearly up 2%, close to session highs.RELATED:JPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Sag As Rates To Stay Lower For LongerThe Fed's Real Dilemma Wednesday And How It May Disappoint MarketsNote To The Fed: The Job Market Just Took A Wrong TurnBank Of Japan Keeps -0.1% Rate, Sets Bond Yield Target

945,L,"Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings per share and sales that topped analyst estimates, but many stocks in the sector fell at the open on weaker housing-start data in August.Lennar said that earnings rose 5% to $1.01 a share, topping estimates for 89 cents. Revenue rose 14% to $2.8 billion, above forecasts for $2.68 billion.The Commerce Department on Tuesday said housing starts in August fell from July to an annualized rate of 1.142 million, worse than expected.Lennar's deliveries during the quarter rose 7%, while new orders rose 8%. The company said deliveries increased in all its homebuilding segments except in Houston, which suffered from ""less demand in the higher-priced communities driven by volatility in the energy sector.""Gross margins on home sales were 22.6%, slimmer than the 24.1% a year earlier in part due to steeper land costs. Deliveries and new orders were also weaker than the 12% and 10% gains seen, respectively, in the prior two quarters.At midday, Lennar closed 3.5% lower at 43.50 in the stock market today. KB Home (KBH), which missed third-quarter sales estimates but beat on earnings after the close, ended down 2.4% but rose 5% late. LGI Homes (LGIH)  fell 1.4%, while Pulte Group (PHM) lost 2.9%. Toll Bros. (TOL) slid 1.4%.The slump reverses the gains homebuilder stocks saw on Monday, when the National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index showed that homebuilder sentiment in September was at an 11-year high.""While the housing market's recovery has continued to progress on a slow, steady and sometimes, choppy path, we have continued to manage our sales and delivery targets in the 7% - 10% range, while focusing on bottom-line profitability and balance sheet strength,"" Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said in a prepared statement.IBD'S TAKE: As the market digests mixed housing data, see which stocks in the sector could be gearing up for a breakout.KB Home earned 42 cents a share on revenue of $913.3 million. Net orders rose 16%, and deliveries grew 11%. Analysts expected earnings to jump 69% to 39 cents a share with revenue up 12% to $944.56 million.RELATED:  LGI Homes Raises Guidance As Home Prices Climb 6%LGI Homes Breaks Out; Rival Builders Near Buy Points

946,L,"Stocks closed well off session lows but slightly higher Tuesday.The Nasdaq climbed 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed with tiny gains of less than 0.1%. Volume was lighter across the board vs. the same time Monday, according to preliminary figures.Biotech, energy and transportation stocks led the upside in today's stock market action, while telecom, oil and building-related plays lagged. In economic news, August housing starts and building permits disappointed. All eyes Wednesday will be on the Fed, when its interest rate decision is due out around 2 p.m. ET. A news conference follows at 2:30 p.m. ET.Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) soared 12% to an all-time high in massive trade. Shares are 19% extended past a 17.90 cup-with-handle entry, nearing profit-taking range. The biotech, which develops injectable and inhalation drugs, will be added to the S&P SmallCap 600 index Wednesday after the close. Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), a maker of drugs to treat central nervous system disorders, pared its gain to 2% after rising as much as 5% intraday. The biotech is 6% extended from a 24.10 flat-base entry from where it broke out Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Going with the top stocks in its industry group is always a sound strategy. Find out where your biotech ranks in its group now with IBD Stock Checkup.On the IBD 50, Acacia Communications (ACIA) reversed lower for a 4% loss. Shares of the fiber-optic products maker remain well extended past a 45.85 buy point of a short IPO base cleared in July.LGI Homes (LGIH) shed nearly 2% in light trade to test its 50-day line. The stock appears to be finding support there, but it also triggered a sell signal Sept. 9 when a sharp dive erased a double-digit gain from a 36.54 buy point. Homebuilders flagged Tuesday on weak housing starts data.IBD 50 stocks on the rise included Biogen (BIIB), up 1% amid strength in the biotech sector, as the stock builds a flat base with a 333.75 buy point. The biotech group has jumped to No. 11 among IBD's 197 industry groups, from No. 38 six weeks ago.Ireland-based drugmaker Shire (SHPG) added 1.5% in healthy volume as shares cleared a 203.47 flat-base entry. While the stock is still in buy range, be extra cautious with all purchases while the market uptrend is under pressure.Besides the Fed meeting, there's little else on the economic calendar. The Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventory figures come out at 10:30 a.m. ET. General Mills (GIS), CarMax (KMX) and Red Hat (RHT) are some of the noteworthy companies reporting earnings.RELATED:Lennar Rises Above Q3 Views, But Housing Data Sinks SectorEpilepsy Drugs Fuel Huge Growth At Supernus; Pipeline Strong Too

947,L,"No. 2 chip-gear-maker Applied Materials (AMAT) reported record earnings late Thursday and fiscal Q3 sales near Wall Street's expectations, as the company's guidance handily beat views, prompting shares to rocket in after-hours trading.Applied Materials stock was up 4.5% in after-hours trading, after the chip-gear maker released its earnings report and after closing up 1.4%, at 27.68, during the regular session in the stock market today, closing just below a 14-year high touched Monday. Shares are up 48% this year, amid IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group's 15.5% rise.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Applied Materials reported $2.82 billion in sales and 50 cents earnings per share minus items, up 13% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped analysts' model for 48 cents. Sales neared the $2.84 billion forecast.Three months ago, Applied Materials' implied guidance was for $2.79 billion to $2.89 billion in sales and 46-50 cents EPS ex items.New orders jumped 26% to $3.66 billion. Its backlog of $4.95 billion rose 60% vs. the year-earlier period.Current-quarter guidance for sales to rise 15%-19% sequentially implies $3.24 billion to $3.36 billion, which would be up 39% vs. last year at the midpoint. Applied Materials' guidance crushed the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.8 billion.Applied Materials also models 61-69 cents EPS ex items, up 124% and topping analysts' views for 48 cents.Applied Materials trails only ASML (ASML) in terms of market cap in IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group.At one time, Lam Research's (LRCX) pending merger with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) appeared poised to overtake Applied Materials. Now, Applied Materials' $29.7 million value would still swallow a combined Lam-KLA by more than $4 million. ASML leads the group with a whopping $44.9 billion value.IBD'S TAKE: Lam's attempt to buy KLA is currently stalled on regulatory concerns with analysts saying earlier this month that Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron could put up an antitrust fight, pummeling the $10.6 billion merger. 
"
948,L,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) late Wednesday confirmed that it would ax thousands of jobs and reported Q4 earnings that topped views, though revenue declined 2% amid weakness in China.The computer networking leader said it will slash 5,500 positions, about 7% of its workforce, starting this quarter. Reports had anticipated as many as 14,000 job cuts.Cisco said it will target growth in security; the Internet of Things, or web-connected devices; and cloud computing. More acquisitions could be coming in growth areas, Cisco said.Under CEO Charles Robbins, who took over in July 2015, Cisco has targeted software, services and recurring revenue. On Cisco's earnings conference call with analysts, Robbins said the company will continue investing in its core business -- routing and switching gear -- while targeting growth areas.""We are working diligently on bringing innovation to our core, we're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core, bringing cloud-based management across the portfolio,"" he said. ""It's not that we're ignoring one area in favor of the other, we want to make sure our investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity.""Robbins said Cisco's job cuts are not related to its budding partnership with Sweden-based Ericsson (ERIC). There's been speculation Cisco could acquire Ericsson, though the gear maker has said that's not in the cards.Cisco said fiscal Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 7% from the year-earlier quarter to 63 cents. Revenue fell 2% to $12.6 billion. Analysts had projected EPS ex items of 60 cents, on revenue of $12.57 billion, for the quarter ended July 30.In the current quarter, Cisco forecast flat revenue of $12.5 billion, in line with views, and non-GAAP EPS of 59 cents, a penny below consensus estimates.Cisco stock was down 1% in after-hours trading, after its earnings release and confirmation of the layoff. Shares fell 1.3%, to 30.72, in Wednesday's regular session on reports it would slash 9,000 to 14,000 workers, raising questions over ""whether forward business trends are weakening,"" one analyst said. Cisco laid off some 11,000 workers between 2011 and 2014.Cisco stock touched 31.25 on Aug. 9, its highest price since November 2007.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco's stock has climbed 13% in 2016, with most gains coming after upping its dividend by 24% in February. Some high-dividend-paying stocks, such as AT&T, have edged down on speculation the Federal Reserve might hike rates this year.

949,L,"American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) beat quarterly estimates but saw comp sales cool sharply, while Children's Place (PLCE) lifted its outlook after a strong quarter.Overall retail sales were flat in July after three straight months of gains, the Commerce Department reported last week. Many retailers, restaurants and other consumer-related companies have reported sluggish demand.But some retailers are performing better than others. American Eagle and Children's Place shares are trading at multiyear and all-time highs, respectively, ahead of their earnings.Estimates: EPS to climb 23.5% to 21 cents. Sales seen up 2.9% to $820.18 million.Results: EPS jumped 35% to 23 cents while sales rose 3% to $823 million. But same-store sales only rose 3%, after rising 11% last year.American Eagle sees Q3 EPS of 40-41 cents vs. the 40 cents analysts are expecting.Last Quarter: EPS up 47% to 22 cents, as sales rose 7% to $749.4 million.Stock: American Eagle shares fell as low as 17.55 in morning trading but recovered to close down 3.3% at 18.33 on the stock market today. That's after hitting a three-year high of 19.55 on Monday. The stock, which had risen for the past eight weeks, is just below an 18.59 buy point cleared last week.Why It Matters: American Eagle, a leading teen and young adult retailer, is among a handful of apparel chains to break out in recent weeks amid a mixed consumer environment. American Eagle also may offer clues about how well the back-to-school shopping season has gone.Estimates: Analysts see a loss of 23 cents per share vs. a 33 cent per share loss in the year-earlier quarter. Sales are seen up 0.6% to $368.6 million.Results:  The retailer reported a loss of 1 cent per share and a 1.4% increase in sales  to $371.4 million. Same-store sales were up 2.4%.Children's Place raised its full year EPS outlook to $4.60-$4.70 from an earlier outlook of $4.17-$4.27. Analysts are expecting $4.26.Last Quarter: EPS up 59% to $1.32. Sales rose 4% to $419.4 million.Stock: Children's Place, a children's apparel retailer, climbed 1% to 86.69 after hitting a record 90 in early trading. On Tuesday, the stock finished the day at 85.86, up 2.7% ,closing above an 85.01 buy point in a consolidation, a bullish chart pattern. Volume was strong.Why It Matters: Like American Eagle, Children's Place offers hints about consumer spending, notably the back-to-school shopping period.IBD'S TAKE: Ross Stores and Lululemon Athletica are apparel retailers that have broken out. Is Children's Place next? Take a deep dive in this IBD Stock Analysis. Lower-ranked Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) topped quarterly estimates after the close, sending the stock up late.Urban Outfitters (URBN), another young adult apparel chain, soared 15% after better-than-expected Q2 earnings late Tuesday.Off-price apparel chain Ross Stores (ROST) reports Thursday. Peer TJX Cos. (TJX) gave cautious guidance Tuesday.Related:

950,L,"Stocks ended slightly higher Wednesday after Federal Reserve policymakers were split on the need for an interest-rate hike. Cisco Systems (CSCO) dipped 1% after the close, while NetApp (TAP) jumped 5% after reporting earnings.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2%, the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1% and the Nasdaq ended up a fraction. Volume in the stock market today was higher across the board, according to preliminary data.Stocks erased mild gains in the afternoon, after minutes from the Fed's July 27 meeting showed policymakers had greater confidence in the economic outlook, but remained reluctant to raise interest rates.Computer networking giant Cisco Systems was down about 1% after the close despite reporting higher-than-expected profit and sales for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in July. The stock dipped 1% during the regular session, ending just below a 52-week high.

951,L,"In the stock market, it's totally smart to always have an exit strategy for every stock you buy. When a stock does not behave, the exit strategy is very simple. Cut your losses short. While a 7%-8% loss is the largest you should allow, cutting your losers even more quickly is sound strategy, especially during choppy market conditions or in…

952,L,"The mass shooting in Orlando really infuriated liberals all over again about the lack of gun control -- including liberal journalists and comedians. NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt blandly promoted how ""late-night hosts have once again found themselves straddling the lines between comedians and consolers.""But they weren't consolers. They were agitators for the liberal agenda.On ""The Daily Show,"" host Trevor Noah sympathized with Obama saying, ""He's hosted 12 state dinners, but he's had to give 16 mass-shooting addresses.""And none of those apparently ever reflected badly on Obama's leadership on terrorism? Noah lectured for gun control: ""America needs to ask itself the question: Do you want to be a country that takes reasonable measures to protect its citizens, or should we tell the president to prepare speech number 17?""On NBC's ""Late Night,"" hosted by Seth Meyers, the only issue was guns: ""This was an attack on LGBT people fueled by bigotry and hatred. And the shooter was apparently inspired by ISIS, "" he acknowledged.He continued: ""But we're gonna talk about guns. Because whether the shooter was a homophobe, mentally ill, a terrorist inspired by ISIS or all three, what allowed him to kill so many people on Sunday was his gun. And that means we're likely about to enter yet another contentious national debate about gun control.""Later, Meyers lamented saying, ""When given a chance, Congress consistently chooses nothing as a course of action.""On TBS, Conan O'Brien used almost the exact same language about banning ""assault rifles"" as Hillary Clinton does on the campaign trail. He began by noting, ""I've always, always made a policy to stick to my job and keep my opinions to myself.""Don't buy that. O'Brien likes comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.He continued: ""I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle. It makes no sense to me. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life.""O'Brien can take his 10-pound pompadour to Cuba, make a communist dictatorship look colorful and lovable, and keep his opinions on their repression to himself. But conservatives and Republicans? They're like Hitler, and they like murderous assault rifles.Also on TBS, Samantha Bee echoed O'Brien, sounding like a Democrat, but with added rage: ""Sam Bee wants to take your guns away! Yes, the ones that mow down a room full of people in seconds? Yes, I do want to take those guns away. These high-capacity penis substitutes are a s***** choice for hunting and home protection, but perfect for portable mayhem.""But Bee added a layer of contempt for anyone who offered prayers of support to the victims and their families: ""The biggest, most helpful thing you can do to ensure this never happens again is sit quietly in a room with your eyes closed, talking to nobody.""She concluded her rant with a mean-spirited prayer of her own: ""I'm just going to pray. Are you there, God? It's me, Sam. Please, bless the victims and their friends and families in their time of unspeakable pain. Give us the courage to say no more, and while you're at it, please send the NRA a plague of boils. Amen.""If Lester Holt thinks Samantha Bee is a ""consoler,"" he's clearly in denial about her weekly rage-fest.These comedians are all angry that their editorials never seem to make a dent, in part because they cannot acknowledge that their ""solutions"" (like background checks) never seem to be the answer to these unfolding mass-shooting horrors.

954,L,"Off-price earnings are scheduled for this week, with TJX (TJX) reporting early Tuesday, and off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) slated to disclose results after the close on Thursday.A number of department-store retailers surprised the Street last week with earnings and revenue beats, so what can investors expect from the two major off-price stocks?The parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods, TJX is expected to earn 81 cents in per-share profit, a 1% gain from the prior year. Revenue is seen growing nearly 7% to $7.85 billion.IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which includes TJX, Ross Stores, Gap, Foot Locker (FL) and others, has been on a four-session win streak, collectively rising 4% since last Tuesday.While the off-price sector has generally been outperforming the broader bricks-and-mortar retail space, the Retail-Department Stores group is up 19% over the same time frame, on the backs of well-received results from Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) last week. Nordstrom did well on its off-price Nordstrom Rack stores.TJX shares briefly popped out of buy territory earlier Monday but are now back in the zone, dipping 0.1% to 82.77 by the close. The stock had broken out of a flat base with 79.30 entry point in mid-July.IBD'S TAKE: Several companies set to report this week are near buy points. For more on those stocks, read IBD's Investing Action Plan for Tuesday.Meanwhile: Ross Stores, which also operates DD's Discounts, is expected to grow per-share earnings by 6% to 67 cents on a 5% sales rise to $3.1 billion.Shares hit buy range in late July after building a 4-months-long flat base with 59.78 entry. But the stock is slightly overextended now past the range's 62.77 ceiling, closing at 63.22 on Monday.Among other retailers reporting this week: Gap (GPS), Urban Outfitters (URBN), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB).

955,L,"Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron will likely mount a regulatory attack on Lam Research's (LRCX) $10.6 billion bid to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but that's only if U.S. regulators don't kill the deal that would unite two of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, analysts said Thursday.KLA stock fell 2.8% to 67.51 in the the stock market today after toppling 10% on Wednesday when Lam said that regulatory hurdles in South Korea, China and/or Japan might extend the merger's close beyond the Oct. 20 deadline.Lam stock fell 4.5% Wednesday, and closed down 0.25% to 88.89. Shares are 6% extended from an 83.93 entry point achieved June 2. KLA stock, on the other hand, is down more than 8%, in a sell zone, from a 73.69 buy point hit June 20.The Lam-KLA merger has been riddled with antitrust concerns since its announcement last October. This is the third time the deal has been delayed, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research report Thursday.Shah downgraded Lam stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 85 from 95.IBD'S TAKE: Lam stock has a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs in the top 10% of all stocks. KLA stock trails with a CR of 84.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA, likely over antitrust issues.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $25 billion market cap, trailing leaders ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) with $46.9 billion and $29 billion, respectively. The duo would have 21% market share and be No. 1 or No. 2 in three out of four major manufacturing process steps.""This announcement reinforces a growing trend of skepticism from the DOJ that merger remedies will be sufficient to prevent higher prices,"" Shah wrote. ""Recent examples include Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), Sysco Foods (SYY)-US Foods (USFD) and Albertsons-Safeway.""Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire noted KLA could ask Lam for more money or terminate the deal. Unlike Applied Materials abandoning its bid on Tokyo Electron in the face of antitrust concerns, Lam can't easily walk away from KLA.And foreign regulators are just as apt as U.S. regulators to question the antitrust angle, Maire wrote in a research note.""We are sure that Samsung is pushing Korean regulators for two pounds of flesh,"" he wrote. ""And Japanese regulators are probably well aware of the 'fox guarding the hen house' problem from both Tokyo Electron and Hitachi.""

The ETF sits just below its 52-week high of 45.90.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), the largest exchange traded fund holding gold stocks, popped as much as 1.8% to 31.79, retaking the 52-week high of 31.79 set in Thursday's session.Spot gold's price was up 1.1% at $1,352.51 an ounce at around 10:30 a.m. ET.Retail data pushed the dollar lower, bolstering the price of gold. An official report showed retail sales were flat in July. Consumer confidence for August also came in below expectations. The data suggest consumer momentum -- a recent pocket of relative strength -- could be waning and impact the Fed's next interest rate move.Higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, a nonyielding haven asset.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC countries are continuing to produce at peak levels and lack of unanimity on a production freeze among cartel members could keep prices volatile in the near term.MLP funds also made a sturdy advance Friday as major oil producers opened the door to possible action on stabilizing crude prices. WTI crude futures traded up 1% at 43.92 a barrel at 10:47 a.m. ET.Alerian MLP (AMLP) swung 0.7% higher to 12.69.

958,L,"For more than a year, the cable news networks have feasted on Donald Trump, covering him live, day after day, for hours and hours. Republican contenders couldn't hope to get a fraction of his TV time. Now that Trump has secured the Republican nomination, is it possible that the networks will ""suddenly"" lose interest in every Trump speech?On successive days, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump gave speeches at the Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention. This is usually a greater test for Democratic candidates, since they have a liberal base full of ""peacemakers"" and Pentagon-haters.On July 25, Clinton spoke, followed by Trump the following day. But no one can figure out how CNN would define one as a big, breaking-news event and the other as news equivalent of a bathroom break. CNN aired the entire Clinton speech -- 19 minutes and 20 seconds -- live and uninterrupted in the 11 a.m. hour (Eastern time). The next day, CNN failed to air a single second of Trump's VFW speech live.After Clinton spoke, CNN anchor John Berman summarized her theme: ""It started out sober and subtle. But by the end, it was flat-out trolling Donald Trump, though not by name,"" with statements like ""I don't understand who people who trash-talk America.""The next day, morning anchor Carol Costello said that Trump was in North Carolina, saying, ""We'll take you there, next."" But all viewers saw was CNN reporter Sara Murray, their reporter on the Trump beat, briefly guessing about what Trump was saying inside.Tough criticism of Clinton on Benghazi and the Obama record on veterans' health? Not news. What were they doing instead during that hour?Before Trump spoke, CNN chose to offer 2 minutes and 23 seconds of live coverage to a Bernie Sanders speech to Democratic delegates from Wisconsin at the Democratic National Convention. Just about 20 minutes later, CNN also aired another minute and 19 seconds of the socialist's speech to Democratic delegates from California. His campaign was over. He was trying to get his followers into the Clinton tent. That noise was still airing on CNN as Trump's speech began.Instead of offering live coverage of Trump's VFW speech, Costello gave more time to Trump's opponents while he was talking. She promoted how Democrats are exploiting Trump's coarse mockery of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovalesky to raise money. She brought on former Rep. Tony Coelho and threw a softball. ""Tell me about the fundraising off of that Donald Trump moment in the disabled community?"" she said.Coelho gushed: ""With this situation, Donald Trump has insulted us. He has given us an opportunity to be aggressively for Hillary ... this gives us a moment to go for it in fundraising, Facebook, everything that we're doing.""How partisan did CNN look? It's this bad: MSNBC, the ""Lean Forward"" network, gave Trump's speech almost 5 minutes of live coverage -- compared to 14 minutes and 41 seconds of live coverage of Clinton's speech. Fox News carried all 24 minutes and 37 seconds of Trump's speech. But Fox also awarded more time to Clinton's speech than MSNBC did -- 16 minutes and 43 seconds.The Republicans who thought Trump was some sort of specially weaponized candidate against the Democrats because the TV networks could not possibly skip his live events may find themselves very disappointed. CNN's indefensible ""news"" judgment on the VFW speeches suggests that this highly anticipated publicity spigot is going to be turned off now that Trump's opponent is Hillary Clinton, and not other Republicans.

960,L,"Stocks saw their early modest gains fizzle on Thursday as oil prices tumbled, but semiconductor and select software stocks helped prop up the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Facebook was trying hard to reclaim its key 50-day moving average, an important step in setting up a re-breakout past a 117.09 entry.The Nasdaq composite was flat, briefly turning negative after erasing all of its early 0.6% gain. The Nasdaq rallied nearly 0.8% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 let an opening 0.4% gain disappear into a 0.3% decline; the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.3%.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, gained 1.1%. Helping the cause was Taiwan's Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO), which burst ahead nearly 6% to 50.60 after preannouncing strong quarterly results. Volume is running more than seven times its usual pace; Silicon Motion's 50-day average volume is 487,000 shares. Big price gains in big volume show the footprints of large institutional investors buying shares.The stock recently weathered a third pullback to the 10-week moving average with strength and is now up nearly 49% from a 33.87 cup-with-handle entry point. It makes sense to take at least partial gains in a great stock on the way up, especially in a choppy market like the one investors are facing in 2016.The small-cap play is seen growing earnings per share 30% this year and 17% in 2017.Speaking of choppy markets, Facebook (FB) too has not been immune. The mega-cap social network, down nearly 1% to 115.60, flopped in its latest breakout from a 117.09 cup-with-handle entry. The gain from the move that began on April 28 was a measly 3.4% before the stock reversed and sank all the way down to 108.23 on June 27, the second trading session following Britain's shock decision to leave the EU.Early today, however, the shares rallied smartly and were trying to lift back above that 117.09 entry and their 50-day moving average.Overall, Facebook's action remains sound since its initial breakout from a long double-bottom base at 29.17 in the week ended July 26, 2013. IBD Leaderboard noted the breakout at the time, as the company surprised Wall Street with strong earnings and revenue stemming from its successful strategy in developing mobile ads.On Thursday, investors may have reacted to reports saying Facebook is facing a lawsuit from the IRS over its transfer of company assets to Ireland, a well-known haven for corporations seeking lower taxes.Wall Street sees Facebook increasing its Q2 earnings 62% to 81 cents a share on a 48% leap in revenue to $6 billion. It's grown the top line 39%, 41%, 52% and 52% vs. year-earlier levels in the prior four quarters, respectively. Pretax margin of 55.6% and ROE of 16.2% in 2015 also justify the stock's Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity Rating of A from IBD Stock Checkup.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, software plays Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Paycom Software (PAYC) rallied nearly 4% and more than 1%, respectively.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 4% to 31.86 in heavy trade. The Texas-based homebuilder said it closed on 355 homes in June, up 7.3%, as home closings hit a record of 1,128 in Q2. The June figure represented a slowdown from the heady 29.4% increase in home closings (to 1,972) during the first half of the year.The small-cap stock, which gets a No. 2 ranking within the IBD 50, is still crafting the right side of a new base. Keep in mind that the current base is unusually deep, with a 48% drop from head to toe.Plus, with a market cap of just $648 million, LGI swings harder on a day-to-day basis than do other stocks in the IBD 50. However, its 0.27 alpha score affirms its ability to beat the market. An alpha score, seen in charts on MarketSmith, of more than 0.10 is generally a good sign, as it means a stock is able to rise 0.1% in price if the S&P 500 trades flat.As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points. However, keep in mind that the market has rallied for an unusually long time since its major bottom in March 2009. Gains in most stocks should generally be taken more quickly.Is your stock best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

961,L,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
962,L,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

963,L,"Emmanuel Faber's first big move as Danone's chief, the $10 billion takeover of WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), is a foray into soy milk, protein shakes and kale aimed at kickstarting growth at the French yogurt maker grappling with a drop in dairy consumption.The Paris-based producer of Actimel drinks and Evian bottled water agreed to buy the U.S. company for $56.25 a share in cash, acquiring leadership in the burgeoning natural and organic food sector through its biggest acquisition in almost a decade.After spending his first year trying to revive sluggish sales in Danone's core European dairy segment, Faber is now expanding his portfolio to include a broad range of faster-growing, higher-margin items like the Silk brand soy beverage, cashew milk and soy yogurts that cater to more affluent and health-conscious consumers. The agreement is a victory for Douglas L. Braunstein and James C. Woolery, former JPMorgan Chase (JPM) bankers, who prodded WhiteWave to consider a sale through their investment fund.""The purchase will allow us to double the size of our U.S. business and become the world leader in organic,"" Faber, who joined Danone in 1997 and became CEO in October 2014, said on a conference call with journalists.WhiteWave soared 19.8% to $56.80 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened on the stock market today. Danone jumped 3.9% to 65.76 euros at 1 p.m. in Paris.IBD'S TAKE: WhiteWave shares were breaking out of an 11-month base before the Danone takeover bid. But it's only rated No. 4 in its industry group. Find out who the leaders are in the IBD Stock Checkup.The acquisition would make Danone the global leader in fresh dairy and health-food brands including Horizon milk, Wallaby Organic yogurt and Earthbound Farm packaged salads as consumers increasingly shun processed foods perceived as unhealthy. The deal is the second potential takeover in the food industry in recent weeks, following the Mondelez International (MDLZ) advance towards Hershey (HSY), which the chocolate maker snubbed. Both of those deals aim to beef up the acquirer's presence in the U.S.In recent years, dairy milk's reputation as nature's perfect food has suffered as consumers question its nutritional merits as well as the environmental costs and treatment of animals housed at big industrial farms. The U.S. organic-food market expanded 11% in 2015 to $43 billion, while the overall food industry grew 3.3%, according to the Organic Trade Association.Unit sales in Danone's fresh-dairy business have fallen for two years straight, weighed down by a slump in Brazil and declining demand in Russia and Europe.""The key question to our mind is the real strength of the WhiteWave brands,"" wrote Jeff Stent, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. ""To what extent has WhiteWave's success been less about the brands and more about first-mover advantage in a high-growth category. Time will tell.""Denver-based WhiteWave began trading in 2012 after U.S. dairy company Dean Foods (DF) spun off the unit, which was its most profitable business. Investors have speculated since then that the company would become an acquisition target.Sales at  WhiteWave will increase about 11% this year, based on the average of analyst estimates, after doubling since 2010 on rising demand for more healthful beverages and food, data compiled by Bloomberg show. North America accounted for 86% of the company's $3.9 billion in revenue last year, with Europe contributing the rest.Growth like that doesn't come cheap -- Danone is paying about 26.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for WhiteWave, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's well above the median multiple of 14.8 times earnings paid by buyers in acquisitions of dairy companies over the past five years, the data show.The WhiteWave purchase, to be funded through debt, will boost results in the first year after closing, the maker of Activia yogurt said. Danone expects a $300 million boost to operating profit by 2020.Danone, which makes Oikos Greek-style yogurt, is targeting sales growth of more than 5% by 2020, with half of its business keying in on consumers seeking healthy-eating alternatives. North American sales will be 22% of Danone's total revenue after the purchase, compared with 12% now.The purchase values WhiteWave at $12.5 billion including net debt and other liabilities. The companies expect to complete the deal this year. Lazard Ltd. advised Danone, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised WhiteWave.Braunstein and Woolery announced in February that their firm, Hudson Executive Capital LP, had bought shares in six companies, including WhiteWave, with an eye to nudging them to take steps that would boost their stock prices. The investors said they wouldn't pursue proxy fights or publicly berate companies, preferring ""constructive engagement.""

964,L,"The Washington Post defined the old term ""high dudgeon"" when Donald Trump took away its press credentials for being ""phony and dishonest.""The paper triggered Trump's act with a loaded headline: ""Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting."" This could be believable, since Trump bizarrely suggested Sen. Ted Cruz's father was connected to the JFK assassination.But this time, the Post invented a story.Trump had told Fox News, ""we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or he's got something else in mind."" He again blasted Obama for refusing to use the words ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" suggesting he might have a dangerous softness toward radical Islam.To our pro-Obama press that was a nasty slur. But aren't these the same journalists who constantly suggested that President George W. Bush's war on terrorism wasn't tough or smart and only aided the terrorist cause?Whether or not you can support Trump, it's glaringly obvious that in this year of the presidential election, the Washington Post is out to destroy him. If Trump were any other Republican, it would be the same. The Post self-righteously presents itself as democracy's handmaiden.It published an editorial written by the editorial board on the evening of June 13 titled ""Donald Trump's assault on our values."" The unnamed writers lamented Trump's post-Orlando speech. Trump ""took a victory lap, hinted darkly that President Obama is an enemy of the nation, libeled American Muslims and, in grotesque punctuation, finished up with a vindictive attack on the media.""And then they added: ""Mr. Trump capped a day of assaulting fundamental liberal democratic values by announcing he would ban Post reporters from covering his campaign events. If this is his inclination now, imagine how he might wield the powers of the presidency.""Many imagine Trump as a wonderful breath of fresh air, refusing to indulge the arrogant elites in the press.The Post did not publish a huffy editorial last summer when the Clinton campaign banned right-leaning reporter David Martosko of the Britain's Daily Mail from its print pool. And the Post has not expressed any editorial-page outrage as the Obama administration has routinely insulted and avoided Fox News and said it is ""not a news organization.""No editorial was published when reporters from three McCain-endorsing papers -- the Washington Times, the New York Post and The Dallas Morning News -- were kicked off Obama's campaign plane days before the 2008 election to make room for reporters from the black-oriented magazines Ebony, Essence Magazine and Jet. The Washington Post only published a brief news item headlined ""Reporter Off Obama Plane: Times Editor Squawks.""But when Trump does this there is no ""squawking""; there is sanctimony. ""Donald Trump's decision to revoke the Washington Post's press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,"" huffed the Post's Executive Editor Martin Baron. ""The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along -- honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically and unflinchingly.""The Post is never more phony and dishonest than when it claims it is utterly ""unflinching."" In 2012, the paper trashed Mitt Romney on the front page for an alleged bullying incident regarding a classmate's haircut in high school in 1965. But the idea of the Post ever ""unflinchingly"" covering Obama is a sick joke.The Post just acquired its first interview with Hillary Clinton since she launched her presidential campaign -- right at the moment she became the first female presumptive nominee of a major party. This is how ""unflinchingly"" reporter Anne Gearan began the 10-minute interview the Post was granted. She asked, ""What will you remember most and if you've thought about it, what do you think you'll tell (granddaughter) Charlotte about last night when she's old enough to hear about it from you?""Dear Washington Post: Please get over yourself and your completely inaccurate self-image as the essence of fairness, accuracy and nonpartisanship.

Volume in the stock market today was running below's Friday's pace.Japan's market was already closed when the U.S. jobs report was released before Friday's market open in New York. While the late cheers from Japan did little for the U.S. stock indexes, Japanese stocks trading in the U.S. did well. Among the 31 Japan American Depositary Receipts in IBD's database, 5 rose for every 1 that fell.A handful of top-rated U.S. stocks showed good follow-up action from recent breakouts. Mortgage insurance provider Essent Group (ESNT) gapped up 2.5% Monday in brisk volume, padding gains from its breakout Thursday.Chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) popped 1.6% in strong volume, building on Wednesday's retaking of a 21.08 buy point. MaxLinear reports earnings after the close today.

967,L,"Know what you own. Look under the hood. Look before you leap. There's a reason why these catchphrases are so beloved among ETF and mutual fund investing experts.Not being familiar with the stocks that underlie your exchange traded fund is sort of like building your house without knowing whether the foundation is rock or sand. It's the prettiest little thing that ever was until -- ka-boom. Stocks are the very foundation of funds.Let's take a look at the top-rated IBD stocks gearing to report this week, and the funds holding them that could benefit if these market-leading companies make big moves on the stock market today or in the days to follow.Which of these do you own?But are there ETFs benefiting from the tantalizing moves being made by Inphi and MaxLinear -- the most highly rated stocks in the fabless semiconductor industry group. The group itself earns a high current ranking from IBD.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD), which skews toward smaller-cap companies, holds both stocks. But it also holds some large caps, such as Nvidia (NVDA), another best-ranked stock in this industry group.XSD is trading near a 52-week high as the chip industry gets its groove back after the rocky start to 2016. Its Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating of 83 shows it's outperforming 83% of all stocks and ETFs on the market.First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity (CIBR) and PureFunds ISE Cyber Security (HACK) both have a sizable weighting in this Israeli company.

968,L,"The radical leftist collective known as WikiLeaks tried to ruin the Democratic convention by posting a trove of Democratic National Committee emails that easily proved that party leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her staff shunned neutrality in favor of pushing Hillary Clinton's nomination. The Bernie Sanders socialists were enraged, their suspicions confirmed.The media paid some attention to that, especially when Schultz was quickly ousted from her job. Guess what else was confirmed, which the media largely skipped over? The evidence in the emails that revealed great chumminess and coordination between Democrats and the supposedly ""objective"" national press.You really don't need an email collection to know this. After all, NBC ""News"" hired Chelsea Clinton for $600,000 a year to make some of the most sleep-inducing ""happy news"" stories to ever air on television. She was producing stories less than once a month, or more than $50,000 a pop.In February, Gawker made a Freedom of Information Act request for government emails from Hillary Clinton's PR aide Philippe Reines. The disclosed emails exposed Politico big-foot Mike Allen. He offered a cozy Politico chat with Chelsea Clinton: ""No one besides me would ask her a question, and you and I would agree on them precisely in advance."" When exposed, Allen spun the offer as ""clumsy.""Well, the latest emails demonstrate Politico is still making a mockery of journalistic ""independence."" We now learn that ""reporter"" Ken Vogel sent a story on Clinton fundraising to DNC national press secretary Mark Paustenbach for a pre-publication review. Now, checking for confirmation of some numbers or confirming a quote — that's OK. But the entire story? That is journalistic malpractice. The Democrats have Politico on a leash.Reporters try to present a friendly face to most of their subjects, but they don't always boast, ""Hey, you'll like this story I did."" That's what happened with Juliet Eilperin, White House bureau chief for The Washington Post. She sent an email to Paustenbach cooing, ""Dear Mark, I think you all will be totally fine with it. Thanks again for all your help. Best, Juliet."" So the DNC gives blessings now? The front-page story was headlined: ""Obama, who once stood as party outsider, now works to strengthen Democrats."" The story wasn't as bad as a 2014 front-page puff piece from Eilperin touting how the Obama White House has changed the junk-food culture: ""Calorie counts and hummus with vegetables are in."" You don't need an email to see the chumminess.CNN commentator Maria Cardona is identified on air as a Democrat, but the emails show that disclosure is a little incomplete. In emailed exchanges with DNC spinners, Cardona repeatedly asked how to perfect an op-ed for CNN.com. Collusion? Liberals will probably see no conflict of interest. Now remember how many fits the liberals have thrown over CNN in-house Trump analyst Corey Lewandowski still getting checks from The Donald.Emails also show Wasserman Schultz yelling at reporters like they were servants -- and well, the media coverage can leave that impression. She titled an email to NBC's Chuck Todd ""Chuck, This Must Stop"" when Mika Brzezinski called for her to resign on ""Morning Joe."" DNC aides tried to arrange a meeting between the warring parties, but Todd replied, ""Between us, do you think that's a good idea?"" Wasserman Schultz scuttled it, wondering if Brzezinski ""even matters, to be frank."" Ouch.The primary reason the media would skip covering their own lack of independence is obvious. The public already believes they aggressively favor one side in our political debates. Why put a spotlight on your problem? Transparency is a media buzzword, but it never applies to their own partisan games.

969,L,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring component suppliers for price discounts, says RBC Capital Markets.""We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign-exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own P&L heading into the iPhone 7 ramps,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday.As a result, Apple could see upside to its gross profit margin, which it guided as flat for the September quarter, he said.Some Apple suppliers could see downside to their earnings, especially where multiple vendors supply the same component, he said.Single-source suppliers to Apple should be more resilient, Daryanani said. They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

970,L,"According to the U.N., the happiest country in the world (excluding Disneyland, which isn't a sovereign state) is the tiny Scandinavian country of Denmark. Norway and Sweden are close behind.Now, I've been to these places and they weren't the happiest places I've ever visited, but they do have enormous social-welfare networks and embrace many socialistic practices.Do these socialistic practices make Scandinavian people happy, or is there something about Scandinavians that allows socialistic practices to work?Scandinavian countries are socialistic, rather than socialist, because all maintain private ownership of productive assets. They all have high income tax rates, around 50-60% today, to promote massive social spending, but they aren't truly socialist.These countries share a number of characteristics. They're small, relatively homogeneous, have long dark winters and are all European. In addition to this they share an ethic. Scandinavians are taught from birth that they, as individuals, are in no way special. They are taught to believe they are inferior to society.  Scandinavians have a name for this: ""the law of Jante,"" or Janteloven.Janteloven has 10 commandments:In the U.S., teachers would be fired for teaching students Janteloven's tenets. My personal view is that Janteloven diminishes the individual, which I don't like, but this philosophy is shared among Scandinavians, and it has some positive effects. Scandinavians are notoriously polite and self-deprecating.Janteloven is innate for Scandinavians, so it makes sense they'd tolerate socialism better than others. Subjugating their needs and desires to the rest of society is natural and might be the reason that socialism did relatively little harm to Scandinavian societies. Janteloven also might have protected the Scandinavian people from pain and deprivations suffered by the populations of other countries trying to achieve socialism.Sweden, the most populous of the Scandinavian countries, is an example. Sweden purposefully tried to achieve socialism in the 1970s, with 85% tax rates and formal laws aimed at redistributing ownership.When Sweden raised taxes, it had a problem. Sweden in the 1970s only had 8 million citizens. Among these 8 million souls were some highly talented people. Sweden had the world’s best tennis player, Bjorn Borg, and the world’s top rock band, Abba.These, and other top-performing individuals, left the country. They moved to Spain or Monaco, where taxes were lower and the winters were milder.In other socialist experiments, the political elite might have closed the borders to keep individuals from leaving, like the USSR with its iron curtain. To their credit, the political elite in Sweden did not build walls and suspend democracy to entrench their rule.Is this perhaps the good side of Janteloven? Even the political elite felt a duty to put society ahead of their own self-interests. Or perhaps it's because Sweden is small enough that the political elite couldn't distance themselves from their fellow citizens.Either way, rather than clamping down, Sweden’s political elite moderated their stances, leaving in place some socialistic practices, but lowering tax rates and allowing private production and free markets to continue to exist. Sweden got right up to the edge of becoming a truly socialist state, and they permanently damaged their society by driving off their most successful individuals, but they recovered, and managed to walk themselves back from the edge.By comparison, Cambodia, a country of 8 million people like Sweden, tried to achieve ""agrarian socialism"" in 1975. They lacked Sweden's homogeneity, democratic tradition and Janteloven. The resulting deprivations and genocide killed one in four Cambodians before it was over.Losing Bjorn Borg and Abba was sad, but much better than mass starvation and genocide. Sweden certainly deserves credit for its relative success, and they do enjoy a large social safety net as a result of their socialist flirtation.Are Scandinavian countries the happiest countries in the world, as the U.N. study found? The U.N. study placed great weight on the social safety net. Anyone requiring a big safety net will be happy in Scandinavia. The rest of us, maybe not.

One industry was thoroughly embarrassed: the media-elite ""fact-checker"" websites and projects, from PolitiFact to FactCheck.org to The Washington Post's Fact Checker column.These so-called guardians of truth felt forced to revise and upgrade their ""Pinocchio"" counts to reflect the  fact  that so many pivotal things Clinton had claimed about her emails turned out to be falsehoods. It's all well and good that they had to change their rulings, but how effective were these watchdogs in the first place?James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal describes the problem well: ""Frequently they accuse politicians of dishonesty because the journalists favor a different interpretation of facts that are not in dispute. Sometimes their 'rulings' are mere opinions on matters about which they do not know the facts, or that are not factual questions at all.""This was seriously underlined on the first night of the Republican National Convention. Patricia Smith -- the mother of Sean Smith, who died in the terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012 -- gave an impassioned speech, tearing into Clinton for lying. ""For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton. I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.""This could not stand. PolitiFact put a picture of this angry mother on their home page with the headline ""Checking Patricia Smith's claims about Clinton and Benghazi."" The suggestion? Smith probably told some whoppers on the floor in Cleveland.But the article that followed was, to borrow from Taranto, ""mere opinions on matters about which they do not know the facts."" PolitiFact creator Bill Adair wrote, ""We can't put Smith's claims on the Truth-O-Meter. But here, we'll lay out the case for and against the allegations against Clinton and let readers come to their own conclusion.""When the review of what the survivors of the four men lost in Benghazi said was finished, PolitiFact merely threw up its hands, claiming that none of these grieving relatives can really be trusted as reliable providers of fact.""It is impossible to know with certainty what Clinton told these families in brief conversations at a private reception only three days after Benghazi. Some, but not all, family members who have spoken to the media said Clinton mentioned a video or protests in their meeting. Some said she didn't mention a video. Clinton says she did not.""To Politi-""Fact,"" Clinton's record of lying about her server doesn't tilt the scales of credibility. In another article on Monday night, the website suggested grieving relatives might have ""fuzzy"" memories. Adair even suggested that even if Clinton was incorrect, she might not have been lying: ""If she did say something about the video, would it have been an intentional lie? It's very possible that this is one of the many conflicting pieces of intelligence that the administration was working with at the time.""Adair claimed no one can really claim Clinton lied: ""There simply is not enough concrete information in the public domain for Rubio or anyone to claim as fact that Clinton did or did not lie to the Benghazi families.""Adair and his ilk aren't fact-checking in any way. They're masquerading in fact-checker costumes to engage in shameless speculation, blather and spin favoring democrats.

976,L,"It's maddening to watch a movie trailer resplendent with engrossing and alluring screenshots projecting a terrific flick, only to learn after paying the price of admission that you'd watched the totality of the movie's value. That's not misleading; it's good advertising.But sometimes movie studios are just plain guilty of false advertising.The new movie ""Me Before You"" looks to be an inspirational love story. A lower-class woman in England is hired to take care of a young man who recently became a quadriplegic after being hit by a car. He inspires her to live a fuller life; she inspires him to find the joys he can still realize from his wheelchair.That's the commercial, but that's not the actual plot. Spoiler alert: This isn't a love story; it's a story of a man's self-love leading to assisted suicide. Girl meets boy, girl falls in love with boy, girl holds boy's hand as he kills himself.As Eric Henderson wrote in Slant Magazine, ""'Me Before You' is some kind of twisted reversal of those expectations, punking its impressionable audience into believing the lie and then punishing them for their foolishness.""Before the accident, this man was impossibly wealthy, handsome, debonair and athletic. And then came tragedy, and he couldn't accept his new situation. He could only pine hopelessly for the ""old me."" The title is very apt. He puts himself before everyone else but imagines his death is a grand act of selflessness.Advocates for the disabled have been revolted by the plot, which implies that life really isn't worth living from a wheelchair. ""Make no mistake: Quadriplegia is hard, and it can be tempting to give up,"" wrote Ben Mattlin in the Chicago Tribune. ""It's a good thing I'm positively bursting with self-confidence and know I do want my life to continue. But how many of those who are struggling to maintain self-esteem, who feel unsure of their right to exist, possess the courage and sheer chutzpah to withstand the invidious message that they're better off dead?""Mattlin wrote that what he fears about the spread of euthanasia isn't the ""angel of mercy"" who pulls the plug at the hospital, or the HMO that declines to pay for medications. He fears what happens to the newly disabled person ""who will be unduly seduced into relieving their relatives -- and themselves -- of the burden of living with a chronic condition"" by movies like this one. It ""romanticizes and glamorizes an early exit for those who already feel marginalized, who feel they are living on borrowed time.""The so-called ""right to die"" movement never takes responsibility for its very real and very dangerous ethics slippery slope, building a cultural expectation that ""useless"" people will have the dignity to remove their burden from our lives. They're now trying to invent a new word to sell it: ""dignicide.""Catholic News Agency blogger Jenny Uebbing pleaded that ""Telling clinically depressed, chronically ill and paralyzed people that their lives are not worth living is a tragedy."" She recalled Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning movie ""Million Dollar Baby,"" in which a ""gruff but well-meaning"" trainer grants a paralyzed female boxer her wish with a fatal shot of adrenaline. It ""sent a depressing message about the value of an elite athlete's life post-major-trauma, but the confused message of 'loving someone enough to kill them' at least wasn't mixed in with romantic love.""For the opposing point of view, see Richard Lawson, the film critic in the appropriately named magazine Vanity Fair. He argued that ""Me Before You"" ""approaches this thorny issue with an honorable maturity and forthrightness"" and praised it for ""giving us something cozy and romantic -- and, in its own weird way, aspirational.""Suicide is an aspiration? This is the siren song of the culture of death.

The assets include over 500 issued and pending patents around the world. The purchase price was about $96 million.""We are pleased to enhance our extensive key patents in phosphorescent materials with BASF's complementary OLED IP portfolio,"" Universal Display CEO Steven Abramson said in a statement. ""One of our key objectives is to develop and deliver an all-phosphorescent emissive stack. We believe that this acquisition will help further these research efforts, principally in the development of commercial blue emissive systems.""Universal Display is a leading supplier of OLED materials and technology. Its customers include Samsung, AU Optronics (AUO) and LG Display (LPL).Last Thursday, Universal Display announced an agreement to acquire Adesis, a privately held contract research organization in New Castle, Del. Adesis specializes in organic and organometallic synthetic research, development and commercialization.Universal Display is paying about $36 million in cash for Adesis.""This acquisition is part of our strategic growth plan,"" Abramson said in a separate press release. ""We believe that it will provide additional highly skilled resources to further advance our initiatives for the development and delivery of next-generation proprietary emissive material systems in the rapidly evolving OLED industry.""Needham analyst James Ricchiuti said the two deals will strengthen Universal Display's business, as the mobile phone industry accelerates adoption of OLED displays. Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be using an OLED display in its 2017 model iPhone.""We regard the acquisitions as a good use of UDC's cash that could erect additional barriers against competitors as OLED displays gain broader adoption,"" Ricchiuti said.Ricchiuti rates Universal Display stock as buy with a price target of 69. Universal Display stock closed up 1% at 66.19 on the stock market today. Its shares reached a record high of 71.46 on June 9, and it sports a strong Relative Price Strength Rating of 96, meaning it's performed among the top 4% of all stocks in the past 12 months.RELATED:Anticipation: Apple iPhone 8 Could Rain On Upcoming iPhone 7 ParadeLikely Apple OLED Display Supplier Gets Cautious Report.

980,L,"U.S. Concrete (USCR), which sells ready-mix concrete and other construction supplies, reported higher Q2 sales but missed estimates. Profit was also light.Together with other weak earnings reports from rock and sand construction aggregates companies Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), the report raises concerns about construction activity -- or at least construction stocks. All three companies cited unusually harsh weather for the downturn though, saying they expect a quick return to robust growth. U.S. Concrete's Q2 earnings per share plunged 59% to 54 cents, 41 cents below forecasts. Revenue rose 12.7% to $275.75 million. Consensus was for $294.68 million.President and CEO William Sandbrook said U.S. Concrete faced ""near historical levels of significant inclement weather in our North Texas market."" Like Vulcan and Martin Marietta, he expects results to improve in the back half of the year, saying, ""Our underlying demand trends continue to be positive.""Gross profit margin fell to 19.4% from 21.4% in Q2 2015, as higher costs offset a rise in consolidated gross profit. During the quarter, the company bought Nycon, a ready-mix concrete supplier, expanding its footprint in the New York metro area.IBD'S TAKE: Construction supplier U.S. Concrete on Thursday joined Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials, which earlier reported weak earnings. U.S. housing fundamentals remain strong though. To see ratings for these companies, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.U.S. Concrete stock fell 6.6% to 58.33 at the close, plunging below the 50-day and 100-day lines on the stock market today. U.S. Concrete had been consolidating since the end of April.Vulcan Materials edged up 9 cents to 117.70 while Martin Marietta Materials fell 0.8% to 198.47.In a related development, TopBuild (BLD), which provides insulation services to the construction industry, also came up short of forecasts. Q2 EPS rose 59% to 43 cents, 3 cents below estimates. Revenue grew 7% to $431.59 million, vs. consensus for $450 million. TopBuild shares fell 7.4% to 35.10.Also, LGI Homes (LGIH) reported a 1.7% dip in July home closings vs. a year earlier. LGI Homes, which makes entry-level homes in growth markets, saw closings rise 7% in June and 24% year to date.

982,L,"The most obvious sign of liberal media favoritism is that liberal candidates can avoid press conferences for months at a time, and the media don't complain.After the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was attacked in 2012, the media hammered Mitt Romney at a press conference for daring to criticize President Obama, and then supinely allowed Obama to avoid a press conference. He merely made a statement in the White House Rose Garden to express his sympathies and then jetted off to a fundraiser in Las Vegas.Last week, Donald Trump was accused of having a horrific and almost undemocratic attitude toward the press after a contentious press conference. Hillary Clinton avoided a press conference for six months, and the press, like a gaggle of housebroken pets, didn't really care.On June 6, former ""Meet the Press"" host David Gregory made excuses for her on CNN: ""I think she would much rather give the spotlight of negative publicity to Donald Trump, who's doing an excellent job occupying that spotlight. She'll take the hit."" As if anyone in the liberal media were hitting Clinton.He added: ""But I don't think she wants to face a series of questions and follow-up questions on the I.G. report,"" -- on her email server -- ""on the Clinton Foundation donations and the kind of unscripted nature of a press conference. She'll face those questions in the interviews that she's doing, but I think for her it feels like a more controlled environment.""But Gregory is giving his media colleagues way too much credit. Hours before, Clinton decided to allow her media servants to address her during an impromptu stop at a community center in Compton, Calif., and there weren't any ""unscripted"" questions about her scandalous behavior. These were the questions, brief and obsequious:But the Clinton-coddling prize goes to NPR reporter Tamara Keith, who uncorked this beauty: ""Last night when you took stage in Sacramento, there was a woman standing next to me who was absolutely sobbing. And, she said, 'You know, it's time. It's past time.' You see the women, you see people here. And people just come up to you, and they get tears in their eyes. Do you feel the weight of what this means for people?""The only real question here is whether Keith was describing herself. That wasn't a journalist's question. It was a fan girl's question. Clinton gave a boilerplate response about how special it is to give girls the knowledge that they, too, could be president someday.The reporters asked no questions about scandals; they asked no questions about policy. They only chatted with Clinton about the horse race and her sobbing superfans.This is the same press corps that yells at Trump, ""It seems as though you're resistant to scrutiny, the kind of scrutiny that comes with running for president of the United States?""

983,L,"Football and its most powerful organization, the National Football League, have faced a serious public relations problem regarding concussions.The NFL settled a massive class-action lawsuit brought by former players (and now, another former player is suing). Retired NFL star Junior Seau committed suicide and was later found to have shown abnormalities associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.Seau shot himself in the chest in 2012. Afterward, his family agreed to have his brain studied. Hollywood signed up Will Smith to dramatize the story of concussions in the NFL in the movie ""Concussion,"" which chided the American love of football.The NFL is ""a corporation that owns a day of the week,"" quipped Albert Brooks, playing forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht, ""the same day the church used to own.""This is a real problem for the NFL. A former NFL safety, let's call him B, had a lengthy and distinguished career. He is also a friend. We spoke with him recently about this. He told us he suffered two concussions, possibly more.""How serious is the problem?"" we asked.His answer was wholly unexpected, and jarring: ""If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have played in the NFL."" This, from a natural athlete who obviously loved his craft.Count on the flower children at National Public Radio to go over the edge with this issue. The problem isn't the size and strength, and therefore the power, of professional football players. No, it's -- ready? -- the evil game of football itself.NPR commentator Frank Deford used to love football, but now he just drops bombs on it. On Wednesday's ""Morning Edition,"" Deford's weekly commentary was titled ""What Is Football Doing To Us As A People?""He asked on air, ""So, what is football doing to us as a people? How do we explain an America that, alone in the world, so loves this savage sport?""This is your taxpayer-funded broadcasting in action: Planned Parenthood allegedly selling dead baby parts is just a ""women's health"" group aiding ""medical research,"" but the NFL is organized savagery.It's true that America loves not just the speed and grace of the game on offense, but the noisy crunch of the game on defense. Surely, the ""savage"" nature has increased over the years along with the size and speed of the players on the gridiron. But no one in America is rooting for brain injuries and suicides. It's insulting even to think this.The left has it out for professional football. Its partisans tried a few years back to give the NFL a permanent black eye with the violent off-the-field domestic violence offenses of NFL running backs Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, as if their horrible behavior is the norm in the sport.For the past 15 years, there's been an organized campaign to strip the Redskins from Washington, though it's leftists, not Native Americans, who are upset. Now, some are using the concussion controversy to talk parents out of letting their children play football altogether.Deford was encouraged into this commentary by Buffalo Bills General Manager Doug Whaley, who told a radio station, ""It's a violent game that I personally don't think humans are supposed to play.""He said: ""All I could think of was the late comedian Flip Wilson whose favorite punchline was a screech, 'The devil made me do it!' Thank you, Satan, I thought.""He finished with the same satanic shtick: ""Notwithstanding, whether the damage to the players or the pain they endure -- which I was privileged to suffer once, but for a few seconds -- we Americans will not stop adoring football. The devil must make us do it.""This is not the first time Deford has used his NPR perch to trash the game in the most self-righteous terms. In 2013, he talked up getting the kids to drop playing football: ""What we're seeing now in football is a definition of manliness that is uber-macho. To be that kind of a man, you must be mean and insensitive,"" Deford preached.He continued, saying, ""modern football is so violent, even thuggish, that it can damage your soul as well as your brain.""Once the anti-sports lecture is over, NPR is on to the next ""nonviolent"" crusade: encouraging the joys of ""gender confirmation surgery"" (don't call it breast and genital amputation) so that transgendered Americans can feel like their ""true selves.""

984,L,"As usual, everyone's talking about the rumored new iPhone. The wrinkle? They're not talking about the very next model, the iPhone 7 due out in September, but instead are looking out a distant 15 months or so ahead -- a lifetime in the tech world -- at the following iPhone.Next year's iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the most exciting smartphone release from Apple (AAPL) since the original iPhone in 2007.And for Apple that's good -- and bad.The buzz around the 2017 model iPhone is so great that it threatens to put a damper on sales of this year's model, analysts say. The iPhone 8 has been written about extensively in the tech and mainstream media, with journalists and analysts getting their information from leaks in the supply chain.""As more and more is written about the iPhone 8, the average consumer will start to become aware of what's coming from Apple,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley told IBD.People who have paid off their current iPhones ""might wait one more year for what they think is going to be a bigger release,"" timed with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, Walkley said. ""Certainly everything in the supply chain points to next year having a much more differentiated device than this next one.""Apple observers expect the iPhone 7 will be a relatively minor upgrade to the current iPhone 6S series handsets. The 7 is expected to be thinner, faster and have a better camera, but nothing too earthshaking is seen. It will look pretty much like any iPhone from the past couple of years.By contrast, the iPhone 8 could sport a radical redesign thanks to its use of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, instead of the current LCD screen.The iPhone 8 could make Apple's smartphone sexy again and prompt long lines to form outside Apple retail stores, like in the good old days.But rumors about the 8, which will be the 11th-generation iPhone, could inspire people to extend the life of their existing handsets and wait to upgrade, Wall Street analysts say. That could lead to soft sales of this fall's 10th-generation handset, the iPhone 7. And those soft sales would be on top of weaker-than-expected sales of the current iPhone 6S.One huge factor could alleviate much of this concern, though -- the way service providers are altering their business models.Apple and its carrier partners such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) probably will use the iPhone 7 launch to promote upgrade plans that let customers get new iPhones every year, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple watcher.""More and more people are going to move to that, because everybody knows that Apple does a better phone every year,"" he said.Most of the excitement over the iPhone 8 concerns its rumored use of an edgeless OLED screen. OLED displays boast richer colors, deeper blacks and a faster refresh rate than LCD screens. Since OLED screens don't have a backlight, they can be much thinner and more power efficient. Plus, OLED displays are flexible, allowing them to be used on curved screens.Mock-ups of possible iPhone 8 designs circulated by tech enthusiast websites illustrate dramatic new form factors for the device. From iPhones with secondary screens along their sides to all-glass handsets in which the display covers the entire surface of the phone, front and back.For years, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass, the Wall Street Journal reported recently.But don't put a lot of stock into those artists' conceptions of the iPhone 8, Bajarin says.""The kinds of designs you're seeing now are more pie-in-the-sky than reality,"" he said.The iPhone 8 could be so fresh-looking that it could cause new-model envy among current iPhone users, something that hasn't happened since Apple moved to larger screen sizes in 2014.One big question is whether Apple will limit the OLED-screen iPhone 8 to a premium model and keep selling LCD models as well.Another is whether any use of a curved display or wraparound screen will be truly useful or perceived as a gimmick.Apple's OLED iPhone wouldn't be the first such smartphone on the market. Samsung already uses OLED displays in its flagship Galaxy smartphones. Samsung itself, in fact, is the top maker of OLED displays, including for its TV sets, and Apple likely would have to buy its OLED screens from Samsung until other vendors could ramp up production.Sharp, Japan Display, Joled, AU Optronics (AUO) and LG Display (LPL) all plan to add either pilot or production capacity for OLED screens in 2017 or 2018. Plus, at least five Chinese companies are preparing OLED production lines.Apple enthusiasts, however, will think the OLED iPhone is a ""big deal,"" even though Samsung and others already use them, says Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates and another longtime Apple watcher.Roughly 10% of smartphones use OLED displays today, and that figure could reach 100% after 2020, Goldman Sachs said in a May 23 research report.But the OLED screen could be just one selling point of the iPhone 8. Another major change is that next year's iPhone could feature wireless charging, according to media reports. Instead of plugging in a power cord, users would place the device on a charging mat. Again, Samsung and some others, such as Motorola, already offer such a feature, but it would be another big change for the iPhone.In addition, Apple also could eliminate the physical home button with the iPhone 8. That functionality would be incorporated into the pressure-sensitive touch screen. Removing the home button would allow the display to cover more of the iPhone's front panel.For the iPhone 7, Apple is expected to eliminate the audio jack, forcing users to switch to a Bluetooth headset or a Lightning-connected headset. A rumor circulating at the Computex Taipei 2016 trade show claims that, with the iPhone 7, Apple plans to bundle a Lightning adapter with its standard EarPods headphones.With the removal of the audio jack in the iPhone 7 and wireless charging in the iPhone 8, Apple could then offer a smartphone with no holes to plug in chargers and cables. The device could be completely wire free and rely on the internet cloud for data backup.Apple shares fell 2.8% on the stock market today as Brexit fears hit worldwide.

985,L,"AT&T (T) could sell its DirecTV satellite television business in Brazil to Spain's Telefonica (TEF), speculates BTIG Research, though AT&T also has the option of picking up assets in Brazil, which has been struck by economic turmoil ahead of the Summer Olympic Games.That turmoil claimed a victim on Monday, when Brazil's fourth-biggest wireless firm, Oi (OIBR), filed for bankruptcy on Monday. What AT&T might do is getting some attention.""While AT&T has seen success in Mexico, we still believe that it would rather exit Brazil than expand its presence in that market,"" BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said in a research report Wednesday. ""That theory will be put to the test in the coming months and years as Telecom Italia looks for a buyer of its assets and pieces of Oi become available through the bankruptcy process.""We believe Telefonica Brasil could be a likely buyer of AT&T's assets in Brazil and do not think it would face major regulatory hurdles … but we do not believe Telefonica is prepared to pay a high multiple for this asset.""AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015. Outside of Mexico, Brazil is DirecTV's biggest market in Latin America.America Movil (AMX) is another big player in Brazil's telecom market.

986,L,"Apprehension that Britons will vote to secede from the European Union is exerting influence great and small in disparate corners of the U.S. equity market. Here's a map to where.A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper published late Monday showed ""Leave"" at 44% and 42% for ""Remain,"" while a survey by ORB for the Daily Telegraph had ""Remain"" at 53% and ""Leave"" at 46% once ""don't knows"" were stripped out. JPMorgan published a list last month of stocks with the highest sensitivity to the Brexit outcome, and that group has been trailing the market of late.The 22 stocks on the list, which encompasses companies from PPL Corp. (PPL) to Invesco (IVZ), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and PRA Health (PRAH) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.""U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions"" because they ""tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K."" Lakos-Bujas wrote. ""We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals.""Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. ""The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region,"" she wrote in a note to clients last week. ""It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure.""Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is ""poor,"" Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ford Motor (F), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, Barclays (BCS) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.

Overall S&P 500 earnings are still in a downtrend, but the pace of decline is less than feared.The market is rewarding stocks like Apple, which is trading above 100 for the first time since late April. But fund investors aren't exactly piling in. Technology ETFs saw net outflow of $617 million in July -- a month that saw real estate exchange traded funds rake in $1.2 billion in fresh money, according to State Street Global Advisors.For Dave Mazza, head of research at State Street's SPDR ETFs, that's a telling sign of investor sentiment.""In an environment where growth is scarce, I would expect to see ETF investors walk into an area that's offering growth, but we're not seeing it,"" Mazza said. This earnings season came on the heels of the Brexit vote and in the middle of presidential conventions that drove investors' attention away from company fundamentals and more toward ""bigger-picture items,"" he noted.And the broad macroeconomic outlook is awash in uncertainties.""Volatility is here to stay as investors fret over the extended age of the current bull market, a lack of earnings growth, China, Europe, and perhaps most importantly, the most divisive U.S. presidential election in recent memory,"" State Street's recent 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook noted. Against that backdrop, the firm has some advice for ETF investors:Smart beta strategies are low-cost and offer broad market exposure, while zeroing in on ""factors"" -- or stock characteristics -- that can give portfolios an extra boost over time, according to State Street.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Mix (QEMM) are ETFs that seek out promising factors for the current market scenario.SPHD looks for S&P 500 stocks showing low risk and high yield. It has jumped 20.4% year to date vs. a 7.1 gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a comparable ETF that gives you the broad U.S. market with no extra frills.Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global, says the industrial sector is -- against the odds -- leading Q2 earnings growth, with consumer discretionary. ""The aerospace and defense industry group dominates the upside surprises for industrials this quarter and even accounted for several guidance raises,"" Bell wrote on Wednesday. Boeing (BA) landed the biggest earnings beat in the group. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and L-3 Communications (LLL) have bumped up outlook.IBD'S TAKE: To find out which exchange traded funds investing in sectors and industry groups are the current stock market leaders, check out ETF Center.Aerospace is a pocket of strength within industrials, according to Bell. ""We expect that to continue as the remainder of 2016 plays out and believe any improvement, no matter how small, in the economic environment will be a tailwind for the group into the future."" Three ETFs target this niche, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Health care is another sector with stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings growth, making it worthy of a spot on ETF watch lists.Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors, whose popular tactical ETF-based strategy invests across nine sectors, is impressed with the latest earnings beats by chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Self told IBD he's ""going back in"" to technology with iShares North American Tech (IGM). Self also likes tech multinationals -- as well as gold miners -- as a weak dollar play.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) offers an efficient way to hold and trade the precious metal in a brokerage account.

989,L,"Universal Display (OLED), a provider of materials and technology for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and lighting, climbed to an all-time high on Monday, three days ahead of its second-quarter earnings report.Universal Display rose 4.2% to 73.82 on the stock market today. It notched a record high of 74.39 in intraday trading Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display is an IBD 50 stock with an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning that it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the last 12 months. Coherent has a 95 Composite Rating. To get a high-definition look at their ratings, check out IBD Stock Checkup.The Ewing, N.J.-based company is benefiting from smartphone makers shifting to OLED displays from LCD screens for their handsets. Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be using OLED displays in its iPhone 8, due out next year.Another company cashing in on the OLED trend is Coherent (COHR), which makes gear used to manufacture OLED displays. Its stock hit a record high on Monday as well.Coherent stock closed 1% higher to 107.10 on Monday. In intraday trading, it reached an all-time high of 107.72.  The stock is extended from a 98.59 buy point cleared last week as Coherent reported strong earnings on OLED gear demand.Coherent makes lasers and laser-based technology for scientific, commercial and industrial customers.Samsung is the top manufacturer of OLED displays today, but much of its capacity is taken by the company's own smartphone unit. Other display manufacturers are quickly ramping up their OLED display production.Last week, South Korea-based LG Display (LPL) announced plans to invest $1.75 billion to boost its OLED display production to meet the growing demand from mobile device makers. LG Display rose 0.1% to 13.98 on Monday.Universal Display is scheduled to report June-quarter results after the market close on Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Universal Display in Q2 to earn 50 cents a share, up 22% year over year, on sales of nearly $69 million, up 18%.RELATED:Fueled By iPhone 8, OLED Displays To Take Over SmartphonesOLED Display Technology Leader Makes 2nd Acquisition In Week

990,L,"Stocks saw robust gains fade somewhat heading into Monday's close. Breakouts remained on the thin side, and Walt Disney (DIS) was struggling to reclaim the critical 50-day moving average.Such action by Disney shares in the stock market today reflects the need for the stock to continue a strong rebound before a valid new buy point emerges. The stock, up 0.6% to 99.61, is also well below its 200-day moving average, currently near 103. Disney  did hit 100.96 in the morning.The Nasdaq composite led the upside among the major indexes, up 0.7%, after much-larger intraday gains. The last time the tech-centric gauge showed an advance of 1% or more was its 2% rally on May 24. The Dow Jones industrial average also advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lifted 0.6%. Volume was running much lighter than Friday's levels due to the quadruple witching session of expiring stock options, index options, index futures and stock futures on Friday.Small caps were outperforming, with the S&P SmallCap 600 jumping 1.2%. The Philly SOX index, a key gauge for semiconductor stocks, rose 1.15%.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) jumped 2.5% early Monday as big banks on both sides of the Atlantic rallied on hopes that Britons will vote to stay in the European Union in Thursday's Brexit vote. But JPMorgan rose just 0.2% shortly before the closing bell.Walt Disney shareholders are beaming in the wake of the outstanding box office results for its ""Finding Dory"" animated film, breaking the company's opening-weekend sales record for an animated film. Analysts are also generally upbeat about the newly opened Shanghai Disneyland Park, Disney's second such resort in the Middle Kingdom and first in mainland China.However, as reported frequently by IBD, Disney has been struggling to grow its cable franchise, as more TV watchers opt for streaming services.Disney is expected to increase fiscal-third-quarter profit in the April-June quarter by just 11% to $1.61 a share, which would match its dullest gain over the past 11 quarters. In the fiscal Q2 period of FY 2015 and the current fiscal year (ending in September), Disney's profit also grew just 11%. The company's 93 EPS Rating is the second-highest within the Media-Diversified industry group on IBD Stock Checkup, but the Composite Rating of 65 needs improvement.On Nov. 18, Disney broke out of a rather asymmetrical cup with handle at 117.68, but weekly volume shrank vs. the prior week. The stock rose only as far as 120.65, failing to hit new highs, and then tanked. It sliced through the 200-day line in huge volume on Dec. 18.Among IBD 50 names, CoreSite Realty (COR) and LGI Homes (LGIH) each advanced more than 1%. But the latter pulled sharply off its session high, and volume is running 77% above normal levels. Watch to see if LGI can close the session at above the 30 level, something it has not done since Dec. 4.As seen in Friday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook is at ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower, given the increased intensity of professional selling. The S&P 500 saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) recently rise back to 5, while the Nasdaq is currently tagged with four distribution days.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and Relative Price Strength?

991,L,"Bureaucracy: Businesses got a last-minute reprieve after a federal judge blocked a new feel-good overtime rule — one written by bureaucrats and set to go into effect on Dec. 1 — that would have raised labor costs significantly in the U.S. and killed thousands of jobs.Companies were girding for the massive new labor tax after the Labor Department decided that the threshold for overtime pay would be increased from the current $23,660 a year to $47,476 — meaning a huge hike in overtime costs for many businesses.A Congressional Budget Office study said that 3.9 million more workers would have been eligible for overtime. But the law's impact is perverse: For those earning close to the $47,476 overtime ceiling, many businesses would simply raise their pay above the threshold to avoid paying overtime. Good for them.But others who are not so well-paid would lose hours or perhaps even their jobs, priced out of the labor market by bureaucratic fiat. As many as 900,000 workers would have been affected, according to the CBO. Many would be young, unskilled and lacking education — the ones who can least afford to lose jobs or experience, in short. And, overall, CBO said, repealing the rule would actually boost real family incomes.Fortunately, a group of 21 states filed suit in September to stop the rule from being implemented. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 50 other business groups joined in with their own lawsuit.On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant issued an injunction against the rule, agreeing that the Labor Department had overstepped its regulatory authority in ordering the overtime raise for millions and charging that Labor exceeded ""its delegated authority and (ignored) Congress' intent."" And to make clear this was no mere procedural squabble, he called the Labor Department action ""unlawful.""Powerful words, especially from a judge who was put on the bench by President Obama.To his credit, Mazzant got the decision exactly right, and for the right reasons. It was indeed an overreach by the Labor Department, an unlawful extension of an agency's power over the economy. But such actions are increasingly common at a time when the Federal Register of regulations now nears 80,000 pages in length, and the total estimated cost of regulation exceeds $2 trillion.Not only did the judge get the law right, but now the economy has one fewer issue to deal with as a new president enters office. This sets a welcome precedent that President-elect Trump can build on in rolling back the ever-expanding regulatory state — which, increasingly, has become an unelected, unchecked shadow government that rules by decree and operates outside our system's ordinary checks and balances.And for the record, even if overturned on appeal, this is the kind of rule that Trump can himself overturn when he gets into office — and should. It's time to take back the power of those who would rule us without our consent.RELATED: The Myth Of Financial DeregulationTrump's Bold Action For A New BeginningSome Labor Regulations Trump Can Cut Right Away

992,L,"Housing starts dipped 0.3% in May to an annual rate of 1.164 million units, the Commerce Department said Friday. Wall Street had expected starts to come in at a 1.15 million annualized rate. Building permits, a gauge of future of construction activity, rose 0.7% to 1.138 million rate. Economists had expected 1.14 million.Single-family starts edged up 0.3% vs. April and 10.1% vs. a year earlier. But single-family permits dipped 2%, though are still up 4.8% year-over-year.Starts up 9.5% vs. a year earlier, but permits are down 10.1%.Homebuilders have been reluctant to step up construction, despite tight supply that it is pushing home prices. Land and labor costs, red tape, and a general reluctance to overextend themselves after the housing boom-bust have all contributed. With mortgage rates once again headed lower and millennials a huge pool of potential buyers, demand should remain strong.D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) stocks have been setting up in consolidations. D.R. Horton rose 0.6% in late morning trade on the stock market today, with Argus Research initiating the builder at a buy with a 39 price target. LGI Homes rose 2.25% to 29.60, clearing a 29.42 buy point from a somewhat-faulty base.

993,L,"Feverish chip-sector M&A spiked late Wednesday as ASML (ASML) announced its plan to acquire Taiwan's Hermes Microvision for $3.1 billion, and Cavium (CAVM) unveiled a $1.3 billion bid on networking firm QLogic (QLGC) -- upsetting investors on nearly all sides.Cavium stock toppled 17.5% to a 20-month low on the stock market today. ASML stock closed up 1.5%, and shares of ASML rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) -- which are struggling to complete their merger -- gained 0.3% and fell 0.2%, respectively.QLogic stock surged 9.3% on its acquisition, set to close in Q3.ASML's massive bid on Hermes Microvision is a technology play, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote Thursday in a research report. ASML is angling to combine process control with wafer processing steps at leading-edge process nodes, he says.Not long ago, KLA-Tencor dropped its EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) mask inspection program, which ASML needed to make its EUV tool viable, Robert Maire of Semiconductors Advisers wrote in a research note. Lam benefits from multi-patterning at EUV's expense, so ASML had no choice but to go on an M&A hunt.ASML could have outbid Lam for KLA, but instead it did ""the next best thing and bought the competitor that had beat KLA in the market,"" he wrote. Now, ASML is unlikely to work with Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA, and it will instead ""try to choke off"" competitive products from Applied Materials and KLA.Like the Lam-KLA merger, ASML's acquisition of Hermes Microvision could face U.S. Department of Justice antitrust concerns, Maire said. Mok, on the other hand, says ASML's bid could benefit Lam's deal.""It counters anti-competitive concerns as KLA's competitors come together,"" he wrote. ""Also, it highlights the increased need to combine process control with other types of equipment at the leading edge, supporting Lam's rationale in acquiring KLA.""The ASML deal could spark further consolidation in the chip-gear market, Mok said. He sees Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI) and Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) as potential takeover candidates.
"
994,L,"Dana Milbank and Ruth Marcus are both Yale-educated reporters-turned-columnists at The Washington Post. They view the world through the same lens. This sometimes means they can write pretty much the same column. It also means they both have a huge blind spot when it comes to sympathizing with Hillary Clinton.Last Sunday, both columnists wrote about the damaging report from the State Department's inspector general, which concluded that Clinton's act of putting her State Department e-mail on a private server was authorized by no one but the self-appointed queen herself. Even the network newscasts, so normally supportive of the presumptive Democratic nominee, subtly implied that Clinton's self-defenses had been exposed as lies. But these two columnists concluded she was only guilty of a self-inflicted wound on her campaign.Milbank's column was headlined ""Hunkered Hillary made things worse."" The pull quote from the Marcus column was, ""The greatest irony here may be that the Clintonian urge for privacy produces the opposite of what she needs.""Here's the blind spot: Both Milbank and Marcus think Clinton doesn't match Trump's nickname ""Crooked Hillary."" She's just too scared of the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" and overreaches. Her ""instinctive caution"" got the best of her.Marcus protests that this was just a dumb mistake, a ""massive failure of staff"" that no one talked Clinton out of a private server. Milbank's whole column can be boiled down to this rebuttal of Trump's nickname: ""This isn't quite true: Though investigations into her activities have occupied much of the past 25 years, her accusers, on Whitewater to Benghazi, never really get the goods.""These columnists speak negatively of Clinton's ""accusers"" -- the ones responsible for giving her ""scar tissue"" with their ""politically motivated attacks and endless investigations"" -- as Republican partisans. The silent omission in all of that is that neither of these journalists think it's the job of the media to investigate and ""get the goods,"" to make Clinton more transparent or accountable as a public servant.The media are only assigned to call Republicans to account.These journalists insist the Clintons should cooperate with investigators, but they refuse to admit that more often than not, the ""protective crouch"" works for them. Their relentless lying and hiding/destroying evidence seems damaging when it's fresh in the news for a few hours ... and then the media go back to papering it over.Take The Clinton Foundation. Imagine a Republican administration where a former president's wife became secretary of state, while he accepted huge donations to his foundation from foreign countries seeking preferential treatment in Washington, D.C. Would anyone ever think that would be permitted?But the liberal media just laid down on the job as the Clintons made a ""wink-wink"" arrangement with President Obama that The Clinton Foundation would stop taking new foreign donations ... except from countries that had previously donated to the foundation ... as long as donors didn't increase their contributions. And why not look the other way? The press has allowed the Obama administration to police itself since the start.Even now, after reporters exposed how The Clinton Foundation broke these rules — as if the Clintons would follow rules — the major networks offered just 27 minutes in all of 2015 to the massive conflicts of interest. This from the people who offered 88 minutes to Chris Christie's Bridgegate scandal in two days. And, in case you're wondering how many minutes the networks have spent this year on The Clinton Foundation: less than five minutes.So, why shouldn't the Clintons continue lying and hiding evidence? It's not like the media want to violate their precious ""urge for privacy."" After all, she's only running for president.

995,L,"Apple’s (APPL)  release of ‘revolutionary’ battery technology will drive an iPhone sales rebound in 2017, says a Morgan Stanley research report.“We believe Apple is working on revolutionary battery and charging technologies, which along with better displays, could drive the next upgrade cycle,” analyst Katy Huberty wrote in the report.While global smartphone sales remain tepid, Morgan Stanley says a rebound is in the cards. Besides Apple, it sees potential upside for Samsung, ARM Holdings (ARMH), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML (ASML),  Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).“Half of smartphone users point to battery life as the biggest source of dissatisfaction with their device, far greater than any other complaint,” Huberty wrote. “The combination of less power-hungry OLED screens, lower power consumption chips, and wireless charging technologies are likely to improve battery life significantly next year, driving upgrades much like larger screens did in 2015 for Apple and a couple years earlier for Android brands.”Morgan Stanley forecasts  smartphone unit growth of 6% in 2017 and 8% in 2018, compared with 3% both last year and in 2016.OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays offer richer colors, darker blacks and consume less power than LCD displays, says the investment bank. OLED displays -- expected to become a mainstream smartphone feature starting next year -- also are super thin and flexible, allowing for new device designs.“Improved battery life and flexible OLED displays should drive another supercycle next year, helping shrink time to replacement and accelerate growth for the major smartphone makers,” said Huberty. “The combination of OLED, less power-hungry chips, and wireless charging help drastically extend the time between charging.”Apple stock fell 1.5% to 97.34 in the stock market today.

1009,L,"Socialist media critics always insist that the commercial media cannot be trusted because they are funded by the likes of Kellogg's and Campbell's and McDonald's -- a capitalist advertising structure. Noncommercial media are inherently much more trustworthy. They are funded by liberal politicians, liberal foundations and interest groups.This bizarre stance came into stark relief on Friday when the Associated Press reported that the Ploughshares Fund, ""a group the White House recently identified as a key surrogate in selling the Iran nuclear deal,"" gave National Public Radio $100,000 last year to help it report ... on the deal.In his boasting profile in The New York Times Magazine, White House foreign-policy aide Ben Rhodes explained: ""We created an echo chamber. ... We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else.""The Ploughshares Fund's 2015 annual report explained that the grant to NPR supported ""national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of U.S. nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran's nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and U.S. policy toward nuclear security."" Ploughshares reports show at least $700,000 in funding over the last decade or so, and the AP also reported that ""all grant descriptions since 2010 specifically mention Iran.""This foundation is not neutral. Its president, Joe Cirincione, previously worked for the liberal Center for American Progress, where the board of directors includes George W. Bush-hating Valerie Plame -- who's no one's idea of a nonpartisan. The foundation boasted that its ""high-impact grantmaking"" created ""the conditions necessary for supporters of the Iran agreement to beat the political odds.""Ploughshares' money comes in part from other large left-wing funders of NPR. Ploughshares' 2015 annual report lists more than $100,000 in donations from George Soros' Open Society Policy Foundations, as well as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. NPR's underwriting announcements have proclaimed the foundation is ""committed to building a more just, verdant and peaceful world.""There is no transparency. Ploughshares representatives appeared twice on the NPR evening newscast ""All Things Considered"" over the last year and a half, and neither appearance came with a disclosure of the NPR grants. In 2012, NPR's ""Talk of the Nation,"" host Neal Conan did offer a disclosure: ""We begin with Joe Cirincione, now president of the Ploughshares Fund, an advocacy group that has underwritten NPR programs in the past."" As if the grants stopped?NPR interviewed pundits from other groups that received Ploughshares money (without disclosure). The 2015 annual report highlights ""selected radio interviews"" about the Iran nuclear deal, all of them on NPR: president of the National Iranian-American Council on ""The Diane Rehm Show,"" a research associate of MIT's Security Studies Program on ""Here and Now,"" and the vice president of government affairs of J Street on ""All Things Considered.""The most high-profile display of NPR's Iran deal support occurred in an August 2015 interview that NPR's ""Morning Edition"" anchor Steve Inskeep offered President Obama. It was more of a narration than an interview. ""The president says his critics are ignoring the idea that it's good to buy time,"" he robotically announced. ""It would be more honest, (Obama) contends, if his critics admitted they don't favor any diplomacy with Iran.""The only argument NPR can make about its ""independence"" from Ploughshares' win on the Iran deal -- with its ""high-impact grantmaking"" to supposedly objective media outlets -- is that its liberal tilt toward Iran was always guaranteed. Therefore, NPR's millions of left-wing foundation money are gifted from its natural allies, with no need for a special request for favoritism. It's already baked into the vegan cake.

1010,L,"War On Terror: America is in for a rough time in its War on Terror, based on what we've seen after the Orlando, Fla., terrorist attack that killed 49 people. How can you even hope to stop something like radical Islamic terrorism if you won't even call it by its right name?President Obama's response after the attacks was not only disappointing in its failure to recognize the ongoing threat from radical Islam, but likely endangered future American lives with its obtuseness. He couldn't even bring himself to use the most obvious words of all to describe what happened: ""Radical Islamic terrorism.""""I think we don't yet know the motivations"" of the murder, Obama said. Except, as Britain's Daily Mail points out, the terrorist ""pledged his loyalty to ISIS in a 911 call as he carried out the attack."" The loyalty wasn't one way: Islamic State radio called the terrorist, Omar Mateen, a ""soldier of the Caliphate.""Yet, our president, who is charged under the Constitution with protecting the nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic, seems to think that we're talking about a simple case of homophobia here. ""The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,"" Obama said.Relevant? Well yes, given that Shariah law punishes homosexuality with death. So Mateen, the ""soldier,"" killed 49 and injured 53 others merely to fulfill this mandate by his religion. Why couldn't Obama mention that? Is he so steeped in the twisted ideology of multiculturalism that he is unable to face reality? Even Hillary Clinton was moved to use the word ""radical Islam"" in response to this sick attack. Obama wouldn't.Unfortunately, this multi-culti sickness — a form of mass delusion on the left — extends well beyond the White House.The left went into a bizarre frenzy of blaming the horrible deaths of those murdered at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on anyone but Islamist terrorism. As our friends at the Media Research Center noted in a to-the-point headline: ""Anything But Islam: Media Attack Guns, Men, Christians, GOP Instead of Ideology in Terror Attack.""In case you're wondering, that was followed by seven printed pages of examples. So they weren't cherry-picking.Sadly, denial is everywhere in our society these days.Likely Republican nominee Donald Trump has called for a halt to immigration from Muslim lands, which has been falsely portrayed as ""racism.""He has made clear he would only keep a ban in effect until we find out just who we're letting into our country. Remember, by our government's own startling admission, we don't know if the recent refugee stream from North Africa and the Middle East contains dozens of Islamic State or al-Qaida operatives. So why wouldn't we halt the flow until we can better tell who's coming into our country?Aha, the left says, but Omar Mateen is a native-born American, born in New York. How do you keep him out? Well, you can't. But his father — an Afghani who has delivered pro-Taliban propaganda on U.S. cable television — clearly should never have been allowed in. Radical mosques that inculcate hate into young, impressionable minds should be investigated, at a minimum. Those that continue to abet terrorism overseas in the name of Islam should be closed.In April, an imam speaking at an Orlando mosque said that killing gays under Islamic law would be done ""out of compassion.""We should add that FBI Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper told ABC News that the FBI had twice looked into Mateen: In 2013, after he made what Hopper called ""inflammatory"" comments to co-workers, and again in 2014, after he was linked to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, another American who became a radicalized Muslim, who became a suicide bomber in Syria.Given that Mateen worked for G4S, a Department of Homeland Security contractor, shouldn't this have raised significant questions?One of Mateen's co-workers at G4S, Daniel Gilroy, told the Tampa Bay Times: “He talked about killing people all the time.”Yet, Mateen was interviewed by investigators three times in relation to those probes, but the FBI determined Mateen was no threat, Hopper said.Finally, on Monday, FBI Director James Comey said Mateen showed ""strong indications of radicalization"" and was likely inspired by foreign terrorist organizations.In short, he was a ""known wolf,"" not a ""lone wolf."" This is a disturbing pattern with terrorist mass murders, whether in Boston, San Bernardino or Ft. Hood, Texas. A pattern of behavior emerges, and is ignored. Ties to extremists are viewed as harmless. Then people are slaughtered.This problem will not go away. Indeed, the world has been repeatedly drenched with the blood of radical Islam's victims since 9/11 and before. As the observant Roger L. Simon noted, ""Total deadly terror attacks in the name of Allah since 9/11 stand at 28,576 with who-knows-how-many corpses.""But we're told over and over by far left that ""Islam means peace.""

1011,L,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 could see Synaptics (SYNA) bounced off the list of suppliers for the handset-- but it's unlikely, Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang said Wednesday.The iPhone maker has reportedly developed its own touch-chip for display screens, a role Synaptics had filled, but it will nonetheless still need Synaptics' OLED driver, Zhang said in a research note Wednesday.OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) allow for thinner and flexible smartphone and TV screens. It's widely expected that Apple will replace its LCD (light-crystal displays) iPhone screens for OLED displays with next year's iPhone update, expected to be called the iPhone 8. In September, Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone, the 7, which is expected to continue using LCD screens.Despite the Rosenblatt report, Synaptics stock fell 2.2% to 64.01 on the stock market today. Shares are down nearly 20% so far this year, while the U.S.-listed stock of rival LG Display (LPL) is up 3%.  (LPL Display fell 1.5% Wednesday). Synaptics' potential Apple loss is baked into its current stock price, Zhang says.He doubts Apple's touch-chip will be ready for OLEDs by next year. ""Therefore, we believe even Synaptics has the risk to lose Apple's panel driver (chip) business, but they still have a chance to remain as their OLED driver (chip) supplier,"" he wrote.Smartphone and TV panel prices zipped up in May and June, Zhang says. In the second half of May, 32-inch to 43-inch TV panel pricing was up $1, and an aggressive smartphone build ahead of the iPhone 7 launch tightened supply in June.The panel refresh should help AU Optronics (AUO), LG, Corning (GLW), Universal Display (OLED) and Synaptics, he said.  AU Optronics fell 0.35%, Corning 0.5%. Universal Display climbed 0.3%, setting another record close.And potential Synaptics suitors will take notice, Zhang said, reiterating his buy rating and 106 price target on Synaptics stock. On April 14, shares soared 7.3% on renewed reports that a Chinese investment group was looking to acquire the company for about $110 per share.Those talks petered out two weeks later, when Synaptics reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings per share ex items that missed by $50 million and 30 cents, respectively. Synaptics stock fell 5.6% in response.Rumored acquirers ""would prefer to monitor whether the business will recover or continue deteriorating in the second half (of 2016),"" Zhang wrote, though he said that Chinese investors remained interested.

1013,L,"Stocks traded lower in afternoon trading Friday as markets prepared to close out the week with losses.The Nasdaq fell 0.7%; the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4% in the stock market today, with Apple (AAPL) weighing on all three indexes.Volume was tracking high on both exchanges.Before the open, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned that the economy can't withstand more than one interest rate increase this year.Apple (AAPL) was down nearly 2% after reports that Chinese regulators said the iPhone maker has violated the patent of a domestic competitor with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S.However, the phones are still being sold in China, and Apple has several avenues of appeal.GrubHub (GRUB) delivered a near-4% gain on above-average volume, but might be finding resistance at the 30 level from which it fell Oct. 27 after a disappointing earnings report. The stock is well off its high and appears to be carving out a long, deep consolidation.Does GrubHub have the right stuff to be a stock market leader? Chew on the number at Stock Checkup.LGI Homes (LGIH) also rose more than 3% on above-average volume. It emerged from a flawed base with a 29.42 buy point.Among IBD 50 stocks, 37 were lower and 13 were higher. The best performer was computer-networking company Gigamon (GIMO), up more than 2% in above-average volume. The worst performer was clinical services provider  PRA Health (PRAH), which fell 3.4% and sliced through its 200-day moving average, although volume was light.

1014,L,"The major averages remained lower Friday afternoon, led by Apple (AAPL) and internet bellwethers Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB).The Nasdaq retreated 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were each down 0.5%. All three indexes were near session lows. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher than Thursday due to the expiration of options contracts.Alphabet, the parent of Google, sank 2.5% in heavy volume after analysts at Citigroup said that marketing spending on Google search appeared to be declining and that YouTube's growth might be slowing.Alphabet undercut the low of its flat base consolidation after undercutting its 50-day moving average on Thursday.How does Alphabet stack up against its peers in the internet content group?

1015,L,"Amazon.com fell nearly 2%, while Facebook lost 1%.Most IBD 50 stocks were lower, but LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 3.6% to 30, clearing a 29.42 buy point in heavy volume, as building stocks rose on a smaller-than-expected decline in housing starts. Building permits increased less than forecast, however.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which designs microprocessors and semiconductors for consumer-electronic devices, jumped 7% to a new high after Canaccord Genuity upgraded the stock to buy from hold.

1016,L,"The stock market added to gains late Monday morning ahead of comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. The building sector showed mixed action, with LGI Homes (LGIH) strong but Home Depot (HD) retreating. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and Broadcom (AVGO) held above buy points.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.6%, the S&P 500 0.5% and the Nasdaq 0.4%. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 0.7%. Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Friday.Comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen are in focus today. Yellen is scheduled speak at 12:30 p.m. ET to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia on economic outlook and monetary policy. Several Fed officials have already made comments Monday, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard saying that the odds of a June rate hike are much lower following Friday's surprisingly weak jobs report.Amazon.com was up a fraction near 729, still above a 722.55 buy point. Broadcom fell 0.4%, giving back just a tiny piece of Friday's breakout.LGI Homes gapped up and is currently more than 2% higher. The homebuilder's breakout on May 9 failed quickly, but shares are trying to climb back above the 29.87 buy point. Late Friday, LGI Homes reported a 69.4% surge in May home closings vs. the year-ago period. For the first five months of 2016, closings rose 35.5%.LGI's move adds to a rally in homebuilding stocks, most of which remain in deep price consolidations. But the gains among builders appear to be dovetailing with an advance in building products that started earlier.However, the nation's top two home improvement chains were down sharply. Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot slid more than 2%. Lowe's has held above its 77.73 buy point so far but Home Depot is now trading below its 50-day moving average.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) slid 5%, as the stock continues to suffer following a slowdown in gun-permit background checks. The stock sank to its long-term 200-day moving average, where it will now try to rebound. Group peer Sturm Ruger & Co. (RGR) also fell sharply after a new report showed slowing background checks in May.

1017,L,"Diversified ETFs paying robust dividends often provide a refuge to investors rocked by choppy markets. Some of the highest dividend payers, however, offer far less safety and require far more caution.Five nonleveraged ETFs with decent trading volume offer yields of 10% or more. These funds tap into high-dividend companies in the energy, mining and real estate sectors. That makes them sensitive to the outlook for commodities, interest rates and the economy itself.Still, these exchange traded funds can play a key portfolio role. Their dividend payouts offer attractive equity income to retirees and others. They also significantly shore up the funds' total returns.They're worth a look now by income investors, because some are showing signs of strength as they come off multiyear lows.Some of the yield is baked into MLPs' structure: They must pass at least 90% of their income to their investors.AMLP has an annual yield of 9.73%. Its distributions are paid out quarterly.MLPs also enhance portfolio diversification. They're loosely correlated to other income-oriented asset classes, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc.On the flip side, this ETF's unusual corporate structure has dented performance. AMLP has lagged its benchmark by roughly an average annual 3% since inception. Its top three holdings are Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP).As midstream businesses, MLPs are more insulated from crumbling commodity prices. They're not, however, entirely immune to a deep slump in the energy sector. AMLP is trading far below its all-time high of 19.35, set in August 2014.It has jumped 7.2% in 2016 after a sharp rally in the past three months vs. a 3.7% gain for the S&P 500.The ETF is trading above its 200-day moving average. Although that gauge of technical strength is in a long-standing downtrend, its rate of descent has slowed.  The shorter-term, 50-day moving average is climbing higher, a bullish technical sign.YMLP has a 25.44% yield, unmatched by any other nonleveraged exchange traded fund. It also has “a drastic small-cap tilt, with attendant risk,” according to ETF.com.Major risks to MLPs include rising interest rates. That could dent access to funds for a capital-intensive industry.YMLP has returned 5.3% year to date.Mortgage REITs offer some of the highest yields, generated by the spread between the short-term interest rate and income from mortgage-backed securities.REM yields 11.39%.""Even small short-term rate upticks can have an impact on mortgage REITs' profitability,"" writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. In such a case, their dividends could come under pressure.REM has jumped 9.9% year to date.Despite the growing likelihood of a rate hike in June or July, this ETF chugs on. It is now perched above both its 50- and 200-day lines.Two other ETFs fall in this group of double-digit yielders.PICK has vaulted 15.2% year to date, but has encountered resistance at the 11.42 price level. The ETF sits 39% below its June 2015 high.

1018,L,"President Obama's political appointees are not only celebrated by the media as the best and brightest America has to offer; they are promoted as being so bright that they are allowed to boast about how they masterfully manipulate the press, like sculpting a can of smelly, journalistic Play-Doh.The New York Times Magazine wrote a long profile of Obama's deputy national security advisor for strategic communications -- his foreign-policy communications whiz -- Ben Rhodes, lauded as ""the master shaper and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press.""Don't blame social media for the traditional media's adoration of Obama. ""Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once,"" wrote David Samuels for the Times. He and his fellow ventriloquists first enter briefing rooms to dazzle and deceive the dedicated journalists with certain beats.Then, there are the ""force multipliers,"" described as ""prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging.""In short, Rhodes declared, ""We created an echo chamber.""Rhodes exploited the fact that when newspapers close foreign bureaus to economize on staff, the gray beards disappear. Now, ""They call us (at the White House) to explain to them what's happening in Moscow and Cairo,"" Rhodes proclaimed. ""Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.""Exhibit A of the ""master shaper"" Rhodes bending the press to Obama's will was the Iran arms deal. The Times explained that Obama's team exploited the press by pretending the 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani and a ""moderate"" faction of the Iranian regime presented a brand-new opportunity to strike an Iran deal. But in reality, the Obama negotiators began talking to Iran in July of 2012, almost a year before the election. This false narrative entered the echo chamber. Polls showed that the American public didn't like the Iran deal, but the media just shouted over them with recycled Obama lingo about the ""historic"" and ""landmark"" agreement.Another example that wasn't mentioned by the Times is the death of four Americans at Benghazi. In 2012, Rhodes easily ventriloquized the media with the bizarre spin that the U.S. Consulate wasn't subjected to a terrorist attack, but that it suffered from a spontaneous protest over an internet video mocking the Prophet Muhammad. Even after Team Obama was forced to relent on this blatantly false talking point, the ventriloquist dummies wouldn't focus on how they had been used.Just last week, Fox News' chief Washington, D.C., correspondent James Rosen told host Bill O'Reilly that the State Department blatantly lied to him when he asked about the Iran deal negotiations timeline.""I can attest directly that the Obama administration, in the person of then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, of whom I am very fond, Bill, flat-out lied to me in February 2013,"" Rosen said. ""When I showed up in the briefing room at the State Department I asked, point-blank, 'Are there any direct talks going on between the U.S. and Iran of any kind?' and she said 'no,' at a point when those talks had been ongoing for eight months.""The next step naturally followed. The other networks all ignored the kerfuffle over the Rhodes boasts as some sort of inside-the-Beltway snoozefest. The last thing a supine media wants to report is just how supine it is, even when the accuser is the liberal ""master shaper and retailer"" of Obama's narratives.

1019,L,"Dutch-based ASML Holding (ASML) agreed late Wednesday to buy Taiwanese chip gear maker Hermes Microvision, capping a busy night for M&A activity.ASML is one of the leading makers of lithography machines used to etch patterns into silicon chips. Hermes makes pattern verification equipment. A bigger company also could help ASML reach better deals with major chipmakers such as Intel (INTC), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).""Our two companies have worked together for almost two years to see how we could best combine our capabilities, and found that we could significantly improve this constructive cooperation and better serve our customer by teaming up as one company,"" ASML CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement.Earlier, Cavium (CAVM) said it would buy QLogic (QLGC) for $1.3 billion. Cavium shares dived late and QLogic soared on the deal.Meanwhile,  Envision Health (EVHC) merger with Amsurg (AMSG).

1020,L,"Stocks erased deep early-morning losses, and the major indexes mixed to higher in late afternoon trading.Apple (AAPL) reversed off its lows to get back into the green. But the mega-cap name continues to lag its other big-cap tech peers, as its 50-day moving average acts as a damper.The Nasdaq composite, off as much as 1.1% in the early going, shaved its loss to 0.1% by 2:57 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 was up nearly 1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3%, boosted by gains in components Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT) and Verizon (VZ), each up 0.7% or more.Volume was up on both exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.Merck is up nearly 3%, and volume is racing nearly 200% above its usual levels. Its 50-day average volume is 8.1 million shares. The stock is showing healthy action lately as it's strung a small series of higher highs and higher lows since bottoming at 47.97 on Feb. 8. The pharmaceutical giant is now forming a large saucer with handle, yielding a 57.50 buy point. Note that the stock had trouble surpassing the 60 level numerous times in 2015.On Thursday, Merck announced positive results from a clinical trial showing that its new Keytruda medicine extends survival as a single therapy for lung cancer patients. Analysts on consensus see Q2 earnings rising 6% to 91 cents a share and up 4% to $3.72 for the full year.Merck has also rebounded nicely following declines to the 50-day moving average in both May and earlier this week. In contrast, fellow Dow 30 component Apple has been less robust, falling since a June 6 rally allowed the stock to briefly pierce its 50-day line before reversing.Institutional investors are clearly concerned about the tech titan's ability to protect and grow its monster-sized smartphone franchise. In the quarter ended in March, Apple actually reported a first-ever decline in iPhone unit sales, and revenue fell 13%, hurt in part by a strong dollar. However, Wall Street sees revenue falling the next two quarters by 15% and 9%, respectively.As IBD noted in a stock market update on Wednesday, the number of mutual fund holders in Apple have fallen mildly over the past four quarters. The same can be said about hedge funds, down from 174 funds owning a combined 117.7 million shares in Q2 2015 to 168 funds owning a total 58.7 million shares in Q1 of this year, according to data from William O'Neil + Co. In terms of total shares owned, that's a 50% plunge.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, LGI Homes (LGIH) has returned into the top 10 but is down 0.6% at 28.77. The Texas-based entry-level homebuilder is crafting the right side of a deep cup-style base. The stock is still 20% below a 36.07 peak. Its Composite Rating of 95 is tops within IBD's residential and commercial building industry group.As seen in the Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market’s current outlook was downgraded from “confirmed uptrend” to “uptrend under pressure.” This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower, given the increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to four.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

1021,L,"People generally don't like to admit when they're wrong. It's just part of the human condition. But refusing to admit your miscues in the stock market can be costly.The fact is, even the best traders make a lot of losing trades. But they know better than to argue with the market, and they keep their losses small. With a swing trading approach, this is even more critical because a large loss can wipe away the hard-fought gains of many trades.Smaller profit goals mean cutting losses even quicker. Rather than an 8% loss-cutting strategy, make a goal of losses averaging less than 2% to 3%. You can use a set percentage from your purchase price as your sell point, but an alternative is to use a natural support area identified on the chart.For example, an undercut of the low of a breakout day or reversal day suggests that the trade is in danger of failing. Maybe the stock needs to put in more time. But instead of waiting it out, just take the loss and move on to the next trade. Time is a big factor in swing trading.One of the pitfalls of taking losses quickly is that you will see a number of stocks shake you out and then go up without you. You may start doubting whether cutting losses quickly is a sound strategy. Just remember, the small losses are your insurance policy against a larger devastating loss.Even with small losses, a string of negative trades can take a big bite out of your portfolio. If you start seeing your batting average decline significantly, a likely culprit is a sideways market without a clear trend. Not much works in these markets. It's best to trade less often and with smaller positions until the market's condition improves.LGI Homes (LGIH) was put on the Swing Trader on April 22 as it broke out of a small consolidation (1). Volume was barely above average but was still at a 10-day high (2). The low of the breakout was set as the maximum loss for the trade. The trade started looking shaky the next day on a downside reversal. Then on the following day, the stock undercut the sell point intraday.Given the weakness, exiting the trade seemed to be the prudent action. It was moved to the past trades list at 28.02 for a 3% loss (3). That turned out to be 2 cents from the bottom that day. The stock steadily gained 3% from the sell level the rest of the day, ending up slightly above the entry price.However, in just over a week the stock was back below the sell point and then some. LGI Homes was potentially setting up again (4), but earnings were due, so it was left alone.Stubbornness could have led to an eventual decline of more than 17% (5) from the original entry over a month's period of time. Taking the loss quickly avoided a bigger loss and freed up the cash for other opportunities.Subscribers and trialists to Swing Trader can view the full details of this real-time trade, as well as the complete history of all trades, in the Past Trades section of Swing Trader.

1025,L,"Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) could be forced to trim competitive segments to push through the $10.6 billion merger that threatens to swallow rival Applied Materials (AMAT), Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire said Monday.And unlike Applied Materials' failed attempt to acquire Tokyo Electron, Lam only sees $250 million in initial savings and therefore has less wiggle room to negotiate potential antitrust remedies, Maire wrote in a research report.""Both Lam and KLA are already superbly run companies without a lot of cleaning up to be done,"" he wrote. ""This suggests that there is not a lot to be gained in efficiency by the combo as they are already quite profitable as separate entities.""The synergies, however, have likely prompted antitrust concerns. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request,"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA. Now, the duo could be forced to sign a ""plea bargain,"" Maire said.KLA products measure competitors' dep and etch tools, leading to a ""fox guarding the hen house"" paradigm where a Lam-owned subsidiary would be charged with rating rivals' tools. Under the DOJ consent decree, KLA could be forced to divest those businesses or license its technology.""The range (of potential remedies) is quite broad, from almost zero cost to deal-killing cost and everything in between,"" Maire said.Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron eventually called off their merger in the face of stringent regulatory concerns.After the DOJ rules, the Lam-KLA deal still faces potential fights from regulators in Japan, China, Korea and the Netherlands, where a number of rivals operate. And major chip manufacturers Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) also will likely have objections, Maire says.""We would imagine that they are concerned about their suppliers gaining too much leverage against them and holding too much consolidated power,"" he wrote. ""Both are probably happier with the status quo.""On the stock market today, Lam and KLA stocks each rose a fraction, trailing a 1% rise in Applied Materials stock. No. 1 chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) stock also rose a fraction Monday.

1026,L,"Politico Magazine published its third annual ""Media Issue,"" complete with polls of reporters who are perhaps the most resistant to being polled, fearing how they might reveal which viewpoint is ideologically dominant in the press.So, who will these reporters vote for in November? Reporters surveyed were very, very coy. Politico surveyed 82 members of the campaign press corps, and only 12 of them (less than 15%) admitted they would vote for Hillary Clinton. Sanders, Trump, Cruz and Kasich drew one reporter apiece. Most of them (48) checked the boxes ""don't plan to vote"" or ""don't know."" Color us skeptical. When asked if they were registered with a political party, 21% of the campaign reporters said Democrat, 22% said independent, 8% said Republican, and 49% said they are not registered.We should note this sample was not entirely composed of objective outlets, but included some conservative media (the National Review, the Daily Caller and the Washington Examiner) and some tilted hard to the left (the Huffington Post and Al Jazeera).A separate Politico survey of 72 members of the White House press corps gave the same results: Only 12 said they were voting for Clinton, three for Sanders, two for Cruz and one for Trump. Most (41) gave the chicken-out answers. When asked if they registered with a party, 27% answered Democrat, 13% independent and zero Republican ... zero. Sixty percent claimed ""not registered.""But the media's true tilt might be implied from the question, ""Knowing what you know now, who do think will be the next president?"" It wasn't close. Among campaign reporters, 86% said Clinton, and 10% said Trump. Among the White House reporters, 88% picked Clinton, and 11% picked Trump.The reporters who deny they tilt liberal or vote Democrat overwhelmingly believe the second President Clinton era is approaching. Despite Clinton lurching left to keep primary voters away from Sanders, journalists apparently see liberalism as wildly popular, despite the results of the last two midterm elections.What's funny is how reporters think Trump has the press eating out of his hand, and not Clinton. When asked if Trump ""successfully manipulates the media to his advantage,"" 94% of campaign reporters said ""yes,"" and just 6% disagreed. But when asked if Clinton ""successfully manipulates the media to her advantage,"" just 31% said ""yes,"" and 69% said ""no.""That wasn't the only hilarious polling answer. When campaign correspondents were asked which candidate has been treated the most kindly by the press, only 6% chose Clinton. Instead, it was split among Trump (34%), Sanders (21%), Marco Rubio (20%) and John Kasich (18%).When Politico asked it the other way -- which candidate has been treated the most harshly? -- 49% said Clinton. That's far ahead of Trump (15%), Sanders (9%), Rubio (8%), Cruz (7%), Jeb Bush (7%) and Ben Carson (3%).These answers suggest reporters aren't actually reading or viewing the actual press coverage. Which front-runner had the adoring press acolytes running joyously after her Scooby van in Ohio last year, cheering her burrito run to Chipotle (to be ""fun"" and ""new"")? And which one has been compared in the papers to Hitler and Pol Pot?Both Trump and Clinton have very high unfavorable ratings. His can be blamed in part on the national media. It's much tougher to prove that Clinton has had her character sullied, or her message mangled, by the very media that overwhelmingly think she is the next president.

1027,L,"Stout competition to take a chunk of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy business drove Applied Materials' (AMAT) Q2 display orders to grow nearly sixfold, and Applied Materials CFO Robert Halliday doesn't see that slowing this year.On a year-over-year basis, display orders soared a whopping 483% to $700 million, accounting for 20% of Applied Materials' record-busting $3.45 billion in Q2 orders. For the year, mobile will push more than 70% of those display orders, Halliday predicts.""The great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate,"" he said late Thursday on Applied Material's fiscal Q2 earnings conference call with analysts. ""It's not a one-quarter event, and we see the concentration in mobile.""In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Applied Materials stock rocketed more than 13%, near 22.50, touching a 14-month high. Chip-gear rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) stocks jumped 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. ASML (ASML), the No. 1 maker of chip manufacturing gear by market cap, was up 2%.Applied Materials' equipment enables chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Intel (INTC) to produce chips. Last year, Applied Materials unveiled two systems that enable high-volume production of OLED displays.OLEDs, organic light-emitting diodes, are used to create thin, flexible displays and lighting panels for TVs and mobile. Apple is reportedly switching to OLED iPhone displays and might have tapped Samsung to make them, according to AppleInsider.com.The OLED opportunity is huge, Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said on the call.""New display technology, such as OLED, are enabled by materials innovation,"" he said. ""This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied.""At least four investment banks boosted their price targets Friday on Applied Materials stock, with Needham and Credit Suisse analysts noting Applied Materials' huge opportunity in China, where the company has a 30-year-plus relationship.During Q2 ended May 1, Applied Materials reported $1.97 billion in silicon orders, up 15% year over year. Nand (flash memory) accounted for 49% of those orders, as companies like Micron (MU) and Intel ramp their 3D Nand technology.""The almost $1 billion in Nand bookings confirmed Applied Materials' strong positions around 3D Nand with multiple products,"" Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a research report, as he boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 26 from 22. Mok rates the stock a buy.Chinese orders hit $903 million, accounting for 26% of the total, as memory customers transition to solid-state drives (SSD) from hard-disk drives (HDD), Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad said Friday.Dickerson noted Thursday that the company has doubled its sales in China over the last two years. Chinese customers are talking about spending $20 billion to $30 billion over the next four to five years, Halliday added.Ahmad boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 25 from 23 and kept his outperform rating.

1034,L,"A sizable number of entrepreneurs who sell products and services to financial planners were practicing advisors before they decided to run their own outsourcing firm. Their business idea often originated from their experience providing advice to clients.Often, they see an opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace and help peers boost results or deliver better service. Or they may crave a new career challenge.""I was a financial advisor for 18 years before I left in 2002 to set up my business as an efficiency consultant,"" said David L. Lawrence, who runs Efficient Practice in San Diego, Calif. ""At the time, there wasn’t any company doing what I wanted to do.""From his experience as a training manager at IDS Financial Services -- now Ameriprise Financial -- Lawrence found that he enjoyed helping advisors succeed. He tried to convince his bosses to create a business unit to implement his training principles and let him run it, to no avail. Eventually, he followed his passion and launched his own consulting firm.Click Here For The Full Financial Advisors’ Guide: Outsourcing ReportShifting from advising to becoming a vendor poses risks, but the long-term benefits can prove enticing. Advisors who want to flex their entrepreneurial muscles can build substantial businesses. And because they know their customer -- other advisors -- so well, they can hit the ground running without conducting extensive market research.""Sometimes, I miss being a financial advisor,"" Lawrence admitted. ""But I see the impact we have on advisors in terms of increasing their profitability.""For some advisors, forces beyond their control can redirect their career path. They may derive great satisfaction from serving clients, only to find the status quo suddenly becomes untenable.For more than 20 years, Dave Moran contentedly worked as an advisor. He owned his own firm for a decade, until the economic downturn threw him off balance in 2009.""For years, I thought that everyone who failed in the business became a consultant,"" Moran said with a laugh. ""But when the recession hit, it kicked my butt, and I had to reinvent myself.""With a longtime interest in career development, Moran began asking other advisors how they found employees. He realized he could establish a niche by setting up a recruiting firm based on a fee-only model rather than charging advisors a percentage of a new hire’s salary.In 2011, he opened Experienced Advisors Recruiting in Knoxville, Tenn. He sought to differentiate himself with his business model.""I know how hard it is to plan for the cost of bringing in advisors,"" he said. ""So having a fixed recruiting cost is easier for boutique wealth management firms to plan. But it was an unproven concept so it was risky.""Explaining his business idea to about a dozen advisor friends, Moran asked if would be of value. Their positive input encouraged him. Many complained that most recruiters don’t know the business.""If you’re going to become a vendor, you have to be methodical in your approach,"" he said. ""Don’t just listen to your gut. Do your homework. And make sure you have cash in the bank, because the biggest challenge is the ignorance of the market: People don’t know you exist, and marketing is expensive.""In recent years, his business has expanded beyond its initial focus on recruiting financial planners. His firm currently helps advisors fill openings for office managers, support staff and other roles.During his years as an advisor, Moran grew accustomed to outsourcing various functions, such as portfolio management, marketing and customer relationship management software. He was comfortable paying for outside expertise that he lacked.""I had used these firms and it went well, so I understood how advisors find value when outsourcing,"" he said. Now he’s on the other side, looking to provide advisors with a cost-effective service.Experts say that when weighing whether to abandon your practice in favor of running an outsourcing business, think strategically in terms of attracting clients. Scour the marketplace to identify your potential competitors, and determine how you will stand out.""My best advice is get a mentor who can help you develop a unique differentiation message,"" said Efficient Practice's Lawrence. ""I didn’t have that kind of mentor. If I did, it would’ve gotten me up to speed much quicker.""

1035,L,"Back in the day, if you wanted to get long the S&P 500 you had to purchase 500 separate stocks… That’s too many positions for your average investor / trader to manage, a fact which in the early days kept all but the most sophisticated market participants from trading the S&P 500 directly. Then, in April of 1982 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began trading a new type of futures contract. These contracts were “cash settled” which represented a radical departure from the “physically settled” commodities that had preceded them. Cash settlement changed the game and opened the door to financial futures contracts: instead of having the shorts forced to deliver a commodity at expiration they could merely settle the cash value of the contracts instead.The end result of all this meant that instead of buying 500 individual stocks a trader could buy one contract which gave them nearly the same risk exposure as owning the basket of individual cash equities themselves which made up the S&P 500 index. It turned out to be a popular idea. Just about a year later, the options markets followed suit, creating S&P 500 options contracts. These were derivatives on a derivative, based on an index. The mental gymnastics required to intuitively grasp such concepts took years to percolate through financial markets, but it could be argued that this made the economy stronger in many ways as a result.Then came the era of financial engineering which gave rise to over the counter derivatives. These “swaps” began to trade hands in greater and greater volumes, allowing sophisticated investors (which in this context means rich, not necessarily smart) the opportunity to make leveraged investments on baskets of stocks with greater ease than ever before.This process helped create the fertile environment in which we now live. In this new financial order, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) allow investors a plethora of opportunities to trade products heretofore unavailable to them. Many of these ETF’s are built upon the financial innovations of the past. Examples include leveraged and inverse equity ETF’s as well as exchange provided contracts for speculating on volatility and other higher dimension markets.For traders looking to speculate on the rise or fall of the US stock market, the current state of financial innovation offers a dizzying array of alternatives to choose from for any given risk exposure. For example, if we wanted to get long, i.e. to profit from rising prices in the S&P 500 we could:No pun intended, but that’s a lot of options! Given the choices, how do we evaluate which position to take? To begin to answer a question like that, it helps to visualize a number of likely scenarios. This can help a trader identify which position offers the best balance between risk and reward subject to a trader’s own internal needs and wants.  For every trader, this scenario analysis begins with the humble 1-lot.Depending on the market, a “1-lot” can take on a number of meanings. In the US stock market, the term refers to 100 shares or a “round” lot. In the futures markets the term refers to 1 contract. In the world of vanilla options, 1 contract can take on meanings ranging from 1 contract to 100 shares to a yard of yen. Whatever your numeraire or denomination, every student of the market begins with a 1-lot.Let’s begin by defining some hypothetical prices to get started. It is important to remember that these prices are not real prices, but merely provide an example to serve as a starting point for your own analysis of the market. Additionally, since not all of the products mentioned are available for long-term positioning, we will assume for the purposes of this example that we are looking to profit from a short term move that will occur during an intraday time-frame. This way we can compare apples to apples instead of short term against long term positions.Thus, suppose that at 9:30am the S&P 500 index is trading at 2075.0 even. Furthermore, suppose for simplicity assume that the S&P 500 futures contract is trading at 2075.0 as well. Additionally the SPY ETF is trading at $207.50. Let’s assume we think the market is going to rise by the end of the day. How could we profit from such a belief?Let’s start by evaluating some of the possible positions we could take to “get long” the S&P 500 index. The first method is to simply buy 100 shares of the SPY ETF. In this case, the cost of this position would be $20,750.00 given the purchase price of $207.50. Likewise, the max risk of this position is also $20,750.00. It is important to note that each “point” in the SPY is worth $100 per one-lot. Because the SPY tracks the cash equities closely, it will exhibit a very high correlation with the underlying index (aka we could call it “Delta one”)The second method we could take is with futures – we could buy 1 E-mini S&P contract on the CME. Depending on the current mood of the exchange, the collateral we would have to post for this position is probably around $5,000. Unlike some of the other methods we will discuss, if the position moves against us by more than around 100 ticks we could experience what is known as a margin call, which is a situation in which we have to post more collateral than we initially allocated when we initiated the position. Each “point” in the E-mini is worth $50 per one-lot.  Much like the SPY, the price of the E-mini futures contract will have very high correlation with the underlying index.A third method comes from Vanilla Options. For example, we could buy 1 contract of some kind of vanilla call option on the S&P 500 index. This could be an in the money, at the money, or out of the money option based on trader’s degree of aggressiveness. Out of the money options are in general the most aggressive type of position: the underlying must by definition make a significant move in order for the option to become in the money.  Going long options has the benefit of a known, limited amount of collateral to initiate the position. However, due to their mathematical complexity long options will have a varying degree of correlation with the underlying index (and thus subject to “dynamic hedging”)Another path we could take is with products called binary options. These are similar to long vanilla options but have a binary payout instead. In other words, if the strike of a binary option is 2100, the option will payout $100 if the underlying is above 2100 at expiration and zero otherwise. These options share many of the same traits as vanilla options, such as limited collateral and varying degree of correlation with the underlying. However there is one important difference: because binaries represent yes/no outcomes, the current price of a binary option is a proxy for the market’s expected probability of the underlying closing above a given strike at expiration. This could be more intuitive for some traders to understand compared to the premium of a vanilla option.The final option combines aspects of options and futures together into one product. Double barrier spread contracts, technically swaps in the United States, are in many ways like a future but act like options due to their barriers. In general, a spread contract has an upper and a lower strike. The upper strike puts a cap on the maximum value of the position (max value is upper strike minus lower strike). The lower strike puts a floor on how much money you can lose going long the position.For example, suppose again that the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is trading at around 2075.0. In particular, let’s take a look at the Nadex US 500 Spread with an upper strike of 2085 and a lower strike of 2065 which is based on the E-mini S&P futures. In this scenario, it is quite likely that the spread is trading at right around 2075.0, the middle of the range. In this scenario the spread will likely act a lot like a futures contract, rising and falling tick for tick. Here the funding required is much less where each “point” in the Nadex spread is only worth $10 per one-lot or $1 per tick.As the underlying approaches a barrier, however, optionality will creep into the price of the spread. For example, in the scenario above there could be another option with an upper barrier of 2095 and a lower strike of 2075. In this case, the price of the spread is likely to be above 2075. How much “premium” the price will include depends on the market’s expectation of future volatility. In general, the higher the expected future volatility the greater the spread price will diverge from the underlying when near a barrier.Now let’s examine what happens to each position under a rally in the stock market. In the first scenario, let’s assume that the S&P 500 experiences a decent rally towards the end of the day and is trading around 2095 by 4:15pm eastern time.In this scenario the SPY ETF is going to make money as the underlying index rises in value. After subtracting the costs of the fund the SPY is going to rise by a similar percentage to that experienced by the underlying index itself (e.g. [2095 – 2075] / 2075 = approximately 1%) . Your maximum risk, although it is unlikely to be encountered in a given day, is the full value of the position.The second method is via E-mini futures. In this case the dollar profit is relatively easy to calculate, simply take the number of points profit (20) and multiply it by the value of a point ($50) which means the e-mini one-lot will make $1000 in this scenario using initial collateral of around $5000. This is a return of around 20% on the collateral. Remember, however, that our maximum risk in this position could actually be greater than the initially collateral we posted.To calculate how much money we made from buying a vanilla option, we need to know how much premium we paid for the option and what the strike was. If the premium we initially paid was too high or the strike too far out of the money, we could still lose money even though the market rallied as we expected. If we paid a cheap enough price for the premium, however, we could make a decent percentage return on our investment.To calculate how much money we made from buying a binary option, we simply need to know the initial price we paid for the option (cost) and the final closing price of the underlying. If the underlying closes above our options strike, then we make $100 minus this initial cost, otherwise we lose the initial premium. This provides us a wide range of risk/reward opportunities. For example, we could simply buy a binary with a strike below the current price of the S&P 500, for example say 2070. If we paid $70 for this option it would expire at $100 even if the market moved sideways, no need for a rally. However we risk losing the full $70 if the market drops below 2070. Alternatively we could also take an aggressive stance, paying $20 at 9:30am for the 2090 strike. When the market rallies to 2095 this binary will make $80 profit on a $20 investment.Finally this brings us to the double barrier spread contracts. If we select a spread which is trading in the middle of the upper and lower strikes then the position's P&L will behave like a futures contract until it approaches one of the barriers. If we select a spread with a lower barrier near the current level of the market, its price will be determined by the market's current expectation of future volatility. This creates the potential for option like ROI if you're correct and the market rallies, as in this case the spread acts more like an out of the money call option.There are a wide range of methods available to modern traders to get long a stock index like the S&P 500. Which one is right for you depends on your preferences for blending risk and reward? The good news is that you can structure the trade in different ways depending on your current risk stance and outlook on the market whether you want to trade aggressively, or conservatively.Futures, options and swaps trading involve risk and may not be appropriate for all investors. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

1037,L,"Contrary to his “all of the above” energy strategy announced several years ago, President Barack Obama has now jumped on the “keep it in the ground” bandwagon that is currently being voiced by most of his environmental constituency. In recent months he has vetoed the Keystone Pipeline, put limits on coal development on federally-owned land and yanked the Atlantic offshore leasing program -- all in the name of combating climate change.Then several weeks ago, the administration declared it would soon push regulations to control methane emissions from the oil and gas industry for the first time.  As a follow-up, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has initiated a formal process requiring energy companies to provide information on methane releases from oil and gas drilling, transmission, processing and storage. These new regulations are on top of a recent EPA rule that requires producers to upgrade equipment and reduce methane leaks on new and modified wells.Even though methane accounts for less than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the U.S., the White House justifies its new regulations by arguing that methane traps 50 to 75 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over a 20-year period, thereby contributing significantly to human-induced global warming. This may be the case. But “declaring war” on energy-related methane releases will do little or nothing to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions.In the first place, methane releases from the oil and gas industry represent only about 3.4% of all U.S.-emitted greenhouse gases, which in total are lower today than they were 20 years ago. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry and the states have already taken steps to significantly reduce releases at well sites, as evidenced by the fact that total U.S. methane emissions have dropped 15% since 1990, even as natural gas production, of which methane is the principal component, has nearly doubled.Globally, methane emissions are increasing. But a just-released study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) finds that “the U.S. energy industry contributes little to the overall burden of global fossil fuel emissions.” Rather, according to NOAA, wetlands and agriculture are the culprits.Studies by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) and other energy researchers are challenging assertions by the EPA that reducing methane leaks 45% by 2025, which is the current proposal, will benefit the climate to the same degree as shuttering one-third of the world’s coal-fired power plants. NERA concludes that the alleged benefits of its methane rules are “highly uncertain and very likely overstated,” while an analysis by Energy in Depth finds that the rule would reduce global warming by a mere 0.004 degrees Celsius. Put differently, we could shut-in all American oil and gas production, and the impact on climate change would be virtually zero.Regulation is never cost-free, and the new methane rules are no exception. With oil and gas prices at 10-year lows, producers and service companies laying off tens of thousands of workers, and bankruptcies rising, does it make sense to increase the cost of staying in business?What’s more, the huge increase in America’s natural gas production over the past decade has actually been a net-plus for the environment. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently observed that an “increased and diversified gas supply is an important reason for a reduction of GHG emissions in the United States,” while the International Energy Agency (IEA) has observed that natural gas is a “valuable component of a gradually decarbonizing electricity and energy system.”If its goal is to fight global warming, the administration is beating the wrong horse with its new methane reduction rules. More importantly, energy policies and regulations should not be driven by environmental alarmists, which is clearly the case today, but rather by sound science and careful cost-benefit assessments.

1038,L,"In January 2005, Larry Summers made a comment about women during a speech that was a gross generalization. It was also grossly erroneous.Now, we are talking about a highly accomplished individual. Summers served as U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Bill Clinton presidential years. He became an economics professor at age 28 and has written 150 scholarly papers. He advised President Obama on what to do about the biggest banks and the auto industry during the Wall Street subprime debt meltdown of 2008.However, Summers' comment at a National Bureau of Economic Research luncheon -- that innate differences between men and women may explain the relatively low number of women scholars in the physical sciences -- raised a lot of hoopla in academic circles and at Harvard University, where at the time Summers was serving as president. The Harvard Crimson reported that MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins ""felt physically ill"" after hearing Summers' remarks.Some believe the controversy ultimately cost Summers his job.What does this anecdote have to do with the art and science of stock investing?If you want to be a great stock picker and an equally great stock seller, then it matters practically zilch whether you are a man or woman. The market is blind to your sex.What factors matter far more?

Being male or female does not give you an advantage or disadvantage in any of these factors.Such a statement may seem a minority view.Go on your computer, iPad or smartphone and type in, ""Are women investors better than men?"" Google will list a stream of stories that argue such a case. In December last year, AARP's website began one article in this way: ""Overall, women are better investors than men.""The reason? The writer cited research from professors at the University of California-Berkeley who concluded, after a study of stock trading patterns between the sexes, that men trade 45% more than women. The scholars argued that since frequent trading eats away at returns, women thus performed a full percentage point better than men.Excuse me?When it comes to mastering IBD's CAN SLIM investment system, frequent buys and sells are a part of the process. No one will perfectly pick the next Home Depot (HD) (up 1,835% from its Oct. 20, 1981, breakout to a peak in September 1983), Wal-Mart (WMT) (giant market winner from the late 1970s to 1990s), L Brands (LB) (formerly The Limited, one of the biggest stock market winners in the women's apparel industry), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Qualcomm (QCOM) or Apple (AAPL) in every single trade.In a field of 10,000 stocks trading each day, the mathematical odds are simply too low.Good trading is certainly an act of research and preparation before you buy any security. But the search for great stocks also carries a big element of trial and error.Speaking of errors, do you think the founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, William O'Neil, ever made bum stock trades? Of course. Not every stock O'Neil touched turned into gold. But O'Neil's greatness in the stock market came not only in the ability to find and clarify the elements of great stocks at the start of their huge price runs (what CAN SLIM is all about). As associates who have worked closely with O'Neil will tell you, he also succeeded by quickly recognizing his errors of market judgment and keeping losses in many stocks very small.Over the years, women have made strides in the field of equity research and portfolio management. You can read about their adventures on Wall Street via books such as ""Tiger Woman on Wall Street"" by Junheng Li. Meredith Whitney became famous for making a bearish call on Citigroup (C) in late 2007, saying the big bank will be forced to suspend its dividend (she was right). Whitney later left Oppenheimer as a research analyst and started a hedge fund. But in 2015, she was forced to close Kenbelle Capital LP due to poor results and an exit by its largest investor, according to a June 11, 2015, Wall Street Journal article.To be fair, innumerable men have had far more spectacular failures as fund managers. John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management, which included two Nobel Prize winners, blew up big time in the fall of 1998. The point: Being a woman doesn't provide you immunity from a stock market that is going the opposite direction of what you think or feel. Everyone must respect the market.""I will never give myself the luxury of thinking: I've made it,"" Zaha Hadid, the designer of the aquatics center at the 2012 London Olympics and other grand projects who died in March in Miami, once said. Although the star Iraqi-American architect wasn't likely talking about stock investing, such an attitude is valuable in the market.The stock market doesn't know who you are. It cannot know whether you're male or female. Nor will it ever care.

1039,L,"Stocks dipped at Thursday's open, swayed by disappointing economic data and a pack of strong, earnings-fueled stock moves.The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.4% each.Earnings news lifted Wal-Mart (WMT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) ahead of the open. Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) fell hard after its Q1 report. L Brands (LB), parent of the Victoria's Secret chain, tumbled 6% after an analyst downgrade.The stock market today was opening on the fence, with the S&P 500 only narrowly above its Dec. 31 close -- and even a mild slip will put it back in negative territory for the year. The Nasdaq is down more than 5% year to date and has pitched camp below its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 is struggling to hold its 50-day but remains well above its 200-day line, and the Nasdaq flashed some minor positive signals during Wednesday's action.Weekly jobless claims data fell sharply, but not as much as expected. The Labor Department reported claims of 278,000 in the week ended May 14 — down 16,000 claims. Consensus forecasts called for a decrease to 275,000 new claims. The four-week moving average rose to 275,750, a third straight increase.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey for May showed a minus 1.8 reading, essentially unchanged and sticking to negative territory now for eight of the past nine months. Economists' consensus had projected a rise to 3.The Conference Board releases its April leading economic indicators numbers at 10 a.m. ET.Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to speak at 9:15 a.m. ET, while William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, is on deck for a 10:30 a.m. ET speech. Fed comments, including April meeting minutes released Wednesday, have put a June rate hike firmly on the table.Crude oil pulled back sharply -- West Texas Intermediate dropped 2%, leaving it just above $47 a barrel and up a bit more than 2% for the week. Gold also dropped almost 2%, to below $1,255 an ounce. The dollar rose vs. the euro but was down against the yen. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 1.87%.Wal-Mart soared nearly 8% out of the open after reporting a strong first-quarter sales and earnings beat. Its shares ended Wednesday down 3% for the week so far, marking a second straight weekly decline that sent the stock below its 200-day moving average in heavy trade, interrupting a six-month advance.Cisco Systems climbed more than 5% after reporting late Wednesday, with its fiscal Q3 earnings narrowly beating and revenue declining less than consensus expectations. Management lifted its Q4 EPS guidance to just above consensus views. Cisco shares ended Wednesday fighting to hold support at their 200-day moving average, and in a 15-month consolidation.Auto parts retail stocks came under sharp pressure after two key earnings reports. Advance Auto dropped 5% after its first-quarter earnings stopped a dime short of projections, and revenue fell 1.9% -- worse than the consensus target. Management projected a same-store-sales decline of 3% to 5% for the year, and announced Chief Financial Officer Mike Norona would retire as soon as a replacement is found. The stock had declined for four straight weeks after meeting resistance at its 10-week moving average.Monro Muffler (MNRO) shed 13% after its fiscal Q4 results backfired, with earnings growth stopping slightly below view, and revenue printing well short of analyst expectations. The company also issued Q1 sales and EPS guidance that trailed the consensus targets.Peers also caught some of the premarket downdraft, sending AutoZone (AZO) lower by about 2% and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) off 1%.Overseas markets traded flat to lower. Benchmark indexes across Asia ended Thursday's session narrowly mixed. Markets in Europe were under some pressure near midday, led by London's FTSE 100 which traded 1% lower.

1040,L,"Chinese, Japanese and South Korean regulators could gum up Lam Research's (LRCX) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by following in the footsteps of the U.S. Department of Justice, which is asking for more information on the proposed merger, an analyst said Monday.Late Friday, the companies said the DOJ had sent a ""second request,"" digging deeper into Lam Research's $10.6 billion plan to acquire KLA-Tencor. Only 2%-4% of merger proposals get a second request, Semiconductor Advisors president Robert Maire says. Of those, he says about a third go through as planned but the other two-thirds either get challenged by the DOJ or get a consent decree, which is approval with conditions.In the Lam-KLA deal, the likely concerns revolve around antitrust. Together, the companies would be close to matching the market cap of Applied Materials (AMAT), which is No. 2 among makers of chip manufacturing equipment, behind ASML (ASML).Also, together they could pressure etch pricing for major players like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the latter an Apple (AAPL) supplier. Tokyo Electron and Hitachi (HTHIY), which compete against Lam in etch, might oppose having KLA continuing to inspect their tools and processes.""While not good news, a second request is certainly not a death sentence for the merger, but at the very least (it) means more time and money and scrutiny to get approval,"" Maire wrote in a research note. The 30-day clock for DOJ approval has now been reset.In midday trading on the stock market today, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor stocks were down nearly 2% and 1.4%, respectively, both near three-month lows. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Equipment industry group was down a small fraction midday Monday.Maire says the DOJ could ""ask for the kitchen sink of information.""""The (second request) is not just a simple test of overlapping product lines,"" he wrote. ""It looks at things like market concentration and anti-competitive issues. (Lam-KLA) would certainly have a large concentration of the overall market.""The chip industry is most concerned about KLA's standing as an ""impartial arbiter"" of others' tools, he says.""Will Lam dep and etch tools get an unfair advantage? An early look at results? A more complete look?"" Maire asked. ""(It's) kind of a lot like insider trading.""Lam and KLA already have the go-ahead from Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan, but they still needs a slew of other foreign approvals. This DOJ action can ""snowball into a problem"" if it becomes too costly, Maire says. Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron called off their merger in the face of strong regulator scrutiny.The request further delays the merger's close, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok noted in a research report, saying he expects the deal to close in Q4, as opposed to the companies' target for Q3. Western Digital (WDC) closed its $19 billion SanDisk acquisition last week, a merger that was announced within hours of the Lam-KLA match-up.Neither Mok nor Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri worry about the Lam-KLA deal getting approval, however. In his report, Arcuri called the second request ""more procedural in nature.""""There is no overlap here, and certain big customers have been pushing these companies together for several years, especially around the issue of yield ramp in 3D,"" he wrote. ""We continue to see the deal closing in (the) August time frame.""Arcuri cut his price target on Lam stock to 85 from 93. Lam and rival ASML recently indicated minor timing delays for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory)-related shipments, he wrote. Lam has guided shipments up for the second half of the year, but Arcuri isn't that confident.""Weakness for Lam seems focused on the memory side, with some signs of a less aggressive 3D Nand (flash) shipment cadence to Toshiba, seemingly due more to capital constraints at this customer rather than any fundamental change in the 3D Nand ramp itself,"" he wrote.But Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron (MU) and Intel Dalian haven't experienced any mirrored slowdown, he wrote.

1041,L,"The stock market's rally heated up with an hour to go in Monday's session, the first trading day in May. Volume was running at a slower pace vs. Friday's intense pace.Both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 gained 0.7% to 0.8%, holding near the highs of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average trailed only slightly, up 0.6%. Yield plays outperformed, with the Dow Jones utility average at one point up more than 1.1%.Equally as important, the Nasdaq is finding support at the 50-day moving average, which has been rising for the past six weeks. In strong market uptrends, the major indexes tend to trade north of the 50- and 200-day moving averages, not south.In the stock market today, aerospace firms showed some muscle. L-3 Communications (LLL) gapped up on Monday and rose 1.4% to 133.42, just above a 131.46 buy point within a six-month, saucerlike base pattern. More aggressive traders could have entered the stock when it broke through upside resistance near 121 on April 18. At that time, the stock cleared a trend line that can be drawn from the price high on the left side of the saucer at 131.36.The buy zone runs up to 138.03, 5% above the proper 133.42 entry. Leading stocks should not be chased far beyond the proper buy zone, as temporary pullbacks could shake you out of the stock. Read more about how to buy correctly here and at Investor's Corner.Last week, the supplier of a myriad of electronic systems, subsystems and components for the military and civilian aerospace industries posted a dramatic 51% jump in first-quarter profit to $2.08 a share, blasting Wall Street's estimate by more than 32%. It marked the strongest quarter of EPS growth in at least five years. Revenue shrank for the 11th straight quarter, down 5% vs. a year ago to $2.35 billion.L-3 noted in a news release that all of its businesses contributed to higher operating profit margins. The company also sold its ""National Security Solutions"" business as part of a re-focus on ""higher margin, high-returning businesses,"" CEO Michael Strianese said.L-3 gets a 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, which is respectable in light of the company's attempts to turn around its earnings picture. Earnings fell 4% to $6.91 a share in 2015, but Wall Street sees a 12% pickup for full-year 2016 to $7.71 and an 11% rise in 2017 to $8.54.IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry subgroup, made up of 51 firms, ranks 88th among 197 groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance and is barely positive for the year.Heico (HEI), featured last week in IBD's New America column, has also formed a long saucer base with a fresh handle, offering a new 62.79 entry. The stock rose 1.5% to  62.23.Did you know that Heico leads F-35 fighter jet maker Lockheed Martin (LMT) in terms of overall stock strength as seen in IBD's Composite Rating. Compare them at IBD Stock Checkup.On the downside, Chinese search engine Baidu (BIDU) sold off hard, falling nearly 8% to 179.26 in huge volume on news that the Chinese government will investigate the Beijing-based firm over the apparent death of a young man who sought to find information at Baidu's flagship site to look for potential treatments for his rare cancer.The stock gave back all of Friday's gains and more following Q1 results, which showed a 16% drop in Q1 profit despite a 19% revenue increase. It marked Baidu's second year-over-year EPS decline in three quarters, while revenue growth slowed for a third quarter in a row. Revenue climbed 38%, 31% and 27% in the prior three periods.

A government official in China said that the nation was headed toward an ""L-shaped recovery.""The Nasdaq shrugged off the overnight weakness in the Chinese markets, rising 0.5% in early action. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 loped 0.6% higher but then retreated to 0.2%. Volume was running roughly even vs. Friday's pace.Entry-level homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) hammered 3.5% higher, even though the home construction group wasn't doing a whole lot. However, there was one other homebuilder nailing down a big gain: William Lyon Homes (WLH) jumped more than 15% after reporting first-quarter results. Small-cap Lyons beat Wall Street's numbers on earnings and revenue.LGI Homes has fashioned a cup-with-handle pattern but is 19% off its high. The Texas-based construction firm reports quarterly results Tuesday before the open; Wall Street sees Q1 profit up 58% to 52 cents a share. William Lyon Homes is still more than 40% off its high.On the downside, ad technology provider Criteo (CRTO), which joined the IBD Sector Leaders list recently, sank 2%.

1047,L,"L Brands (LB) said Thursday it is restructuring its Victoria's Secret business in a bid to streamline the lingerie retailer's operations and strengthen core categories.Victoria's Secret will now be divided into three segments -- Victoria's Secret Lingerie, the millennial-focused Pink and Victoria's Secret Beauty -- with the a greater focus on core merchandise and the elimination of certain categories. About 200 positions will be cut at the company's headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, and its offices in New York.L Brands shares closed down 2.3% on the stock market today.About two years ago, Victoria's Secret exited most of its clothing business and stopped selling outerwear and jeans, among other items, though it still sells swimwear, workout gear and loungewear. L Brands did not specify which categories would get the cut this time around.The company also said it will integrate the direct business as a ""primarily digital channel within the Victoria’s Secret and Pink businesses to align with how customers engage with the brands,"" and will focus more on loyalty programs vs. coupons and catalogs.""We are making these changes to accelerate our growth and to strengthen the business for the long term by narrowing our focus and simplifying our operating model,"" said Chief Executive Les Wexner in prepared remarks, adding that the changes are ""necessary for our industry-leading brands to reach their significant potential.""In March, Victoria's Secret total comps including direct sales grew 2%, a deceleration from March 2015's 6% comp growth. Store-only comps were flat vs. 9% in the prior year. Including standalone Pink locations, there are 1,164 company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in the U.S. and Canada.""Going forward, we like Victoria's Secret's fresh spring color palettes and use of textures/patterns,"" said Cowen's Oliver Chen in his Thursday note. ""We believe newness and emotional/differentiated product offerings and exceptional operations from an inventory and business management point of view could continue to deliver upside to comps.""L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, said reported net sales for March rose 5% to $1.027 billion.

1048,L,"Short-selling -- the practice of betting that a stock will fall -- can be risky. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, you can control risk smartly by following a set of smart trading rules.What could happen if you don't follow good rules? Disaster could happen. Just ask Joe Campbell.According to various media outlets, Campbell said last November that he borrowed and then sold more than $30,000 worth of stock in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals. He had hoped to buy the shares back later at a lower price and pocket the difference. But the stock rocketed the next day on news that a group of investors took a majority stake in the company.As a result, Campbell was forced to buy back the shares from his broker, ETrade, at a much higher price. That wiped out the $37,000 in his trading account and then some. In all, Campbell reportedly lost more than $140,000.Not many short sales go as horribly awry as Campbell's. But the practice is risky, since losses can theoretically be infinite.Those who wish to learn to recognize the classic signs of a stock on the verge of breaking down and to follow sound rules can rack up big profits on the short side. To learn IBD's technique, read the monthly Short Side column, which now runs on the last Monday of each month. You can search the archives at Investors.com (hover over the ""Research"" tab on the home page, then click on ""Short Selling"") to know how to select a good short sale candidate, when to sell, and when to cover the position to nail down a gain or to cut your loss.For starters, never short a thinly traded micro-cap like KaloBios, since even relatively small trades can spark dramatic movements in price. Also, keep your losses small. A key IBD rule says to cover when a stock rises 7%-8% above the point at which you shorted the stock.Beyond that, there are telltale signs in a stock's chart that signal that it's on the verge of breaking down after a long advance. These include classic topping patterns such as the head-and-shoulders pattern, which looks like the outline of a head and shoulders, with the right shoulder typically just below the left.Other topping patterns include torpedo sell-offs, breakdowns from late-stage bases and L-shape patterns. It's important to note that these patterns are valid only for highly liquid stocks that have made huge advances of 300% to 400% or more in price. IBD offers a home-study program that discusses each short-sale scenario in detail.Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) started breaking down from a head-and-shoulders pattern in late 2014 after a huge advance from 17 in July 2012 to nearly 159 in November 2014. The run-up was fueled by strong sales of Keurig's single-cup coffee brewers and coffee cartridges, known as K-cups.The stock plummeted after profit growth slowed sharply, piercing its 10-week moving average in the week ended Nov. 21, 2014. Several rallies back up to the 10-week line helped form the right shoulder. The time to short comes when a stock tries -- and fails -- in its third attempt to retake the 10-week line. For Keurig, resistance at the 10-week line near 119 a share in early May 2015 created an ideal short-sale entry. Volume on the downside was heavy, a sign that institutional investors were bailing out.By May 7, the short sellers had achieved a 20% gain, the right time to take profits, as growth stocks can rebound quickly. Those who held on longer and had strong conviction were rewarded further as the stock failed several more times to overtake resistance at the 10-week line. Investors were worried about the company's slowing sales growth and uncertainty of success in new product launches.By late November, the stock hit a low of 38.90, good for a gain of more than 200%. On Dec. 7, 2015, Keurig rocketed 72% to 88.89 on news that a German private equity firm agreed to acquire the company.

1049,L,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett will give his insight into the company and markets at Saturday's eagerly awaited annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb.Buffett made Berkshire Hathaway's largest-ever purchase in January and reshuffled the company's portfolio.On Jan. 29, Berkshire announced it had completed the $37.2 billion (including debt) purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest buyout ever.Berkshire's net worth rose by $15.4 billion in 2015 as the company bought more shares of favorites IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire expects about 40,000 shareholders from around the world to attend the event. But you don't have to visit Omaha in person: For the first time ever, the so-called ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" will be streamed live, on Yahoo Finance. Buffett will offer his comments in what a press statement described as a ""no holds barred"" Q&A with him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.Buffett, 85, has said in the past that he and the board have agreed on a successor, but he hasn't disclosed who that is. Munger is 92.S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a recent report that Berkshire's growth strategy is continuing to pay off.""Our buy opinion reflects our view that Berkshire's ability to grow its revenue base (both organically and through acquisitions) and maintain margins, despite a mixed economic outlook, will enable the shares to retain their premium valuation"" vs. its peers and the broader market. S&P Capital IQ has a 152 price target on Berkshire's Class B stock.For the full year 2015, net earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion, and revenue grew 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014. Net earnings for the Dec. 31-ended quarter climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share minus one-time items for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in the fourth quarter, well above analyst estimates of $1.75.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for EPS to rise 3% to $1.78 for the current quarter, up from $1.72 in Q1 2015. Berkshire's BNSF Railroad continues to be a drag on earnings amid an oversupplied energy market and plunging coal shipments. BNSF's total railcar units for the week ended April 16 fell by 21% vs. the same quarter a year earlier to about 81,000 units.Berkshire Class B stock hasn't formed a viable base recently. It dropped to an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and has bounced nicely since then. It's risen about 18%, climbing above its 10-week average and 200-day line along the way. Berkshire's B shares closed up less than 0.1% at 146.18 in the stock market today.Berkshire Hathaway boasts a solid 81 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 81% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1051,L,"Charles Schwab (SCHW) investors are happier than investors with other firms. But investors rank the entire financial industry lower than fields such as technology, food and drink, and pharmaceuticals. Investors’ trust in finance is particularly weak in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but strong in India and China.Those are the results of new surveys by the CFA Institute and J.D. Power.Schwab tops the list of 21 financial services companies in a poll of investors for the “2016 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study.” The report, by marketing and information services firm J.D. Power, said, “Schwab has developed an overall client experience that is closely aligned with the evolving priorities of today’s full-service investor.” The next most popular firms, in order, were Edward Jones, Fidelity Investments and UBS (UBS) Financial Services.At the bottom of the list are LPL Financial (LPLA), PNC (PNC) Wealth Management, Lincoln (LNC) Financial Network and, lowest of all, Voya Financial (VOYA).The financial services industry as a whole ranks below most other industries in “From Trust to Loyalty: A Global Survey of What Investors Want in 2016.” The survey comes from the CFA Institute, which calls itself “a global association of investment professionals.”The technology world ranks at the top; 77% of the survey’s respondents (3,312 retail investors from 10 countries and 502 institutional investors from six countries) say that they trust the tech industry “to do what is right.” In second place (68%) comes the food and beverage industry, followed by brewing and spirits (65%), pharmaceuticals (64%), banks (63%) and telecommunications, energy and consumer packaged goods (62% each).Financial services ranked under all of those industries: 61% of retail investors and 57% of institutional investors said that they trusted the industry.The survey’s other industries were automotive (60%), entertainment (55%) and, coming in dead last, media (47%).The level of trust varied from country to country, the CFA Institute reported. In India, 90% of the survey respondents said that they trust the financial services industry. Just below India was China (89%). From there, the level of trust fell hard: only 64% in Canada and Hong Kong, 63% in Singapore, 55% in France, 54% in the United States, 50% in Australia, 44% in the U.K. and 40% in Germany.

1056,L,"It wasn’t so long ago that everyone knew Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be the Republican party’s nominee for president. Now that he may very well be the nominee, everyone knows he couldn’t possibly win in November.Indeed, everyone knows he’ll lose in a Goldwater-esque landslide, handing the White House and the Congress to the Democrats.But what if that’s wrong, too? What if he wins? Well, in that case, everyone knows he would be a disaster as president.I’m considering this from the standpoint of an investor. At first glance, it would seem that there are only bleak choices here for the U.S. economy.If Trump loses and costs the GOP control of Congress, we face at least two years of Democratic one-party rule like 2009-2010. Get ready for higher taxes, more federal regulations, single-payer national health care, union card-check, a ban on fracking and a Supreme Court stacked left for a generation.If Trump wins, get ready for protectionism and lots of it, and a raft of other loony ad hoc populist assaults on the economy.Sell everything? Maybe. But then again, maybe what everyone knows is wrong. After all, Trump must have something going for him, given his “yuge” success in the primaries so far.So maybe it’s time to have a little sympathy for the devil. You remember the iconic Rolling Stones song by that name. Its opening line is kind of like the Trump campaign -- “Please allow me to introduce myself, I’m a man of wealth and taste.” Okay, on the taste part, not so much.But Trump does introduce himself as a man of wealth, and that simple fact speaks volumes about what it would be like to have him as president.In the last election, Mitt Romney spent his entire campaign apologizing for his wealth, groveling to the Left’s narrative that branded him an avatar of white privilege. Romney lost because, in the end, he offered only the defeatist vision embodied in President Obama’s “you didn’t build that.”Trump couldn’t be more different. As a real estate developer, he did, literally, build that. And he’s proud of it, bragging “I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney.”It is often said that no candidate of either party is substantively engaging with the mission of re-igniting American economic growth. It’s true -- for almost two decades, all candidates of both parties have ritually conceded that America is in permanent economic decline and hid or apologized for whatever success they may have had personally.Trump is the first pro-growth candidate of the new millennium, and his policy platform begins with unapologetically offering himself as an aspirational example.Yes, obviously, in an important sense Trump appeals to the worst in people. But that’s hardly unique among politicians, especially the current crop. What is unique is that Trump is also appealing to the best in people. Trump’s seemingly jingoistic slogan “Make America Great Again” is a political inflection point as significant as Deng Xiaoping’s exhortation “To Get Rich is Glorious” was for China’s capitalist rebirth.The leftist economist John Maynard Keynes wasn’t right about much, but he was right when he laid out this enduring axiom of economics: “Our decisions to do something positive … can only be taken as the result of animal spirits -- a spontaneous urge to action.”For all the bluster and buffoonery, Trump’s campaign -- his very persona -- has the effect of letting it be OK for Americans to embrace their inner animal without fear that economic achievement will brand you as a greedy racist polluting imperialist.The bluster and the buffoonery are an integral part of his pro-growth program. Trump’s relentless -- sometimes tasteless -- assault against political correctness is an antidote against the guilt-trip that the Left uses to terrorize and suppress the animal spirits of capitalism.It’s not just atmospherics. Trump has put forth a tax plan as specific as that of any candidate. No less an authority than Reaganomics guru Arthur Laffer said: “It’s a great plan. And I think it’s better or pretty close to as good as Reagan’s.”Trump’s plan calls for a top personal tax rate of 25%, a capital gains rate of 20% and a top corporate rate of 15%. I don’t know of many pro-growth supply-siders who wouldn’t crawl across broken glass to get that enacted into law.To be sure, Trump’s plan has a protectionist edge to it. It calls for a one-time 10% wealth tax on corporate cash held overseas, whether or not it is repatriated. That’s bad news for American multinationals that keep cash overseas to fund operations there -- but then again, having the top corporate rate drop from 35% to 15% would likely ease their pain.Trump’s protectionist tendencies are the dark side of his economics. Happily, his opponents have been eager to point out his seeming hypocrisy here, noting that he hires foreign workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Such hypocrisy is a feature, not a bug. It’s encouraging that he admits shamelessly that employers must do such things, saying that “otherwise, you hurt your business.”Indeed, as the current Beltway joke goes, his two marriages to immigrants show that he understands there are some jobs Americans don’t want to do.If Trump faces Hillary Clinton in the general election, no doubt she’ll haul out the TV commercial that Lyndon Johnson used against Barry Goldwater in 1964, showing a little girl holding a daisy, consumed by a mushroom cloud. Trump is a madman, she will shout, at the same time as she rails against capitalism and Wall Street while denying her family’s own wealth.Meanwhile, Trump will run as a madman for capitalism. He just might win. And by unleashing America’s animal spirits, he just might turn out to be the most effective pro-growth president since Reagan.Luskin is chief investment officer of Trend Macrolytics LLC in Chicago, a strategic consultant to institutional investors.

1060,L,"LGI Homes (LGIH) reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday. Shares initially peeked out to a buy zone, but then reversed sharply as investors focused on the homebuilder's weaker-than-expected revenue.

Revenue grew 36% to $162.5 million as home closings grew 26% to 844 homes. But revenue was lighter than estimates for $167.8 million. Also gross profit margin was 26.7%, down a bit from 27.8% in Q1 2015.The Woodlands, Texas-based homebuilder's profit spike benefited from a 7% rise in its average home selling price to $192,491, largely on changes in product mix and a favorable pricing environment. “We continue to see strong demand for home ownership across the country,"" Chairman and CEO Eric Lipar said in a written statement.LGI Homes shares rose to 30.35 after the opening bell, moving above a 29.87 buy point intraday for a second straight day.

1069,L,"If conventional wisdom ruled in this election cycle thus far, America's most prominent journalists would have painted the traditional portrait of the candidates. They would show Hillary Clinton and the Democrats warmly reminding the country of her husband's allegedly centrist presidency. Whoever the Republicans nominated would either be declared by the media as too conservative to win, or be utterly ruined by trying to placate those crazy Tea Party people who inevitably make the moderates unelectable.But Clinton's long and frustrating march to put away her socialist competitor Bernie Sanders has disrupted the narrative. She cannot package herself as centrist. The media elite will admit Sanders has dragged her to the left. But that doesn't mean her increasing leftism could damage the Democratic Party with independent voters.Consider the liberal-media huddle they call ""Washington Week"" on PBS. On April 15, Time magazine's Washington bureau chief, Michael Scherer, was blunt.""There's the race for delegates, which Bernie Sanders is losing and Hillary is winning and almost certainly will win,"" Scherer said. ""But there's this other race between them about how far left he could push her. And every time she moved a little bit, he seemed to celebrate and get the crowd going and say, 'Look, see, I did that, she said $15-an-hour minimum wage instead of $12.' ... It's not that she wouldn't be happy if (this) came true, but, you know, she's created a very modulated campaign so far.""Actually, that's contradictory on its face. She  wanted  to create a very modulated campaign, but has capitulated instead, and not just on economic issues. The Clintons have been dragged away from Bill Clinton's crime bill and welfare reform in the wake of the onslaught of the Black Lives Matter movement.On the same PBS show, New York Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin implied that bowing to the radical left is simply acknowledging reality: ""It's a reflection of today's Democratic Party that that's what she has to get to. She doesn't have a choice in the matter. She has got to accommodate a party that is very different today than it was when Bill Clinton ran, you know, in '92.""At no time in this insular little bubble conversation did they talk about consequences. Drifting too far to the left doomed the Democratic candidates in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2004.Liberal reporters like Sanders' influence on Clinton. They equate socialism with the conscience of the country. His candidacy is welcome because it's pushing her toward the radical positioning they favor.This is why Sanders has outperformed Clinton when pitted against the Republican candidates in head-to-head polls. Because he's still perceived by some as having little chance of winning the nomination, no one is really bothering to hammer him for being extreme, and not much focus has been put on the nagging hypocrisy that he's a millionaire with two homes and donated only 4% of his income to charity.They've loved Sanders from the start. In February 2015, ABC's David Wright gushed that Sanders is ""as unabashedly progressive as Ben & Jerry's. ... Sanders rails against the corrupting influence of money in politics. He stands for economic justice. ... He's not just for raising the minimum wage, he wants to double it.""If forced to describe someone who is as staunchly on the right as Sanders is on the left, ABC probably wouldn't sound delighted. They would need a motion-sickness bag to get through it. The media's location on the ideological spectrum is so close to Ben and Jerry's you can almost taste the Cherry Garcia. Never trust it to tell the public who's the extremist and who is not.

1071,L,"Most of the major indexes finished with small gains Monday, but such action cloaked big moves among the Chinese Internets including market leader Weibo (WB) (down nearly 6%) as well as peers Baidu (BIDU) (off 2.6%) and online retail play JD.com (JD) (down 7%).The Nasdaq edged 0.3% higher, ahead of the S&P 500's 0.1% lift. The Dow Jones industrials fell 0.2%, after losing just 0.2% last week. Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) slumped 3.5% in heavy trading to 70.78, sinking back below its 200-day moving average for the first time since mid-March. The mining and construction gear giant recently posted its fourth quarter in a row of falling earnings per share (Q1 EPS of 67 cents, down 68%). It gets a horrible 13 EPS Rating out of a maximum 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.All three indexes declined last week. Volume shrank on both exchanges Monday, according to preliminary data.In the stock market today, building-related firms still showed bullish action. LGI Homes (LGIH), which reports Q1 results early on Tuesday, gained nearly 5% to 29.60, flirting with a 29.87 handle buy point. The cup itself is more than six months long, within the usual time length, and the RS line is rising fast, a good sign.The RS line graphs a stock's ability to outperform the S&P 500. If, for instance, on a down day for the market, a stock falls less than the S&P 500, then its RS line will still rise because it shows relative outperformance. The Texas-based homebuilder, featured in a recent IBD Sector Leaders column, features one significant flaw in its base -- the drop from high to low is excessive. Most great cup-with-handle base breakouts occur when the depth of the decline is limited to 33% to 35% or less.Back to Chinese stocks, the Internets all soured amid a 2.8% shellacking of the Shanghai Composite. At 2832, the benchmark hit its lowest close since March 11. Chinese equities sank on poor export and import data.Social media giant Weibo, which has been frequently showcased in IBD's Global Leaders column (which as of May 2 is now a weekly feature), fell nearly 6% to 21.55. With volume rising to double its normal average, it is triggering a sell signal because Weibo is quickly giving back its double-digit gains from a powerful April 6 breakout past a 19.20 cup-with-handle entry.While Weibo's Composite and RS ratings are still top-notch, do not use these ratings to time your stock sells. They are most useful during the stock selection and purchase process.For short-term traders, Weibo notched an early sell signal when it fell definitively below its short-term 10-day moving average around 23.84 on May 3, also in above-average turnover. IBD Leaderboard annotates charts of select leading stocks and notes this special sell signal on daily charts when the sell rule is triggered.

1072,L,"Now that it looks like the GOP nomination won't be decided until a contested convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump and his supporters assert that the whole system is undemocratic.But if democracy was organized to give everyone a fair and equal shot to impress voters with their knowledge and experience, then our system has been rigged for Trump for the last nine months. The media -- not just the liberal media, but some ""conservative"" media, too -- have been the gale-force wind beneath Trump's wings.On the nightly news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC, Trump has far outpaced anyone other GOP candidate for attention. From last July through April 6, he's drawn 1,228 minutes of airtime, or 56% of the total coverage of the Republican primary race. The other 16 candidates have split the remaining 44%. Trump's closest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, has only been granted 269 minutes of airtime, or 12%. That's roughly a 5-to-1 disparity. Gov. John Kasich has received only 46 minutes, or 2.1% of the Republican nightly news pie. Even when Cruz or Kasich win a primary, the dominant story is Trump stumbling, not them winning. It's Trump or virtually nothing by design.The media carnival for Trump was intense in the beginning, with the reality TV star getting 71% of the coverage in July and August last year. Now we're late in the primaries and nothing's changed. When the field shrunk to three candidates in March, Trump surged again with 72% of the coverage. He was given 267 minutes of airtime, compared to just 52 minutes for Cruz (14%) and a mere 18 minutes for Kasich (4.8%).Even in the first week of April, when Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump drew 74.5% of news minutes. Overall, Trump has received more than four times the coverage as Cruz, and 26 times more times than Kasich. Forget about fairness and balance. Anyone who tunes in is aware that the networks' coverage of Trump is often negative, but they still deny airtime to his opponents.Defenders of this overcoverage insist that Trump is the most newsworthy one, so his actions make the most news. But the problem is not just the quantity of Trump segments, but the quality. Reporters let his bluster and theatrics dominate, and they ignore the substance of his assertions.Take the delegate selection in Colorado. News headlines everywhere covered Trump complaining that the Colorado primary was rigged, saying, ""I'm hundreds of delegates ahead, but the system, folks, is rigged. It's a rigged, disgusting, dirty system."" What was not news, except as a rejoinder by a Cruz partisan (whose very presence cast suspicion on the veracity of the ""opinion""), is that Trump is not being truthful.Colorado established its delegate rules last August, and Trump either didn't have an organization in the state, or he didn't care. The real story is Trump dishonestly crying foul about every state he loses: Every loss is due to stupid voters and/or a corrupt process. Show us how many networks have made that a story.In effect, the media have handed Trump the microphone and let him say whatever he wants about anything he wishes. It has granted him credibility no matter how outrageous the claim, and has let him control the campaign narrative.It's quite possible in the coming months that, even if Trump is denied the nomination, he will continue to dominate the narrative. Just as he still dominates after Cruz wins primaries, he could dominate if someone else becomes the nominee, by constantly needling whoever took his place. Whether or not he could succeed or even run as a third-party candidate, the media could continue to let Trump's commentary on the campaign dominate.Let's have full disclosure here: We have personally endorsed Ted Cruz, which for some might cast doubt on this column. But we challenge you to dispute any of what is written above.

1074,L,"Gap (GPS) shares tumbled Friday following the release of disappointing March sales figures, joining apparel companies like L Brands (LB) and Michael Kors (KORS) that are also selling off below key levels of support.Late Thursday, Gap reported a system-wide 6% same-store sales decline for March, swinging from 2% growth in the prior year. Gap brand comps fell 3%, Banana Republic comps dove 14%, and Old Navy fell 6%.The company also said it is ""entering April with more inventory than planned, which the company expects will pressure its gross margin rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.""Gap's management is optimistic about new merchandise, FBR analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a Friday note. ""However, the turnaround visibility remains low and could be further out than anticipated, given time needed to regain the consumer and a highly competitive environment.""Gap shares had managed to touch their 200-day line in March after taking support at the key 50-day level in mid-February, but Friday's 13.8% dive sent the stock well below the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Victoria's Secret parent L Brands sank 4.3%, following a 2.3% dip Thursday after announcing restructuring plans.

The economic trend may be “L-shaped,” meaning flat growth, rather than a stronger “U-shaped” recovery, said the People’s Daily. Even so, the article said the government will not use excessive investment or rapid credit expansion to stimulate growth.One concern among China observers is the country's widespread debt.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, in a research report published Monday, referred to global investor George Soros' remarks in April that China’s situation marks an “eerie resemblance” to the U.S. in 2005 to 2008, just before the financial crisis sparked the Great Recession. But BofA sees what it calls a better comparison, looking at Japan in the 1990s.“While there may be some parallels between the precrisis situation in the U.S. and China today, there arguably are even more important differences, including the nature of the increase in credit, extent of contagion risks to the broader economy, and scope for government policy to preclude or offset,” said the report. “Indeed, if we had to identify a historical antecedent for the current situation in China, a more applicable choice might be Japan during the 1990s.""That said, China’s unique situation belies any simple comparison with past crises in either developed or emerging markets, and warrants its own more in-depth investigation.”Another concern is increased scrutiny on the number of U.S.-listed China tech companies that plan to go private or delist in the U.S. in favor of China markets, where they have expected they could see higher valuations.China has said it is ""reviewing market concerns about a record wave of businesses seeking higher mainland valuations with relistings there,"" Bloomberg reported Sunday.Among companies with such plans, Momo (MOMO) stock plunged 16% Monday, while YY (YY) tumbled 14%.

1078,L,"Stocks quickly trimmed early losses roughly an hour into Wednesday's session as a raft of data on the U.S. economy inspired some buying. Meanwhile, mid-cap biotech Medivation (MDVN) continued to rally amid speculation that it's still an acquisition target.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.4%, after being down as much as 0.7% shortly after the open. The Dow Jones industrials eased 0.2%. The small-cap S&P 600 turned higher after the initial sell-off, but it later retreated again and is down 0.4%.The market began to turn higher on news that the ISM services sector survey for April came in at 55.7, above the Econoday consensus forecast of 54.7. A figure above 50 indicates expanding activity. U.S. factory orders in March, meanwhile, rose 1.1%, well above the 0.6% growth forecast, while the Markit PMI services index also beat expectations (52.8 vs. 52.0).The Dow utilities also bucked the market's decline, adding 0.5% to a roughly 0.9% advance over the prior two sessions. Volume is running mildly lower on both sides vs. the same time on Tuesday.Among leading new companies, regional homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) cooled off with a 1% loss to 27.49. The Texas-based small cap has been building a base of its own after it went on a big spurt in the second half of 2015. Its Aug. 5, 2015, breakout past a 20.20 entry yielded a nearly 79% rally over 17 weeks before the stock began to correct off its 36.07 high.LGI, which focuses on young families seeking to exit the apartment world, is now 23% below that peak. In normal circumstances, a high-quality stock will rally to within 5% to 15% below its 52-week or all-time peak, form a handle, then bust out of that base. However, the probabilities of such success are diminished amid the pressured uptrend. On the Nasdaq itself, there have been six distribution days, or bouts of heavy institutional selling, over the past 11 sessions alone.On the upside, Medivation rose 2% to 58.69 in volume running more than triple its normal pace. Medivation's average daily volume of 3.95 million shares means that on an hourly basis, 610,000 of its shares are traded on average. As of 10:25 a.m. ET, Medivation's turnover had already hit 1.8 million shares.The San Francisco-based company strives to produce brand-new medicines by developing four to six product candidates that, upon acquisition, have the potential to go into clinical development within 12 to 18 months. Reports that Pfizer (PFE), which issued solid results on Tuesday and gapped up as a result, may be looking to acquire Medivation have been acting like a strong tailwind for the stock. Pfizer is up marginally but is showing good action after Tuesday's breakout past a 33.60 entry point.Medivation's fourth-quarter profit surged 164% to 29 cents a share on a 37% revenue boost to $378 million. Wall Street sees Q1 profit up 130% to 23 cents a share, which would mark an eighth straight quarter of excellent earnings. On March 31, Medivation shares rocketed above its 200-day moving average, taking a large step in the process of forming a positive base pattern. Now, it's been working on the right side of a giant cup for the past three months. The stock is currently 17% below an all-time high of 70.79.Medivation scores a 98 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 by IBD Stock Checkup, which means that its combination of fundamentals, stock price action and institutional fund sponsorship is superior to 98% of all companies in IBD's vast database.

It rose as much as 3% intraday before closing up 1.6% at 27.98 on the stock market today.LGI is due to report first-quarter results next Tuesday. Analysts' consensus is for earnings per share minus one-time items to jump 58% to 52 cents on a 39% hike in revenue to $167.6 million. The company is growing rapidly beyond its Lone Star state home base, and investors will key in on Q2 prospects as it expands into Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and other states.Meanwhile, Installed Building Products, which installs garage doors, rain gutters, shower doors and the like for homebuilders, reported Q1 earnings early Thursday that crushed estimates.Installed Building Products earned 19 cents a share -- 21 cents excluding various items -- vs. 5 cents in the same quarter last year. Either way, it's explosive growth and far above views for 11 cents.Revenue climbed nearly 48% to $191.7 million, well above Wall Street's expectation for $174 million and the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth.Installed Building Products shares shot up 11.6% to 29.67, hitting a record 31.06 intraday.

1084,L,"Nuclear Iran: Tehran's defense minister says the terrorist state will produce a massive explosive used to detonate atomic bombs. Obama's Iran deal is increasingly delivering the opposite of its promises.Why would Iran want to produce the nuclear weapons detonator Octogen, also known as HMX, or ""high melting point explosive,"" if it doesn't have its eyes on becoming a nuclear weapons power?Moreover, why is Tehran seeking HMX only three months after official implementation of the nuclear pact that the West negotiated with it (without Iran signing it, though)? Clearly, pursuing Octogen earlier would have been a red flag indicating that Iran's claims of not seeking nuclear weapons were false.Iran's military ""has put on its agenda the acquisition of the technical know-how to produce Octogen explosive materials and Octogen-based weapons,"" Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan announced on Wednesday at the formal opening of an explosives production plant in Tehran.Iran having HMX weakens deal proponents' persistent argument that the agreement's ""one year or longer breakout timeline"" for approximately 10 years means the pact makes the world safer. Having a nuclear detonator ready to go means Iran becoming a nuclear weapons power faster.A December 2015 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear ""watchdog,"" concluded that ""exploding bridge wire"" detonators ""developed by Iran have characteristics relevant to a nuclear explosive device"" and that Iran was conducting nuclear weapons research all the way into the first year of the Obama presidency.HMX isn't exclusively used for nukes, but the seriousness with which the IAEA takes it was on full view early during the Iraq War.  As the New York Times reported regarding the disappearance of hundreds of tons of HMX from the Saddam Hussein regime's huge al-Qaqaa facility in 2004,"" Mr. Hussein's engineers acquired HMX and RDX (rapid detonation explosive) when they embarked on a crash effort to build an atomic bomb in the late 1980s. . . . Weapon inspectors determined that Iraq had bought the explosives from France, China and Yugoslavia, a European diplomat said.""And in February 2003, ""nine days after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented his arms case to the Security Council,"" then-IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize, ""reported that the agency had found no sign of new atom endeavors"" by Iraq, ""but 'has continued to investigate the relocation and consumption of the high explosive HMX,' "" the Times story noted. ""Dr. ElBaradei, a European diplomat said, is 'extremely concerned' about the potentially 'devastating consequences' of the vanished stockpile.""The newspaper also pointed out that HMX's ""benign appearance makes it easy to disguise as harmless goods, easily slipped across borders,"" and that it is ""used in standard nuclear weapons design.""So not only is HMX of grave concern regarding Iran's own nuclear weapons ambitions; it could help any of the many terrorist groups Iran finances in their atomic aspirations.It was already known that Obama's deal was defective on the issue of nuclear detonators; the HMX announcement makes it clear Tehran is taking full advantage.

The company will retain its 14% corporate tax rate, he said, and it should also be free to deploy capital however it chooses.Saunders also said Allergan's $40 billion sale of its generic unit Actavis to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) is unaffected by the spiking of the Pfizer deal and is on track to close in June. The timeline for that buyout was delayed from its original Q1 closing date, as Teva works its way through a multi-country regulatory clearance process, but Saunders said the two companies are determined to get it done.""Teva is doing a lot of work,"" said Saunders. ""They've restructured their company; they have named their entire leadership through a few levels that include 200 Allergan executives moving to Teva. ... This is a great deal for Allergan, but also a great deal for Teva.""Allergan stock, down 15% Tuesday, rebounded 3.5% Wednesday, to 244.74. Teva stock rose 4% to 56.73.The closing of the Actavis sale should give Allergan a big wad of cash, so many of the analysts' questions on the call related to what it will do with the money. Several seemed to be rooting for share buybacks, given that Allergan stock is trading near a 52-week low in the wake of the Pfizer breakup.Saunders said all options are on the table, but he emphasized that Allergan's ""growth pharma"" model means that it's constantly on the hunt for growth assets. He said that Allergan's business-development team has stayed active since the Pfizer deal was announced, and if the right opportunity came along ""we could announce it tomorrow.""A couple of analysts raised the name of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb, with which Saunders has a personal history. He headed the company from 2010 until 2013, when it was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) for $8.7 billion. Given Valeant's recent spectacular crackup, many on Wall Street have speculated that B&L might again go on sale, with Allergan a suitable buyer not only because of Saunders, but also because of Allergan's large ophthalmology business.Saunders' response to this seemed to be a swipe at Valeant's infamously opaque financial reporting.""It sold for $8.7 billion three, four years ago, with a late-stage pipeline of 30-some programs, and a strong organic growth profile,"" he said. ""I can't tell that any of those things today are still true. Based on public information, it's impossible to tell that it's worth more than it sold for four years ago.""Pfizer, meanwhile, rose 5% to 32.93, hitting a four-month high, as investors looked toward another possible major catalyst for its stock. Back in 2013, the company reorganized so that it would be able to split its innovative drug-development business from its established products, and perhaps divide itself into more pieces if necessary. The company had originally planned to make a decision on that this year, but when the Allergan buyout was announced, the issue was pushed into next year. In Pfizer's press release announcing the end of the Allergan deal, however, it said the decision date is back to this year.That itself could bring some more M&A, writes Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum.""After a recent acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer probably has critical mass to transform its Global Established Products business unit to an independent company, but Innovative Products business units might benefit from additional assets acquired from outside,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.The prospects of both companies going back on the hunt may have been what lifted drug stocks as a whole Wednesday, especially biotechs. Distressed big-cap biotech Biogen (BIIB), which has been subject to buyout speculation given that it's trading 35% off its high, rose 5.3% to 279.57. Smaller Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) rose 16% to 73.20, likely because its late-stage eczema drug is seen as a fit for Allergan's dermatology portfolio.

1089,L,"Express may not have the cachet of power brands like Nike and Under Armour, but the specialty retailer of clothing for consumers ages 20-30 thinks it has elevated its image among millennials using some of the same marketing tactics.Express (EXPR) has signed sports stars and models to serve as ""brand ambassadors,"" a variation on the promotions used by such sportswear giants as Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE). The effort may never become part of the public conversation like Nike's famed ""Air Jordan"" campaign featuring basketball great Michael Jordan, but it is unusual for fashion retailers to employ the move.All-Star third baseman Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs signed on in March with Express. He joins supermodel Kate Upton and Golden State Warriors basketball guard Steph Curry -- arguably the best player in the game today. Curry and Upton became brand ambassadors in 2014.""Express recognized the value of elevating a brand around ambassadors,"" Nomura Securities senior analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""The athletic companies do that very well, but generally speaking, mall-based fashion companies have not utilized that approach. Express has embraced that and is appealing to millennials.""It's just one tactic Express is using to create buzz in the hotly competitive fashion retail arena. Since taking the helm in January 2015, Chief Executive David Kornberg has implemented a number of initiatives that have vaulted the company's financial performance after some years of tough times.His efforts are bearing fruit. Express has logged four straight quarters of at least double-digit earnings growth. Now, after a strong performance in 2015, Express is expected to keep up its winning streak.Kornberg has a number of new initiatives on tap, including the launch of new planning systems expected to come online soon, an upgrade to its e-commerce experience and a continued rollout of its off-price store concept.It also is improving store productivity through individual outlet closures. Express closed 27 stores in 2015, and another 17 are set for closure in fiscal 2016. It now operates more than 650 retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and in Canada.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Express to see a 16% rise in earnings this year to $1.68 a share after an 79% year-over-year earnings gain in 2015. They forecast a 9% increase in 2017.But it could take some doing for Express to keep up the momentum, say analysts.""(The year) 2015 benefited from a regime change that drove some really strong improvements in the business in its first year,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Paul Alexander told IBD. ""I think they harvested a lot of low hanging fruit in 2015, but I don't see as much opportunity in 2016.""""Their goal is to continue to be lean on inventories, to continue to improve the fashion and to continue to be conservative (on the financial front),"" Alexander went on to say. ""This year, they're focused on rolling out state-of-the-art retail systems that should start paying off in 2017.""Kornberg modified the retailer's product makeup to incorporate more fashion items and bring newer fashions more often, as well as expand product categories and launch new collections, he said on the company's recent fourth-quarter conference call.It's no easy feat marketing and selling to millennials in an environment where it is competing for their business with cheap chic ""fast-fashion"" retailers like privately held Forever 21 and Sweden-based H&M.""They're definitely in direct competition for the millennial wallet with the fast-fashion guys,"" said Alexander. He says Express differs from these competitors by offering better quality merchandise and by having an assortment of clothing that covers a ""broad array of occasions,"" from casual and jeans to clothes for work.The company also put in new inventory management, speed-to-market and product testing disciplines. Express also continued to upgrade its systems and processes. And Kornberg laid out a financial plan.""Kornberg put an emphasis on consistent and steady, modest gains in both comps and margins, as opposed to swinging for home runs,"" said Alexander.Alexander sees Express growing earnings over the next few years.""But I worry if they don't get enough benefits out of implementing these new systems, competitive headwinds may weigh on EPS growth, and we will likely see the pace at which they grow earnings moderate,"" Alexander said.For now, Express is on a growth trajectory. One sign of that came during its holiday fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, when earnings jumped 37% to 67 cents a share. Sales increased 5% to $765.6 million. Same-store sales, including e-commerce sales, rose 4% from a year earlier.Total e-commerce sales increased 8% to $156.3 million. Merchandise margin grew by 180 basis points, due to carefully managed promotions and inventory levels, the company said. Its gross margin rose to 34.0% from 31.7% a year earlier.Kornberg, who had been president, added the title of chief executive when Michael Weiss retired after a longtime stint in the post. He immediately set out to make some changes where Express -- which got its start in 1980 as a division of L Brands (LB), formerly Limited Brands -- had been lacking, analysts say.""The new CEO looked at this business and wanted to build a sustainable business model, which involved (reporting) a low-single-digit comp, and on top of that, if they spent a few years updating their systems, then the low-single-digit comp would translate to low double-digit operating income growth,"" said Nomura's Siegel.""The stock is now at a crossroads,"" Siegel said. ""They had a very successful year. Now investors will find out if it was because of the strength of the business, given the right processes are now in place, or if it was simply due to a year of strong products and the right merchandise.""Siegel believes it is the former. He says investors often mistake Express for ""the old, fashion-driven"" company it was as a part of Limited.""Express has the opportunity to see both upward earnings revisions and upward multiple expansion,"" Siegel said. ""I think it is an under-appreciated story. I think the appreciation will come when people see that Express is not the Express of old.""

1090,L,"Apple (AAPL) stock jumped to its highest level of the year on Wednesday after the iPhone maker got two bullish reports that point to better times ahead.Apple stock rose as much as 2.5% to 110.42 in intraday trading on the stock market today. It ended the day at 109.56, up 1.8%. For the year, Apple stock is now up 4.1%. But it is still well below its all-time high of 134.54, reached last April 28.Investment bank Cowen turned positive on Apple stock, upgrading shares to outperform (the equivalent of a buy rating) from market perform (neutral).Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri raised his price target on Apple stock to 135 from 125, on prospects for iPhone sales to perk up starting this fall with the upcoming iPhone 7 series.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino on Tuesday reiterated his strong buy rating on Apple stock based on a positive view of its business prospects.Cowen's Arcuri had been on the sidelines regarding Apple stock for about eight months before his change in sentiment. He says year-over-year comparisons and forward estimates for Apple have bottomed. The company is likely to see a rebound in smartphone sales this fall with the launch of the iPhone 7, as iPhone 6 owners decide to upgrade, he said in a research report.He also is excited about the prospects for Apple to switch to an OLED display from the current LCD screen next year. If Apple makes that move, it could skip its usual S cycle of incremental smartphone improvements and call the next model the iPhone 8 rather than the 7S, Arcuri said.Some on Wall Street expect Apple to move to OLED in 2018, not 2017, but Arcuri is confident that Apple will accelerate its adoption of the technology. Screens with OLED, short for organic light-emitting diode, consume less power than LCD (liquid crystal display) screens and boast richer colors and darker blacks.OLED will give Apple greater freedom on product design because OLED screens are flexible. OLED displays could lead to “dreamy” new form factors for the iPhone, Arcuri said.A future iPhone could feature a display that wraps around the edges of the device, he said. OLED displays also could enable phones in which the screens can fold in half, making a big-screen device more compact.Apple probably would have to source the OLED screens from rival Samsung in the near term, until other manufacturers can scale up production, he said. Other possible OLED suppliers include LG Display (LPL) and Japan Display, he said.Samsung already uses OLED screens in its premium smartphones including the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Apple uses OLED displays for its Apple Watch smartwatches.One company benefiting from the speculation that Apple will move to OLED is Universal Display (OLED), which develops OLED technology for TVs and mobile devices. Shares of the Ewing, N.J.-based company rose 3.9% on Wednesday to 54.76, touching their highest point in 2016.Other companies seen benefiting from greater adoption of OLED screens on smartphones, thanks to Apple, include Applied Materials (AMAT), Orbotech (ORBK) and Synaptics (SYNA), Cowen said.Applied Materials makes equipment for manufacturing displays. Orbotech makes optical-inspection and process-control systems for producing displays. Synaptics is the incumbent supplier of display driver chips for the iPhone and is developing new OLED products this year.Meanwhile, Apple is finishing the design of the iPhone 7. That handset is believed to be waterproof and have a thinner, sleeker look.Apple is rumored to be eliminating, as part of the new design, the phone's home button and audio jack. The pressure-sensitive screen would take the place of the circular home button. People who want to use headphones with the iPhone 7 would have to use wireless Bluetooth headsets or wired headsets that plug into the multipurpose Lightning connector.

1092,L,"Law and Disorder: Gitmo terrorists aren’t the only prisoners President Obama is pardoning. He is also commuting the life sentences of major drug dealers in record numbers, despite the clear and present danger that many of them pose to U.S. citizens.Obama pardoned another 61 prisoners Wednesday, bringing the total number of felons whose sentences he has commuted to 248 -- more than all the previous six presidents going back to Gerald Ford combined.And he is not done yet.More than 10,000 clemency cases are pending, and the president has made approving them his “top priority” in his remaining days in office.""Clemency of individual cases alone cannot fix decades of overly punitive sentencing policies,” his White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, said. ""So while we continue to work to resolve as many clemency applications as possible -- and make no mistake, we are working hard at this -- only broader criminal justice reform can truly bring justice to the many thousands of people behind bars serving unduly harsh and outdated sentences.""Obama claims that none of the felons he is putting back on the streets is a serious offender. But 92 of them -- or nearly 40% of the total pardoned so far -- were serving life sentences. So they’re hardly the “low-level” or “non-violent” criminals that he claims.Almost all of them are crack dealers who have also committed gun crimes. These are dangerous thugs whom judges and juries decided should never be out on the streets again. They were supposed to be locked up for good.At the same time, the Obama regime has also approved the early release of roughly half -- more than 46,000 -- of all drug traffickers in the federal pen, including the kingpin of a multimillion-dollar operation that smuggled drugs from Canada to Maine.Already some of these inmates who had their sentences retroactively slashed have been rearrested -- including at least one for triple homicide. So why is the White House celebrating this reckless mass clemency? And why aren't Republican leaders, both in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, raising alarms?Just last month, a convicted crack dealer who left prison early as part of the Obama administration’s mass release of federal inmates was indicted in connection with the triple murders of his ex-girlfriend and her two young daughters, ages 7 and 10. Wendell L. Callahan, 35, allegedly broke into their Columbus, Ohio, apartment and brutally and fatally stabbed all three victims, while seriously injuring a fourth person.Callahan should have been in jail when the crimes occurred, but he was released several years early, thanks to Obama’s sympathy for crack dealers.Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the heinous crime, which also involved burglary, so this time there will be no chance for clemency.This sudden outrageous leniency afforded crack dealers is part of Obama’s crusade to “reform"" the nation’s criminal justice system as a way of ending alleged racial discrimination in policing and sentencing, even though federal studies dispute charges of racial bias in law enforcement.Over the next several years, long after Obama is gone, wave after wave of drug dealers, many of them members of violent gangs, will flood American streets -- including in the U.S. capital, where drug-related shootings are on the rise again.Meanwhile, Obama has instructed prosecutors to go easy on new drug offenders. What message are drug traffickers and drug cartels hearing from this newfound leniency? That the streets of America are open for business again.Yes, many criminals deserve a second chance -- but only after they've paid their full debts to society. By rewarding thousands of felons with get-out-of-jail cards, Obama is threatening public safety.
"
1093,L,"Jeb Bush was hardly the first politician to amass huge sums of money only to see his presidential campaign implode. But his departure from the race last weekend has served as an opportunity for media members to blame Republican voters for the exit.""The Republican race snipped its strongest tether to decency when Jeb Bush bowed out Saturday night,"" lamented Seth Stevenson in Slate.A USA Today editorial observed that ""big chunks of the party are in revolt against experienced, even-keeled leaders."" And a Wall Street Journal analysis said Bush failed ""for one reason: He was the wrong candidate for this moment.""Again, blame it on the surely crazy Republican base.All this seems very unfair to ""small L” libertarians who are uncomfortable with the policies of both Democrats and Republicans. It also reads as a misanalysis, because such a view asks GOP voters to forget a presidency and a period that, for good reason, remains fresh in their minds.A rejection of Jeb Bush was a reasonable move on the part of Republican voters perhaps eager to loudly express their opinion about the last Bush (George W.) to hold the U.S.'s highest elective office.Is it any wonder at all that whatever his experience, policy knowledge and decency, Jeb was never viable owing to the disaster authored by his brother?Lest we forget, it was George W. Bush who signed the business-suffocating Sarbanes-Oxley law, bragging at the time it was the toughest anti-business ""crime"" law since the days of FDR, and the McCain-Feingold bill that restricted free speech.And with a Republican Congress largely in control of the purse, it was Bush who never vetoed obnoxiously large budgets, not to mention his signing of a rather expensive prescription drug benefit.Speaking of the health-care-related, it was also Bush who appointed as chief justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts, the judge who twice found ways to save President Obama's signature health law. And has anyone forgotten Bush's pre-Roberts pick of Harriet Miers?It was Bush who foisted on us a cruel economic ""blessing"" in the form of Ben Bernanke; imposed tariffs on steel, shrimp and softwood lumber all the while bashing China, and allowed his Treasury to pursue an economy-crushing devaluation of the dollar that authored an economy-strangling rush into the consumption of housing.And then, when the markets revealed the horrors of policies meant to boost housing consumption (he signed the American Dream Downpayment Act in 2003, given his belief that ""it is in our national interest that more people own their own home""), and rather than allowing the capitalist system to fix the policy errors he had a role in, Bush, working with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Bernanke, decided to blame the markets for “not functioning properly"" and bailed out financial institutions that the free markets had decided were not worth saving.In committing their egregious bailout errors, Bush, Bernanke and Paulson engineered a wholly unnecessary ""financial crisis"" that had nothing to do with capitalism and everything to do with them running away from it. And in blocking the infinite and very curative wonders of the marketplace, they deprived our economy of a much more substantial recovery.Foreign policy? While there are myriad views about what the proper response to 9/11 should have been, the 43rd president somehow concluded that wars meant to spread democracy in the Middle East were what would do the most to keep us safe.As the years go by, it's increasingly difficult to defend his response. But arguably the most compelling defense of Bush is that he was forced to make quick decisions in a wholly new world. Fair enough there, but that's why we elect presidents in the first place: to make very few very tough decisions.Ideally, the White House occupant (and federal government more broadly) would be inconsequential with regard to matters economic while intensely focused on the defense of the United States.An expensive (in terms of blood and treasure) attempt to fix a part of the world that reads as unfixable perhaps had voters a tad skeptical about Jeb's assertion that ""W"" kept us safe.After that, Republican voters plainly don't like Barack Obama. But we have a lousy president because the Republicans proved in the 2000s that they could easily match the Democrats when it came to inept policymaking. George W. Bush was and is the face of lousy policymaking that gave us President Obama.It is frequently said that of the 2016 candidates, Jeb had the best policy chops relative to Donald Trump's near incoherence. But is it possible that wise minds are missing the point?This writer would eagerly challenge anyone when it comes to most clearly exposing the jaw-dropping stupidity behind Trump's assertions about immigrants, a ""wall"" to allegedly keep them out, not to mention the certain danger of levying tariffs on China.But at the same time, this same writer would gladly take on any Republican partisan eager to debate the worse president of the two: George W. Bush or Barack Obama. In a reasoned discussion, Bush would come out on top as the worst, and it wouldn't even be close.Thinking about Trump, is it possible that voters don't so much like him as they can't stand W? Confused as he often sounds, Trump is at least willing to state the obvious about the last Republican to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania. Why haven't other GOP candidates been more explicit?It's often said that Trump gets a lot of free media, but can anyone doubt the free media that would have come the way of the Republican willing to speak the truth about W's presidency?Had Jeb been willing to state the obvious about his brother's train wreck, he wouldn't have needed to raise all the money he did. Voluminous media that would have made Trump's seem small by comparison would have followed him and printed/filmed his every word.Yet Jeb was perhaps too ""decent"" or loyal to admit his brother's myriad failings? Fair enough, but why all the opposite-of-decent attacks on his former mentee in Marco Rubio?After that, wouldn't a truly decent Jeb have told the money people behind his own version of ""shock and awe"" that the office of the president is too important to be besmirched by dynasties?Wouldn't he have announced his intention to not run early on so that human and financial resources might have been more reasonably divided up among others not Bush?Couldn't Republicans not Trump have been more vocal about and debated more the many errors of Bush '43 had Jeb not been in the race?These are all questions worth at least considering. In the ultimate sign of tone-deafness, Jeb had George W. out to South Carolina to stump for him at the same time and in the same state that Trump was bashing W.Trump emerged from South Carolina the front runner, while Jeb suspended his campaign. Unrelated? Perhaps not.Republicans won't be credible until they freely acknowledge the disaster overseen by W. Trump has, and he's winning. Perhaps it's time for his opponents to start stating the obvious.Tamny is political economy editor at Forbes, editor of RealClearMarkets, a senior fellow in economics at Reason Foundation and a senior economic advisor to Toreador Research & Trading.

1094,L,"Chipmakers, chip designers and chip equipment makers have been showing strength in the current stock market.As of Friday’s IBD, the semiconductor manufacturing group was No. 27 among 197 industry groups. Three weeks ago the group also was No. 27 and six weeks ago No. 28. So chipmaker stocks are keeping their grip.The fabless chip designer group is No. 29. Three and six weeks ago, the group’s rank was No. 26 and No. 44 respectively. These rankings also show stamina.The semiconductor equipment group is No. 16 and rated 14th and 23rd three and six weeks ago -- again solidly positioned.What’s the deal with chip stocks?Chips aren’t getting a great deal of attention right now because they have had a hard act to follow.In 2014, global sales jumped 9.9% vs. 2013, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. At $335.8 billion, it was the highest sales ever.However, 2015 sales eased 0.2%. And in Q4, sales were 5.2% below the year-earlier pace.In a press release Feb. 1, Semiconductor Industry Association President and CEO John Neuffer said, “Factors that limited more robust sales in 2015 include softening demand, the strength of the dollar, and normal market trends and cyclicality. In spite of these challenges, modest market growth is projected for 2016.”Data for January is expected to be released in early March.One factor that could help the chip sector long term is legislation that Congress passed recently. The legislation permanently extends the research and development tax credit.Neuffer called the legislation “a huge win” for the chip sector.The permanent aspect is regarded as important because it allows the industry to plan ahead.Which stocks in the three chip groups are worth attention now?Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) is the leader in chipmaker group. The small-cap stock has a Composite Rating of 98, the highest rating in the group. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 98 puts the stock in the top 2 percentile.Earnings in fiscal 2016, ending in September, are expected to leap 52%.Columbia Acorn A Fund (LACAX) opened a new position in Q4.Chartwise, the stock is working on a pattern that looks like a double-bottom on the daily chart.Small cap play MaxLinear (MXL) has the best ratings in the chip designer group. The Composite Rating is 99.Earnings are expected to grow 26% this year.MaxLinear’s chart also looks like a double-bottom base on the daily chart. It is just under a 16.29 entry.Big cap KLA Tencor (KLAC) has the best rating in the chip equipment maker group among the stocks with good liquidity. Its Composite Rating is 98.Earnings are expected to grow 28% in fiscal 2016 ending in June.KLA is working on a shallow double bottom within a larger consolidation.

1095,L,"It's part a lack of resources overseas and part simple disinterest at home, but the American news media seemingly are out of the business of covering international news. For example, one of the most neglected international stories is the attempt by ISIS to exterminate and persecute Christians.Instead, our media obsess over the faintest hint of domestic ""Islamophobia."" A few weeks ago, The New York Times filed a national story from Arizona with this incident: ""Rania Kanawati, a Syrian immigrant, was walking to her car after Friday prayer last month at the Islamic Center of Tucson when a beer can landed right behind her, then another one fell by her side."" The headline was ""University of Arizona Students Hurl Insults, and Litter, at Mosque in Tucson."" No one was physically hurt.At about the same time, some Christian in the Middle East was probably being crucified or set on fire.On March 4, the Associated Press reported, ""Gunmen in southern Yemen on Friday stormed a retirement home run by a charity established by Mother Teresa, killing 16 people, including four Catholic nuns."" Network coverage? Zero on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, NPR, CNN, MSNBC and Fox. At least The New York Times and The Washington Post offered stories, although the Post offered only 94 words.Pope Francis was right when he stated, ""They were killed by their attackers but also by the globalization of indifference.""Pressure is now mounting on the Obama administration to declare Christians as genocide victims of ISIS, an amazing thought given that there is no question but that it is underway. Just ask any Christian denomination represented there. All will speak to it. Yet this administration hasn't yet decided it is. What else might it be? More ""workplace violence""?On March 2, the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed a genocide resolution, becoming the latest body to call for a formal recognition of ISIS actions as genocide. Under the omnibus spending bill passed in December, the State Department has until March 17 to speak on a declaration of genocide. But this isn't a news story, either.If the U.S. government officially declared that genocide was taking place against these minorities, it would put further pressure on the United Nations Security Council to issue a similar declaration. That could lead to trying perpetrators in the International Criminal Court.Presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton have joined this effort, but Team Obama must need to be dragged, kicking and screaming. White House press secretary Josh Earnest sounds like a defense lawyer when asked. ""My understanding is that the use of that word involves a very specific legal determination that has, at this point, not been reached,"" he explained. Two days earlier, testifying before the House, Secretary of State John Kerry also insisted ""additional evaluation"" would be needed before calling ISIS persecution a ""genocide.""In 2014, Kerry said, ""ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, including Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide."" Somehow, against all the evidence, Kerry is backsliding.Last November, the glossy magazine of ISIS bluntly announced that its ""takfir"" against unbelievers would continue. ""It will continue to wage war against the apostates until they repent from apostasy."" They declare war against the pagans, against the Jews and against the Christians. The goal is plain: Everyone will be Muslim, and the apostates will be slaughtered.How can it be that our media are so quick to condemn America's pluralism and freedom of religion as shamefully inadequate, while they hold ISIS and other Muslim persecutors to no standard at all?

1096,L,"Agatha Christie had a most unusual childhood for a top author. Her eccentric and superstitious mother was convinced that formal education would harm her mind before she was 8, and she wasn’t allowed to go to school and wasn’t taught to read.So Agatha taught herself with the help of a nurse and by looking at books that had been read aloud to her. Her mother relented, and the girl developed a passion for books.That set her on the path to become the best-selling fiction writer of all time, with 2 billion copies sold of her 66 crime mystery novels and 14 volumes of short stories. She is also the most translated author, with her books published in 103 languages (more than Shakespeare).“She became the iconic author of detective stories not just by creating convoluted plots that led to unexpected and delicious endings,” Andrew Neiderman, the author of 115 novels under his own name and as V. C. Andrews (the next is “The Incident” in July), told IBD. “She never lost sight of the need to develop complex characters that enable her stories to be so lifelike and lasting. We fall in love with Hercule Poirot, for example, even before he unravels the clues: His peculiarities and methods of detection capture our attention as much as the solution of the crime does. That’s a principle that can be applied to everything in life — build your foundation well and success will follow.”Christie (1890-1976) was born into a wealthy family in Torquay in southwest England. Her mother was from Belfast, Northern Ireland, and her father was an American stockbroker.“Agatha liked arithmetic and had a natural aptitude for music,” wrote Janet Morgan in “Agatha Christie: A Biography.” “She read voraciously, (with a library that included) compendia of general knowledge and books of lists and questions and answers, Jules Verne’s science fiction and … novels by Charles Dickens, Walter Scott, Rudyard Kipling and the Bronte sisters.”Agatha's father died when she was 11, and the next year she attended a girls’ school. From 15 to 20, she rounded out her education in Paris, returning to England in 1910 to spend time with her ill mother. They traveled to Egypt to take advantage of its warm climate, and the country would play a starring role in her fiction.She had been writing short stories for several years, coached by a family friend, the eminent novelist Eden Phillpotts, who was impressed with her initial efforts, though magazines rejected them. He recommended she broaden her reading to sophisticated French novels, like “Madame Bovary” by Gustave Flaubert.Christie became engaged to a Royal Flying Corps pilot, Archie Christie, just before World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. After serving at the front for a few months, he returned on leave, and they were married. (They would have one daughter.) She gave thousands of hours as a volunteer nurse for the wounded who were shipped back from the Continent. She also worked in a hospital pharmacy, where she learned about poison, valuable for her fiction.Christie became a fan of detective novels but wanted to make her own detective as different as possible from Sherlock Holmes or any other fictional private eye. She was inspired by Belgian refugees she knew to create Hercule Poirot, a pompous and eccentric former police officer with a big mustache and egg-shaped head, for her first book, “The Mysterious Affair at Styles.” Two publishers sent it back, but the third decided to take a chance on the unknown writer, and it was published in 1920.Poirot would appear in 33 of her novels and 54 short stories. He is the only fictional character to rate an obituary in the New York Times, appearing on its front page in 1975 after the publication of “Curtain,” in which he dies.Based in London, Poirot traveled the world to solve cases in best-sellers such as “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd” (1926), “Murder on the Orient Express” (1934), “The A.B.C. Murders” (1936) and “Death on the Nile” (1937). Actors who portrayed him in movie versions have included Orson Welles, Tony Randall, Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov and Alfred Molina.In 2013, the Crime Writers’ Association voted “Roger Ackroyd” the best whodunit ever written.Eager for a second Poirot book, the publisher was alarmed when Christie turned in a manuscript featuring two more offbeat characters, blackmailers-turned-detectives Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. But when “The Secret Adversary” was published in 1922, it did better than the first book, and they would star in three other novels and a collection of short stories.One of those books -- “N or M?” in 1941, about the hunt for a wartime spy -- resulted in Christie being investigated to determine if she had access to Britain’s secret code-breaking program. She was cleared and, in 1956, would be made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and then upgraded to Dame Commander in 1971.In 1926, Christie’s husband asked for a divorce so he could marry someone else. Four years later, she wed noted archaeologist Max Mallowan and would work with him at sites across the Middle East, influencing her stories. She also wrote several nonfiction books about her experiences.Christie introduced an amateur detective, the spinster Jane Marple, in a short story, “The Tuesday Night Club,” in 1927. Miss Marple would first appear in a novel in 1930’s “The Murder at the Vicarage” and in 10 others, including “The Mirror Crack’d From Side to Side” in 1962 and “Sleeping Murder,” published in 1976 after Christie’s death.A couple of the actresses portraying Miss Marple on the big and small screens included Helen Hayes and Angela Lansbury. In Japan, a 39-part animated TV series based on the stories and novels about Marple and Poirot was broadcast from 2004 to 2005.Christie's most popular novel, “And Then There Were None,” featured none of her favorite sleuths. Published in 1939, the tale involves eight people invited to an island, all of whom have gotten away with murder at some point. It has sold over 100 million copies, making it the No. 1 crime mystery book of all time.By the 1940s, Christie was called the Queen of Crime for her contributions to the classic story structure for the genre. Typically, a murder is committed, with multiple suspects, all of them with secrets; the detective uncovers those secrets, and an unlikely suspect ends up the murderer. Christie scribbled ideas for stories in 70 notebooks. She said characters and dialogue came to her easily, but she had difficulty with plots. She wrote with intense concentration in longhand and refused to move to safe quarters during the Nazi blitz of London in 1940 and 1941.As Christie explained in “Agatha Christie: An Autobiography,” she was so productive because “I was so frightened of interruptions, of anything breaking the flow of continuity, that after I had written the first chapter in a white heat, I proceeded to write the last chapter, because I knew so clearly where I was going that I felt I must get it down on paper.”Not content with dominating fiction, she came up with the play “The Mousetrap” in 1952. It debuted in London’s West End, where it continues to play, holding the record as the longest-running play in world history, reaching 25,000 performances in 2012. Audiences are asked not to reveal the plot twist at the end.Another highly regarded Christie play is “Witness for the Prosecution,” which premiered in 1953 and for which she earned the Mystery Writers of America’s first Grand Master Award, its highest honor.In 1971, Christie began to suffer symptoms of dementia and died five years later at 85.Her estimated net worth at the time was $600 million. She had formed Agatha Christie Ltd., which continues to control most of the worldwide rights to her books, stories and TV movies (now owned by Acorn Media U.K., part of RLJ Cos. headed by American entrepreneur Robert L. Johnson). Sold more novels than any other author.Overcame: Inability to read as a young child.Lesson: Keep delivering what your customers want.""I have given in to people on every subject under the sun, but I have never given in to anyone over what I write.""

1097,L,"New-home sales rose to an annual rate of 512,000 last month the Commerce Department said Wednesday, signaling a steady if unspectacular pace for housing activity.Economists had expected 510,000 in February. January sales were revised up to 502,000 from 494,000, but are still down 6.1% vs. a year earlier.The median sales price in February was $301,400, up 2.6% vs. a year earlier after declining in the prior two months. The number of homes for sale was the highest since October 2009, while homes underway hit the highest since the end of 2008.That suggests homebuilders are growing a little less cautious about ramping up construction.

1099,L,"The results in the Iowa caucuses are a rebuke to the notion that the national media have all the influence over America's voters.Donald Trump has been the overwhelmingly dominant figure on television news. Even his decision to duck a debate was treated as bigger news than the actual event, and he almost fell to third place in Iowa.On the Democratic side, when Hillary Clinton entered the race last April, she was presented as an unstoppable colossus, the American royal family returning to its natural place of power and adoration. Time magazine published a nauseating tribute from Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of the late Apple computer genius Steve Jobs, as ""one of America's greatest modern creations . . . she represents new realities and possibilities.""Team Clinton was left with trying to win Iowa by flipping coins, finally squeezing out a Pyrrhic victory. So much for her inevitability.It must be said that while the media have noticed the polling trend of Clinton's decline and Sanders' ascent, they are wholly unable -- or unwilling -- to focus on the desperate nature of this candidacy.Left unsaid: Her terrible numbers on being honest and trustworthy, worsened by the ongoing FBI inquiry into her private email server, are giving Democrats serious electoral indigestion.Also left unsaid: Trump's undaunted rebuke of her husband's record of crudely exploiting women (dismissed by reporters as ""alleged misbehavior"") may have made a mark among young voters who missed the scandals the first time around.Try as they do to project the power and impact of Bill Clinton's presence, as they've done for years, he has become notorious for not electing candidates. And now the public sees him at her side and remembers.When Hillary Clinton first campaigned, the media made fools of themselves gushing over the fascinating novelty of Clinton buying a burrito at Chipotle and running after her ""Scooby van"" like a flock of Grateful Dead groupies.Journalists have a very overwrought impression of Clinton's experience in office. Last April, Bloomberg TV's John Heilemann saw a terrible mismatch for Republicans. ""It's going to be hard for any of these people . . . to come up and be at the same threshold (on foreign policy) as Hillary Clinton, given her huge resume at least in this area, whatever you think about the policies.""""Morning Joe"" sidekick Mika Brzezinski sneered the Republicans were toddlers compared to their heroine. ""This is not even a conversation. She eats him for lunch . . . Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio. There is no comparison. Maybe this is my ideology, but I'm sorry -- that's a little boy, and that's an experienced, accomplished woman.""""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd even suggested to Hugh Hewitt that it was futile for Republicans to bother opposing the Clintons. ""You know, I look at sort of an obsession on the right of beating Obama and beating Clinton, Bill Clinton, over the years, and I think, they're zero for four. Is there a point where you do this too much?""Now, as reporters describe a Clinton ""meltdown"" over the collapse of her polling advantage, all of their predictions about the coming cakewalk look just plain silly.Almost none of this descent has to do with the media's coverage of her dishonesty and her scandals. The networks have labored to cover almost anything else. And even when forced to notice it, they have dismissed it with Clinton's right-wing-conspiracy sound bites.Hillary Clinton is not an inevitable winner in this campaign -- not in the primaries and certainly not in the general election. America's ""royal family"" has no guarantee of returning to the White House. That's in part because the long-standing conservative critique of the Clintons still has more influence over the American people than it will ever have in the blindfolded liberal media.Bozell is president of the Media Research Center.Graham is the center’s director of media analysis and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

1100,L,"The one-fifth of U.S. mobile phone users that buy prepaid wireless services stand to get much better data deals as AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS), and Sprint slug it out.“The prepaid market is heating up with surprising deals,” said Roger Entner, chief analyst at consulting firm Recon Analytics.So-called postpaid wireless subscribers historically got the most bang for their money. Postpaid subscribers had two-year service contracts and were billed monthly. Service contracts have been phased out recently along with retail subsidies for Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones. Most postpaid subscribers now buy phones in monthly installment plans.Prepaid customers, who typically bought less pricey phones upfront, generally were provided slower data services. But that’s changing.“Prepaid users are getting more 4G data at cheaper rates than ever,” Entner said. “When you look at the fighter brands (Cricket and MetroPCS, the most aggressive), you see the old days of prepaid being more expensive (per megabyte) than postpaid are gone.”Entner says MetroPCS customers get unlimited voice calls, texting and 3 gigabytes of 4G data for $40. A similar deal at Cricket provides 2.5GB of data. T-Mobile sells prepaid services under the MetroPCS brand, while AT&T has Cricket.AT&T acquired Leap Wireless and its Cricket brand for $1.2 billion in March 2014. Since then, AT&T has stepped up Cricket advertising while opening more retail stores. AT&T has expanded Cricket’s marketing reach through deals with Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and GameStop (GME).T-Mobile acquired prepaid specialist MetroPCS in 2013 and has kept the brand alive.Both T-Mobile and AT&T, by coincidence, said they added 469,000 prepaid subscribers in the December quarter, while Verizon Communications (VZ) shed 157,000 and Sprint (S) lost 491,000. Some of Sprint’s prepaid subscribers upgraded to postpaid plans.On T-Mobile’s Q4  earnings conference call Feb. 10, CEO John Legere said that he expects the prepaid battle to heat up.“We’re killing it in prepaid,” Legere said. “The majority of our growth is on MetroPCS, as opposed to our other brands.“Cricket has had some success, but AT&T is bleeding postpaid subscribers. We see MetroPCS’ main target not to be Cricket per se but to be Sprint. And I think you’ll see a lot more competition between MetroPCS and Sprint.” Sprint owns prepaid brands Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile.AT&T has lost postpaid phone subscribers for five quarters in a row, including 256,000 shed in Q4.Marketing lines have blurred between the prepaid and postpaid customer segments, analysts say. Many prepaid plans renew automatically every month. Phone financing plans still lock in postpaid subscribers, though it’s easier for consumers to exit deals.“We’ve seen a shift in consumers from low-end, pay-as-you-go type (prepaid) plans to higher-quality plans,” Legere said.Prepaid plans start at around  $25. America Movil’s (AMX) TracFone subsidiary, with 25.6 million U.S. customers, focuses on the lower-spending part of the prepaid market. TracFone’s growth has stalled, though.Analysts say the prepaid market could be more important strategically if the U.S. economy slows down. Most economists do not forecast a recession in 2016.Some of T-Mobile's postpaid subscriber growth has come from prepaid users converted to postpaid plans, with monthly installment plans for phone upgrades.Sprint in the second half of 2015 began adding postpaid phone subscribers for the first time in five years, including its Nextel brand. Some of Sprint's prepaid subscribers also have migrated to postpaid plans.One concern among investors, said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a 2016 outlook research report, “remains that T-Mobile and Sprint are financing low-credit-quality customers and will get hurt in any potential economic weakness.”In Q4, T-Mobile reported “bad debt expense” of $228 million, up 52% from the year-earlier period.But Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, says that worries could be overblown.“T-Mobile has never been able to fully shake the perception that its subscriber base is of lower credit quality than that of its peers,” said Moffett in a report. “Those customers would be hard hit in a recession.""The counter-argument is equally compelling. (It) holds that in a recession price sensitivity generally rises and that T-Mobile would actually benefit.""T-Mobile has gained share with its Uncarrier-branded marketing and price cutting.In November, T-Mobile launched “Binge On Demand,” which offers free video streaming.In Q4, T-Mobile added 917,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Verizon added 449,000, while Sprint added 366,000.In 2015, T-Mobile added 4.5 million postpaid subscribers, including about 1 million tablet users, and it added 1.3 million prepaid customers.AT&T lost 1.27 million postpaid phone subscribers, while gaining 1.36 million prepaid subscribers in 2015.“We expect AT&T will continue to be active with prepaid Cricket promotions while focusing on profitable, high-value customers in postpaid,” said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a report.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

1103,L,"In his classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil writes that as much as ""37% of a stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in.""IBD's Your Weekly Review, a unique screen of highly rated stocks published each Friday, is built with the fruits of that research in mind.Your Weekly Review lists up to 120 minicharts of stocks, and all of those stocks are graded in descending order by the relative strength of the industry group to which they belong.Thus, studying Your Weekly Review (starting on page A5 of Friday's print edition) enables any serious investor to isolate quickly those stocks that appear in the very top performing groups, out of the total 197 such groups that IBD identifies and ranks based on six-month price action every trading day. Use the accompanying column written by IBD's market writers and editors as a map to navigate through the list and find promising candidates to buy in a healthy market uptrend.No matter how weak or strong a stock’s industry group fares, the screen includes only stocks having EPS and Relative Strength ratings of at least 85 out of a possible 99. That's why the screen is sometimes referred to as the 85-85 Index.In a roaring bull market, you will see 120 stocks appearing week after week in Your Weekly Review, with perhaps dozens more waiting in the wings that didn't qualify only because of space limitations. Alternatively in a bear market, the list will shrink considerably.In fact, to determine the overall health of the market, make a habit of counting how many stocks appear in Your Weekly Review. During rough markets, you might notice a sharp drop in little time. For instance, in the Dec. 4, 2015, edition, the section contained four full pages' worth of minicharts and 177 stocks in the tables. By the end of January this year, the list shriveled to 56 names. Since then, the list has recovered mildly.To make the screen, all stocks must sell for at least $10 a share, trade within 15% of their 52-week highs, and show a minimum average volume of 10,000 shares a day. Investors should be wary of such thin traders. Focus on more liquid stocks with an average daily volume of about half a million. As an adjunct to the charts, the table in Your Weekly Review features the name of one A-rated mutual fund with a large position in these stocks. This supplies evidence of the I in IBD’s CAN SLIM investment acronym, which stands for institutional sponsorship.Your Weekly Review's accompanying table gives readers a sense of the market's defensive mood. Performance Food Group (PFGC), Hormel Foods (HRL) and Chesapeake Utilities (CPK) are the third highest-ranked in the Feb. 19 edition of Your Weekly Review. In other words, the market is prizing businesses in food distribution, pork supply and natural gas utility above more high-growth sectors.Dividend-rich real estate investment trusts such as CoreSite Realty (COR), Agree Realty (ADC) and Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which sport a Composite Rating of 98 or 99.

1105,L,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares rocketed late Thursday following a comfortable fourth-quarter beat and strong guidance, though recent indications point to Amazon (AMZN) gaining beauty market share.The beauty retailer's earnings climbed 25% $1.69 per share in Q4, well above forecasts for $1.54 a share and an acceleration from the previous quarter's 22% EPS growth. Revenue rose 21% to $1.27 billion, topping estimates for $1.23 billion.Same-store sales, which include online sales, grew 12.5% during the quarter.Ulta also announced a $200 million accelerated share buyback program.Shares popped 13% in late trading after logging almost 2.8% growth during the regular session. As of Thursday's close, the stock had still been trading below two key levels: its 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares now look to retake those averages.Ulta's e-commerce sales alone climbed 44.2% during the quarter. Specialty beauty-product sellers like Ulta and LVMH's (LVMUY) Sephora have been forging ahead in the online retail space as they build out market share in the real world. Unlike Sephora, Ulta also carries mass drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal in addition to prestige makeup and skincare products.Despite the crushing power that Amazon appears to wield against traditional brick-and-mortar shops, Ulta and Sephora still appear to be popular destinations for beauty shoppers.Loyalty programs, the need to try cosmetics in person, and a satisfying in-store experience have all helped Ulta and others maintain sway over consumers, analysts have previously told Investor's Business Daily.“We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated offering that propels our business to transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape,” said Ulta CEO Mary Dillon in a statement Thursday.For fiscal 2016, Ulta is targeting ""mid to high teens percentage range"" total sales growth and 18%-20% EPS growth. Wall Street sees 15% earnings and revenue growth for the year.Ulta anticipates growing online sales ""in the 40% range"" in 2016.For Q1, Ulta sees 9%-11% comp growth and EPS of $1.25-$1.30 EPS on sales of $1.016 billion-$1.033 billion. Analysts expect EPS of $1.22 on revenue of $1.012 billion.Cowen & Co. has previously pegged the beauty space as an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, whose emotional connection to shoppers offers a viable path vs. Amazon.But that path may become more difficult. A new survey from Piper Jaffray, published this week, says that Amazon gained share among respondents as a preferred beauty destination, reaching 10% after lagging behind at 3% only two years ago. Wal-Mart (WMT) remains first at 30%.

1107,L,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

1108,L,"Applied Materials (AMAT) filled a Lam Research (LRCX)-size hole in Q1 market share, but likely didn't snag a chunk of KLA-Tencor's (KLAC) customer base, Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire said Friday.The ""zero sum game"" pits Applied Materials against a Lam-KLA combination. Analysts theorize that once Lam and KLA merge -- expected later this year -- the duo could surpass Applied Materials as the No. 2 chip gear maker.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $21.5 billion market value to Applied Materials' $21.4 billion, as of Friday. ASML Holdings (ASML) leads with a $37.8 billion. Shares of all four rose Friday on Applied Materials' Q1 beat and Q2 guidance surprise late Thursday.Applied Materials stock gapped up as much as 10% In early trading on the stock market today, and was up 9%, near 19, in afternoon trading Friday. Shares of Lam and KLA were up 3.5% and 2%, respectively. ASML stock was up more than 2.5%.Collectively, IBD's 36-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment was up nearly 3% Friday afternoon.Maire sees the stock rebound as temporary. Applied Materials' Q1 was ""well short of others in the industry."" Its $2.28 billion in orders and $2.26 billion in sales for the quarter ended Jan. 31 were down 6% and 5%, respectively, from the prior quarter, the analyst notes.Silicon system orders of $1.27 billion and display orders of $183 million fell 12% and 6%, respectively, from the prior quarter. But service orders of $773 million rose 1.5% sequentially and set an all-time quarterly record.Current-quarter guidance for $2.37 billion to $2.49 billion in sales,  and 30-34 cents earnings per share ex items, easily topped analyst consensus. Maire expects chipmaking tool orders to rise 25% this quarter, but suggests that 30%-40% sequential growth would be stronger.Lam's March-quarter guidance was weak, however.""Applied Materials looks to have orders up substantially in the current quarter,"" he wrote. The guidance ""begs the question of whether there was some shift from Lam to Applied Materials in the current quarter.""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg says the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending fell 4% in 2015 vs. Applied Materials' 2% year-over-year growth in silicon systems.He models 3% silicon sales growth over 2016 vs. a 2% year-over-year increase in industry-wide WFE sales. Applied Materials, however, says equipment demand will be flat in 2016 vs. 2015.Twigg maintained his overweight rating and 20 price target on Applied Materials stock.Calendar 2016 will split between Nand (flash memory) and DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), Applied Materials said. Nand will dominate the first half of 2016, while DRAM, logic and foundry sales will pack the tail end.Service sales continue to ""rock and roll"" and will likely offset a trough in the tool business cycle, Maire wrote.But Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad sees Applied Materials' bounding on its OLED (organic light-emitting diode) investments. OLED displays don't have a backlight and thus are thinner than traditional LCDs (liquid crystal displays).Ahmad bumped his price target on Applied Materials stock to 23 from 22.50 and reiterated an outperform rating.OLED displays are being adopted into TVs, computer monitors, smartphones and hand-held game systems. Ahmad sees Applied Materials' investment in OLED technology as driving 10% year-over-year growth in 2016 display sales.Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson told analysts during the earnings conference call that the company is ""growing beyond the semiconductor.""""It is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED,"" he said. ""This plays to our strengths and significantly expands the market.""OLED expands Applied Materials' total addressable market by a factor of three vs. LCD, Dickerson said.Combined, OLED and LCD technologies put the display business on track to reach $1 billion in fiscal 2018 revenue, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a report. Mok upgraded Applied Materials stock to buy from hold and reiterated a 22 price target.

Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Wednesday. Losers outpaced winners by a 7-3 margin on the NYSE and Nasdaq.The biggest decliners included automaker, solar and biotech stocks. Oil stocks lagged, too, as West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped 1% to $37.89 a barrel.Most automakers were lower as new-car sales fell 1.5% in February vs. the same month last year. That marked the first monthly drop in six months. Volkswagen (VLKAY) fell 2%, Daimler (DDAIF) 2% and Ford Motor (F) 1%. Tesla (TSLA) skidded 3% after staging a downward reversal.In the IBD 50, LGI Homes (LGIH) fell 5% in fast volume, giving up half of  Wednesday's gain.

1110,L,"Stocks have been moving in line with the price of oil this year, and Wednesday was no different, as the major averages ended higher.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today fell 12% on the NYSE and 9% on the Nasdaq compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Investors have used oil prices as a barometer for the global economy, selling when oil prices fall and then buying when crude rises. U.S. crude prices jumped more than 4% Wednesday, rising back above $38 a barrel.As might be expected, oil stocks led the gains. Chevron (CVX) paced the Dow industrials, rising more than 4%. Outside the Dow, Tesoro (TSO), a refiner, rose more than 5%.But there were pockets of success elsewhere. LGI Homes (LGIH) popped nearly 10% in huge volume after the homebuilder posted a 121% gain in Q4 profit to 75 cents a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Sales rose 63% to $176.8 million, slightly below views.Meanwhile, biotech stocks took a hit after the government announced a test program to lower Medicare drug costs.

1111,L,"Applied Materials (AMAT) stock popped late Thursday on Q2 guidance that indicates robust semiconductor demand despite chipmakers' stumbling start to 2016 and the specter of Apple's (AAPL) waning iPhone sales.In after-hours trading Applied stock jumped more than 7%, after closing up by a fraction in regular-session trading. Shares are down 8% for the year, reflecting a 9% depression in IBD's 36-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group.For fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Applied reported $2.26 billion in sales and 26 cents earnings per share ex items. Both metrics were down 4% vs. the year-earlier quarter, but topped Wall Street expectations.The consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was expecting $2.24 billion and 25 cents -- in line with Applied's three-months-ago view for $2.16 billion to $2.3 billion and 23-27 cents.Current-quarter guidance shattered estimates. Applied guided to $2.37 billion to $2.49 billion in sales and 30-34 cents EPS ex items. The low end of both guidance measures topped Wall Street's model for $2.28 billion and 26 cents.Sales would be flat at the midpoint, and EPS minus items would soar 10% year over year.Applied's guidance speaks well for the semiconductor community, which tripped early this year on lackluster iPhone sales, fears that Moore's Law would compress growth, and macroeconomic weakness in China.IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group is down 10% thus far into 2016, matching the same plunge in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group of 41 companies.Applied trails ASML Holdings (ASML) in market cap -- $19.6 billion to $36.8 billion. Applied makes machines that manufacture semiconductors. ASML produces lithography gear, also used to make chips.

1113,L,"The so-called Texas economic miracle inspires belief or skepticism, depending on who’s singing from the hymnal.The amen corner can point to the state’s lack of an income tax. Skeptics can point to property taxes, which are higher than 33 states, according to the Tax Foundation.Stock market investors have a third take on Texas, and it might be worth more money than all the fighting over taxes combined.The Lone Star state regularly launches an abundance of initial public offerings. Sometimes that leads to breakouts and big price gains.In the past five years, 679 companies in IBD’s database launched IPOs.Texas accounted for 92 of the IPOs, or almost 14%. (Only California had more, 179 or 26% of the total.)Almost half of the Texas IPOs were in the energy sector. Oil companies are hurting big time now, but two stocks did fairly well before the sector crumbled.Sanchez Energy (SN), a December 2011 IPO, had breakouts that brought 25% and 18% gains before the stock headed down with the oil sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG), an October 2012 IPO, had post-breakout gains of 28%, 63% and 59% before turning south.Retail played a big role among Texas IPOs in the past five years. Individual investors, though, often needed well-timed entries and sell rules to take advantage.Francesca’s (FRAN), a July 2011 IPO, had a 37% gain from a March 2012 breakout, but then became a downward-sloping story.Zoe’s Kitchen (ZOES), a 2014 IPO, stirred speculation that it might become the next Chipotle (CMG). The stock formed some bases, but most led to little upside. The best gain was out of a June 2015 breakout that yielded a 30% profit.Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY), a 2014 IPO, offered its initial entry in a bounce off the 10-week line in December 2014. The stock logged an 84% gain from the 10-week line.Other retail IPOs, the debut year and their breakout gains include: Chuy’s Holdings (CHUY), 2012, 24% and 26%; and Michaels Companies (MIK), a 2014 IPO, gained 45% from a November 2014 gap up.Some Texas-based IPOs, such as La Quinta (LQ), a hotel chain that debuted on the NYSE in 2014, never found the big breakout gain. La Quinta’s breakouts led to modest gains. Others brought mostly frustration. The Container Store (TCS) debuted in 2013 amid lots of financial media attention. The stock formed a short IPO base and gained about 27% after the breakout. However, the overall trend since has been down.Sometimes a stock will stage several breakouts that go nowhere before getting it right.After its IPO in November 2013, LGI Homes (LGIH) rose and then offered breakouts (1) that led to small gains in January 2014 (not shown on chart), July 2014 and June 2015. In August 2015, a breakout (2) led to a 78% gain in four months.

1118,L,"For people with big hands -- or who claim to have them, like Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump -- Apple (AAPL) is working on a 5.8-inch smartphone. It’s “yuge,” as Trump would say.The Motley Fool and other news websites, citing a prepublication note from Taiwan-based tech publication DigiTimes, said that Apple plans to launch the 5.8-inch iPhone as early as next year, but more likely 2018.Apple currently sells iPhones in screen sizes of 4, 4.7 and 5.5 inches. The largest model is designated as Plus, with the iPhone 6S Plus being the latest handset in that class.The jumbo-screen iPhone would use an AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) display, which allows for thinner, more power-efficient displays than current LCD screens. AMOLED screens also boast more vivid colors, deeper blacks, better contrast and higher color saturation.Possible suppliers of the AMOLED screen include Samsung Display, LG Display (LPL) and Japan Display, DigiTimes said.If Apple launches the AMOLED screen smartphone in 2018, it would likely be called the iPhone 8, given the company’s naming pattern.Apple’s use of AMOLED displays would benefit Coherent (COHR), a maker of laser systems used in the manufacturing of technology including flat-panel displays, says Stifel Nicolaus analyst Patrick Newton. On Tuesday, Newton reiterated his buy rating on Coherent and raised his price target to 100 from 82 on the expected rise in demand for organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays in smartphones and other devices, Barron’s reported.Another likely beneficiary of Apple’s use of AMOLED displays would be Universal Display (OLED), which develops OLED technology.No word on what the 5.8-inch iPhone would be called. But to interest Trump -- who defended the size of his hands on the campaign trail after taking a jab on that, of all topics, from rival candidate Marco Rubio -- the new monster iPhone might have to come in gold.RELATED:Apple iPhone Demand ‘Soft’; Stock Gets Price Target CutApple Working On Dual-Camera iPhone 7 Plus Smartphone: Analyst.

1120,L,"Opinions vary about what a leader looks like in the stock market.For example, watch the financial news on TV and you’ll see a steady flow of market pundits calling Intel (INTC) a leader in the chip space, or Cisco Systems (CSCO) a leader in the networking space. Truth is, they are not true stock market leaders anymore. Yes, they have big, well-known brands -- and they’re still widely held by fund managers -- but both are struggling to hold onto market share as new names emerge.IBD’s definition of a leader -- the L in CAN SLIM -- is fairly straightforward. For starters, the stock needs to be showing relative price strength in the market -- going up in price, not down. Stocks near 52-week highs are leaders, not stocks near 52-week lows.Leaders also have outstanding earnings and sales growth and are taking market share from the competition. They’re typically newer companies, although older, large-cap names can sometimes fit the bill as long as they successfully adapt to fast-changing industry conditions.Leaders also share something else in common. Their uptrends are being fueled by institutional buying from mutual funds, banks and other institutional investors, whose buying power have the most impact on a stock’s upward move.Daily and weekly stock screens throughout IBD cast the spotlight on leading stocks. Some are large-cap, liquid names, but the majority of screens house lesser-known, yet compelling names with leadership traits. Weekly screens include Your Weekly Review in Friday's IBD. It lists top-rated stocks throughout IBD’s 197 industry group rankings. Every Tuesday, the Big Cap 20 presents large-cap names with leadership traits.Daily screens include Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, Income Investor and World Stocks.The accompanying table highlights some emerging chip designers in the fabless semiconductor space. Qualcomm (QCOM) owns the biggest market capitalization in the group at $78 billion. It is still mentioned as a leader in the group but with an IBD Composite Rating of 59, it’s not a leader anymore.Broadcom (AVGO) is the second-largest stock in the group. Its recent merger with Avago has stirred some excitement on Wall Street, fueling strong price performance in recent weeks. A Composite Rating of 97 points toward a stock with leadership traits.Meanwhile, newer names with innovative new products have emerged. They include MaxLinear (MXL), Inphi (IPHI), Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).Leadership also applies to industry groups and sectors. A stock may have the look of a leader, but if it’s not a member of a top-performing group or sector, meaningful gains could be tough to achieve.Use the industry group rankings -- found every day in the print edition's B section, on the page labeled ""What’s The Market Trend?"" -- to keep track of leading groups in the market. Gold miners have been outperforming recently.To find the leaders in the group, go to IBD Stock Checkup and enter the ticker symbol for any gold stock, and you’ll immediately see who the top-five stocks are in the group based on their Composite Rating.IBD’s stock tables, meanwhile, are all about leadership as well. The tables are arranged by sector strength to keep your attention focused on leading stocks in leading sectors.

1123,L,"United Airlines (UAL) said on Monday that it had appointed three new independent directors to its board, a day after the company said that CEO and President Oscar Munoz will return to work full-time in those positions March 14 after suffering a heart attack in October that kept him on medical leave.The new appointments and Munoz's return follow months of turbulence in the company's C-suite. They also come as United's front office tries to keep investors happy and reverse a pattern of being upstaged by rivals American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).The three new directors bring with them considerable experience in the finance, airline and tech industries.James Kennedy is a former CEO of T. Rowe Price Group; Robert Milton is a former CEO of Aviation Holdings and Air Canada; James Whitehurst is the CEO of open-source IT company RedHat (RHT). A fourth appointment should come ""in the near term,"" the company said, adding that ""certain current directors will step down"" in the process.United shares closed down 0.7% in the stock market today, although the stock still has support above its 50- and 200-day lines. Delta dipped 0.6%, and  American rose 1.2%.Munoz, who suffered the heart attack after only about a month on the job, ""has already been participating actively in all major corporate decisions,"" the company said in a statement Sunday. He had been meeting with investors as of at least February, according to a Cowen research note.Brett Hart had been serving as acting chief executive. Jeff Smisek, Munoz's predecessor, stepped down last year amid a U.S. investigation into potential improper favor exchanges between United and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.United last month said that it had expected to accelerate its share repurchase program in the first quarter, a day after Delta announced a similar move. United also recently changed its board-nomination process to give some shareholders more power to nominate board members -- something that only board members had the authority to do in the past, according to Wolfe Research.""We are always looking at ways to enhance corporate governance at United,"" Henry L. Meyer, non-executive chairman, said in a statement Monday. ""For some time, the board has been evaluating potential director candidates with the assistance of a leading search firm and with the benefit of shareholder input.""""It is obvious there is a newfound sense of urgency at UAL, which we could clearly see when we went out there two weeks ago with investors,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last month.""CEO Oscar Munoz was fired up about making changes not only by bringing in fresh blood but creating a sense of urgency and transforming UAL into a ‘meritocracy’ where people get promoted based on merit, not familiarity.""In announcing the board changes, United also touted what it said were ""significant improvements"" in on-time performance in recent months despite harsh winter weather -- an area where it has lagged behind its other major rivals. United, like others, has also made small improvements to in-flight experience. Also like others, its profits have been greatly assisted by low oil prices.Still, labor relations remain contentious. United's mechanics rejected a proposed contract last month, although the air carrier had reached a tentative contract-extension deal with its dispatchers.

1133,L,"The Pending Home Sales Index declined 0.9% in November to the lowest level since January, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. It was the third drop in four months, as higher home prices and a limited supply of homes for sales continue to curb demand.The index rose just 2.7% vs. November 2014, the smallest yearly gain since October 2014. Modest monthly gains in the Midwest and South were offset by larger declines in the Northeast and West.The forward-looking pending home sales gauge is based on existing-home contract signings that should translate into actual closed sales in a month or two. However, existing-home sales — based on closings — may rebound in December. Existing-home sales tumbled in November, in part due to new mortgage disclosure rules pushing some closings into December.Homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), PulteGroup (PHM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) have been cautious about boosting construction despite tight supply and favorable fundamentals, such as steady job growth and pent-up demand from millennials. Single-family starts did hit an eight-year high in November. D.R. Horton rose 0.2% to 32.67 on the stock market today, close to its recent nine-year high of 33.10. Lennar advanced 0.9%.

1149,L,"A positive reaction in the stock market greeted CACI (CACI) after the company announced that it indeed had agreed to buy L-3 Communications ' (LLL) National Security Solutions for $550 million.Analysts had expected both the deal and the price. On Monday, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a research note that the deal should be ""solidly cash-flow accretive."" Reuters had reported the possible deal on Friday.In its announcement early Tuesday, government-focused tech services provider CACI International said its revenue would rise by about $1 billion a year. That's about a 30% increase from CACI's current $3.3 billion revenue run rate.CACI shares rallied near a new high Tuesday, near 103 and not far from their all-time high of 104.09 touched on Dec. 1. L-3 stock, though, fell moderately as it forecast that its overall revenue would fall by a slightly greater percentage in 2016 without National Security Solutions (NSS).In its press release, CACI called NSS ""a prime mission partner"" to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and civilian federal government, which are also among CACI's customers. CACI expects the deal to close in the March quarter.Based in Reston, Va., 17 miles from CACI's Arlington headquarters, NSS ""provides highly specialized and differentiated strategic solutions, services and products for the country's most sensitive national security agencies and DoD-critical missions,"" CACI said.NSS employs about 4,000, about 90% of whom carry security clearances.CACI said it will use term and revolving debt to finance the deal.""Even if CACI ... finances the deal with debt at a 5%-6% rate, it should be solidly cash flow-accretive,"" Cowen's von Rumohr said on Monday

1150,L,"Under Armour’s (UA) fourth-quarter same-store sales likely weren't very strong, said Morgan Stanley, partly because women may not love the brand as much as men do.Under Armour's most recently reported quarterly comps were likely flat or declined 3%, year over year, said the firm, which pointed to store-count growth outpacing direct-to-consumer growth in Q4.Shares closed down 1%, having found support at their 50-day line on Feb. 16.The company, which had 191 standalone and factory stores by the end of 2015, does not break out same-store sales for those locations. Much of its merchandise is sold through chains such as Foot Locker (FL) and Sports Authority, the latter of which just filed for bankruptcy protection.While warmer-than-expected weather, poor mall traffic and other factors could have impacted comps, analyst Jay Sole also noted a maturing brand, more women's activewear choices on the market, and the idea that some women may be put off by the brand's ""aggressive, young and fearless"" image.Plus, ""we don't think (Under Armour)'s product has been as good as it needs to be to fend off competition from Nike (NKE), Victoria's Secret, Lululemon (LULU), and others,"" he wrote, adding that women have far less brand loyalty than men. Victoria's Secret is owned by L Brands (LB).Under Armour has been making a big push for more female customers with endorsers such as dancer Misty Copeland and model Gisele Bundchen.Among other concerns highlighted in Sole's lengthy analysis are a decline in average sale prices for running footwear and the stock's high valuation.Shares of Nike fell 1%, Lululemon lost 1.6% and L Brands dipped 0.6%.Morgan Stanley's commentary comes just a day after William Blair said Under Armour lost market share with teens and young adults in 2015.Meanwhile, Adidas recently brought on former Lululemon CEO Christine Day as a strategic advisor as it looks to capture more market share among women.Adidas, once a much more dominant force in sportswear, slipped to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. in 2014 behind Under Armour. (Nike continues to sit pretty at the top of the heap.)But on Thursday, Adidas said Q4 sales grew 8% in North America -- Adidas brand sales alone grew 12% in the region -- a marked difference from the 4% North American sales decline that it logged in the year-ago Q4. Management also forecast 10%-12% in currency-neutral sales in 2016 as management sounded bullish about the brand's year ahead.It remains to be seen whether Adidas can retake its second-place spot and displace Under Armour, but activewear makers won't be able to rest in the competition for women's wallets.Speaking broadly about women's apparel in his Under Armour note, Sole said: ""Women will search each season to find the best product for them and go with it, no matter what brand it is. To have a strong and growing women's business, apparel companies have to earn it, year after year.""RELATED:Under Armour Share Loss In This Key Demographic Is ‘Disconcerting’Can Stephen Curry Be Under Armour’s Michael Jordan?Adidas Boosts Outlook, Seen Heating Up Race Vs.

That 0.5% loss was recovered from the index's 8.8% dive to a Feb. 11 low and a significant step up from January's 7.9% slide. The last monthly gain for both indexes came in November.Friday's payroll report for February is the big economic news scheduled for the week.

The South Africa-based gold miner climbed 14% last week -- its sixth advance in seven weeks after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base.Global markets traded lower, with China's mainland exchanges falling harder than most. China's central bank cut its reserve ratio requirement by another 0.5 percentage point -- its fifth cut in the past twelve months -- in a move that points to further weakening of the yuan.Selling also owed to an unwinding of stimulus bets, analysts said, along with some disappointment at the outcome of the weekend's G-20 meeting in Shanghai.

1156,L,"U.S. home prices rose 5.2% in October vs. a year earlier amid tight supply, according to the latest S&P/Case-Schiller data, which should be good news for homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH).It was the fourth straight month of acceleration and the best gain since July 2014. Homes appreciated 5.5% in 20 key cities, with 12 metro areas showing faster rises. Portland, San Francisco and Denver led with 10.9% advances.Economic conditions support housing demand, but limited inventory is what's fueling higher prices. Homebuilders have been cautious about building, with D.R. Horton among those also citing labor shortages. But single-family housing starts rose to an eight-year high in November, the Commerce Department reported this month. That should eventually bolster supply of new homes and help boost affordability for first-time buyers.D.R.

1158,L,"The prospective buyer fell and possible seller rose Monday, in the first trading morning after word spread that CACI International (CACI) may purchase the National Security Solutions unit from L-3 Communications (LLL) for about $550 million.Cowen analysts immediately tagged the prospective deal as ""neutral/positive"" for CACI investors as ""it looks like it would be cash-flow-accretive.""But early in the stock market today, CACI stock was down nearly 2% to under 100, about 4% off its recent 52-week high, while L-3 Communications stock was trading up 1% to around 125, about 6% off its high set in February.Cowen maintains a ""market perform"" rating with a 98 price target on CACI.""The Reuters story that CACI is near a deal to buy NSS for $550 million is plausible since (1) LLL indicated last week that it hopes to close a deal by year-end, (2) CACI has been the most acquisition-minded of the public defense IT service companies, and (3) it would be convenient for LLL to be able to factor (the) impact of a deal into its 2016 EPS guide at its investor day this coming Tuesday,"" Cowen analysts Cai von Rumohr wrote in a research note Monday.""A price of $550 million would work out to 8.9x estimated 2016 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $62 million. Because CACI has (a last-12-month) net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.2x at 9-30-15, purchase of NSS for $550 million would boost its net debt/EBITDA to 4.1x and might boost CACI's borrowing costs.""However, even if CACI buys NSS and finances the deal with debt at a 5%-6% rate, it should be solidly cash flow-accretive,"" the analyst wrote. ""But a possible deal's impact on EPS would depend on the size of intangibles associated with the transaction.""Executives of CACI could not be reached for comment Monday morning. An L-3 executive said the company can't comment now, but may ""at an appropriate time.""Citing sources familiar with the deal, Reuters reported Friday afternoon that negotiations were ""exclusive"" and a deal may be announced this week, ""assuming negotiations are concluded successfully.""L-3 describes its National Security Solutions as its ""cyber business ... focused on defending networks and equipment against increasingly sophisticated attacks and applying forensics to deter cyberspace breaches. We support our military and government customers with a full spectrum of information technology expertise in designing global networks, cloud security architectures and complex computing solutions.""A small-cap member of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, CACI earns a 79 Composite Rating, meaning its stock is performing better than 79% of other publicly traded issues by a variety of metrics, such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. While sales have fallen by single-digit percentages in 11 of the last 12 quarters, CACI did grow revenue 1% year over year to $822.4 million in the last quarter, with earnings up 2% to $1.84 minus items. In the current quarter ending this month, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS to rise 14% from a year ago to $1.15.L-3 earnings have been choppy, falling in six of the last 12 quarters and rising 15% in the last one.

A quarter of the group's members have Composite Ratings above 90, indicating that they're outperforming 90% of all stocks in five IBD metrics, such as sales and earnings growth.Milpitas, Calif.-based KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Brookfield, Conn.-based Photronics (PLAB) lead the industry with Composite ratings of 97, just below the best-possible 99.Photronics, which makes photomasks used in semiconductor, microelectronics and flat-panel display manufacturing, has seen a revival in profit growth after a string of declines.  Earnings in the latest quarter jumped 257% to 25 cents a share, the third straight quarter of triple-digit increases. Revenue rose 14% to $142 million.The stock is getting support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with a buy point at 13.05. Its relative strength line is hitting new highs, which is bullish, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares. However, it has a daily average turnover of less than $20 million, making it somewhat thinly traded.The company has benefited from new products and the proliferation of mobile devices. However, Photronics is expected to lose some business after its  joint venture with Micron Technologies (MU) expires in May, according to a recent New America column.Nevertheless, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, in a Dec. 21 research note, said it expects Photronics to have more than $200 million in excess cash when the Micron tie-up ends, giving the company ""unprecedented flexibility to pursue strategic alternatives,"" such as a small acquisition or expansion into China.Meanwhile, KLA-Tencor has reported three straight quarters of accelerating profit growth after a series of declines. On Thursday,  the company said profit for the fiscal second quarter that ended in December jumped 53% to $1.04 a share, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. Revenue rose 5% to $710 million.In October, Lam Research (LRCX), another industry leader, said it would buy KLA-Tencor for more than $10 billion. The combined company will have a 42% share of the wafer fabrication equipment market. The acquisition is expected to close by midyear.

1161,L,"Retailers likely saw sluggish January sales gains as consumers took a breather after the holidays, and as abnormally warm weather in recent months left shelves bulging with cold-weather apparel.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting sales at stores open at least a year to increase 0.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Perkins said inventories appeared to be ""elevated a bit"" in January due to unseasonably warm weather throughout November and December. Traffic and conversion from storage to sales ""decelerated"" from December, which is a typical trend following the holiday selling season, he added.Considered the final month of the retail calendar, January is primarily a transitional period, Perkins noted in his report. Most retailers mark down holiday and winter merchandise to make room for early spring products in early February.""January is the least important month of the (retail) calendar fourth quarter for virtually all retailers, and (I) would not read too much into January results,"" Perkins said.Still, overall top-line growth has been tough to come by for many retailers, noted Perkins. L Brands (LB) and Costco Wholesale (COST) -- for its core U.S. comps -- are the only retailers in Perkins' index of monthly forecasts to generate January same-store sales growth greater than 2%, he added.Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers continue to gain share from traditional mall-based chains.""While Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings and sales results disappointed investors, the leading online retailer still managed to generate 22% revenue growth, a good chunk of which is coming out of mall-based and big-box retailers,"" Perkins said. ""Fierce competition from fast fashion, off-price, discount and e-commerce is putting added pressure on revenue and earnings growth.""Analysts expect fourth-quarter same-store sales for the retail industry to rise a sluggish 0.9%, Perkins said. They estimate fourth-quarter retail industry earnings will decline 1.5% from a year earlier, he added, noting that this would be the first quarterly retail earnings decline since the first quarter of 2014.""Flat"" consumer spending in December and continued ""heavy discounting"" and promotions -- which decreases the dollar value of sales -- are among the factors impacting January same-store sales, Perkins said. And strong auto sales are likely ""crowding out"" spending at traditional retailers.Perkins said monthly reports in the Retail Metrics index have surprised on the upside in three of the last four months. But given the ""sizable miss"" posted by Rite Aid (RAD), it may be more difficult to beat expectations once again, he said. Rite Aid reported  a 1.4% decline in January same-store sales on Jan. 28, missing views for a 0.2% gain.Warehouse club giant Costco is expected to show a 0.7% increase in January same-store sales. Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, which exclude the impact of gas and foreign-exchange volatility, are seen growing a healthy 3.6%.Elsewhere, L Brands, Victoria Secret's parent and typically a strong retail performer, is expected to see a 2.5% gain in January same-store sales.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is seen showing a 3.9% decline in January same-store sales when it reports on Monday.Also, PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is forecast to show a 1% increase in January comps.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is expected to show a 1.7% increase in January same-store sales.And teen retailer Buckle (BKE) is forecast to see a 4.4% decline in January comps.

1162,L,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

1164,L,"Barack Obama wanted 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday night, the most heavily watched night of the week, to speak to the nation about the San Bernardino shooting.It was appropriate for the president to request it, and for the networks to grant it, but everyone knew he would say nothing new of substance. On the matter of Islamic terrorism, he never does. And he didn't. And in so not doing, he wowed the press again.The stenographers underlined his good intentions. On ABC, Clinton-donating George Stephanopoulos summarized: ""A stern and direct President Obama, laying out what he called a strong and smart strategy to deal with the terrorist threat that has evolved here in the United States.""On PBS, anchor Judy Woodruff said, ""I was struck when the president said we will destroy the Islamic State. He said we will prevail by being strong and smart.""No one in these slavish studios would dare to suggest that events from Paris to San Bernardino had exposed Obama as hapless and weak. Or that more speeches weren't going to fix it, especially when he offers no new initiative to change a failed policy.Go back about eight years, when President Bush asked for a primetime address on Sept. 13, 2007, to address the status of the surge of troops in Iraq.Here's what NBC morning host Meredith Vieira asked future Obama defense secretary Chuck Hagel, then a Republican of sorts: ""Senator, good morning to you. Let me ask you right out of the bat — when the president speaks about Iraq tonight, do you believe that he will have any credibility?""That was mild for its time. MSNBC's top ""talent"" Keith Olbermann at that point was suggesting Bush was either a ""pathological presidential liar"" or an ""idiot-in-chief.""After Bush's 2007 address, there came a five-minute Democrat response from Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Did anyone at the networks line up a Republican response to Obama for Sunday night? No one even considered it, apparently — despite the fact that Obama predictably went political and blamed the GOP majority in Congress for failing to pass enough gun control.President Obama is also losing on his proposal to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. In his speech, he declared ""it is the responsibility of all Americans — of every faith — to reject discrimination. It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country.""Couldn't anyone in the press find the irony here? Under President Obama, the State Department reports that out of 2,184 Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. since the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, only 53 (2.4%) have been Christians, while 2,098 (or 96%) have been Muslims.Since the Paris terror attacks on Nov. 13, the State Department has admitted 237 Syrian refugees — 236 Sunni Muslims and one Christian (0.4%).The latest Investor's Business Daily/TIPP poll showed that 60% of the country believes allowing Syrian refugees into America is a threat to our national security. By 56% to 39%, they oppose admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees, and 56% are not confident in the U.S. government's vetting process.The Obama administration is dreadfully incompetent, and this president is seriously out of touch. The networks have some propaganda to make, so they're airing stories of sympathetic Syrian refugees now living in America and proclaiming how much they love it — take that, you racist, Islamophobic Republicans who would dare to put the flow of these patriotic refugees on hold! Bozell is president of the Media Research Center. Graham is the center's director of media analysis and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

But in the stock market today, America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, was up almost 5%.Meanwhile, AT&T (T) has acquired Mexico's No. 3 wireless firm Iusacell, as well as Nextel Mexico, over the past 18 months and has been upgrading its wireless network in the country. AT&T’s next step could be rebranding wireless services in Mexico, says Michel Morin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.“The launch and rebranding of AT&T, likely in the second half of 2016, may intensify revenue and margin pressures in Mexico, America Movil’s most important market,” wrote Morin in a report.Still, Morin upgraded America Movil’s stock to overweight from neutral.“America Movil is broadly diversified by business and region, free cash flow is proving resilient, and we expect the shares to prove defensive amidst increased macro uncertainty. The shares look attractively valued, even (with) our below-consensus estimates.”Morin says America Movil could increase its share repurchases.America Movil is one of Latin America’s two biggest wireless phone companies and competes with Spain-based Telefonica (TEF) in most countries.

1183,L,"Global Jihad: When President Obama meets with Turkey's Islamist president Tuesday to ask why he downed a Russian jet flying an anti-terror mission, he shouldn't stop there. His trust is in question on other fronts, too.Obama must also ask his so-called ""strong partner,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan, about credible reports that his government is actually collaborating with the Islamic State in neighboring Syria.Turkey is a member of NATO and is supposed to be our ally in the fight against the ISIS. But according to a bombshell new research paper, the Muslim nation is:• Sending the terrorist group military equipment;• Training ISIS fighters;• Treating injured jihadists at Turkish hospitals;• Purchasing ISIS oil;• Sending Turkish soldiers to fight alongside ISIS.Is this why a stadium full of Turkish soccer fans booed the Paris victims of ISIS terrorists, then cheered the massacre, echoing the terrorists' cries of ""Allahu Akbar!""A new study by Columbia University professor David L. Phillips has found corroborating evidence to support all of these alarming charges against Erdogan and his Muslim Brotherhood regime.Among other things, his team of researchers found that trucks full of shoulder-fired rockets and other munitions bound for ISIS fighters in Syria were loaded at the Esenboga Airport in Ankara.Also, Turkey has been helping foreign fighters travel across its southern border with Syria, known as the ""Gateway to Jihad."" Indeed, the FBI says Turkey is the main transit point for Syria-bound foreign fighters from America.What's more, Turkish military intelligence reportedly is passing satellite imagery and other data to ISIS, while helping train its fighters at jihadist camps inside Istanbul. Egyptian and Jordanian intelligence back up the allegations.Turkish military convoys have been seen carrying arms and soldiers into Syria under ISIS flags near the border crossing. The trucks display writings in Turkish (the Turkish alphabet is distinct from Arabic).Locals in Kobani, Syria, report that everything from the clothing to guns of dead ISIS fighters bear markings from Turkey.There are also several reports that top ISIS commanders have been treated at a hospital in Sanliurfa, Turkey, while the group's injured jihadist fighters have been patched up at government-controlled clinics across southeastern Turkey.After one of his jets was downed by Turkey while flying an anti-ISIS sortie near the Turkish-Syrian Border, Russian President Vladimir Putin charged Erdogan with supporting ISIS financially through oil purchases.Though Erdogan quickly dismissed the allegations as preposterous, they hold some credence. And according to the New York Times, the Obama administration appears to be aware of the oil supports.The newspaper reports that the State Department and Pentagon have had to pressure Turkey to crack down on ISIS' vast sales network for oil.And the Heritage Foundation argues that Turkey has failed to do so because it benefits from lower prices for oil. The conservative think tank also suggests Turkish government officials may be skimming money from the black market for ISIS crude, even acting as middlemen to help ISIS sell oil through Turkey.This last charge appears to be the most credible — and it is no less damning. ISIS makes tens of millions of dollars a month from the sale of oil it confiscated from its incursions in Iraq. If this funding source were cut off, ISIS would not only have a hard time running its sprawling caliphate but also projecting terrorism to Western shores such as France.It's becoming increasingly clear that Turkey is no ally but a state sponsor of ISIS terrorism. Question is, will Obama confront his friend Erdogan about his duplicity?

1209,L,"If we're counting press clips, in politics the year 2015 was dominated by Donald Trump. The liberal press is emotionally conflicted on this one.Some are delighted with the notion that he's going to destroy the Republican brand with oafish overstatements. Some are disgusted that he's still in the race despite all the negativity they've piled all over him.And now some are worried that he might even win and, in so doing, end civilization as we know it.Liberals would have you believe that they are far more nuanced and far less mean-spirited than the Trumps of the world. It's a good reason for unveiling our annual ""Worst of the Worst"" awards for the year's worst media outrages.Once again, a panel of esteemed judges in the conservative media has helped us identify the most ridiculous of the ridiculous.You decide which camp is more obnoxious.Bryant Gumbel won the ""Damn Those Conservatives"" Award for this tirade about the National Rifle Association in a Rolling Stone interview posted on Jan. 20:""There are a few things I hate more than the NRA. I mean truly. I think they're pigs. I think they don't care about human life. I think they are a curse upon the American landscape.""But it's conservatives that are the mean-spirited ones.Then there's MSNBC pundit Donny Deutsch on ""Morning Joe,"" that alleged oasis of civil chatter over coffee. Deutsch won the ""Hopeless Haters"" Award for this March 23 commentary on presidential contender Ted Cruz:""Everybody keeps saying he's a smart guy. This is a guy who basically is saying that climate change is not a fact. ... So wait, that's not smart. That's dumb. That's ignorance. ... I think he's the worst. I think he's scary. I think he's dangerous. I think he's slimy, and I think he brings no fresh ideas.""Liberals can call people pigs and scary and slimy, and that's somehow not Trump-esque.Now ask them to comment about liberal leaders, and it can get downright embarrassing. Former CBS News producer Dick Meyer won the ""Obamagasm"" Award for lecturing an ""ungrateful nation"" in a July 16 op-ed on the glories of Obama.""Americans are lucky to have Barack Obama as president, and we should wake up and appreciate it while we can. President Obama will go down in history as an extraordinary president, probably a great one. . .. It would be a morale-booster and a sign of civic maturity if more Americans appreciated what an exceptional president they have right now.""In 2015, some liberals were even praised for anything — including stooping to eat a burrito at Chipotle.The ""Pantsuit Patrol"" Award for boosting Hillary Clinton came from Bloomberg TV host Mark Halperin, gushing on the April 14 ""Morning Joe"" as Clinton opened her campaign.""The two words she needs are 'fun' and 'new.' And part of why yesterday was so successful is she looks like she's having fun and she's doing, for her, new stuff. We've never seen her get a burrito before. Fun and new.""Now they're applauding her for taking long bathroom breaks during live debates.The ""Quote of the Year"" Award went to professor Melissa Harris-Perry. When guest Alfonso Aguilar praised Paul Ryan as a ""hard worker"" on Oct. 26, the MSNBC schoolmarm took exception.""I want us to be super-careful when we use the language 'hard worker,' because I actually keep an image of folks working in cotton fields on my office wall, because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like.""Comparing the speaker of the House to antebellum slaves? She concluded:""So, I feel you that he's a hard worker, I do, but in the context of relative privilege.""After the show, Aguilar's reaction perfectly matched that of our panel of judges: ""That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard."" Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is the center's director of media analysis and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

1210,L,"Retailers the holiday shopping season on a note that was cheerier than expected Thursday as same-store sales results edged past expectations. December sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.8% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 0.5% gain.But the holiday season wasn't a slam dunk for retailers by any stretch. When the dust settles, it likely will turn out to be a mixed bag of winners and losers, while steep discounts and early-in-the-season promotions are expected to place pressure on margins, leading to forecasts for slim fourth-quarter earnings growth for retailers overall.Macy's (M) gave a glimpse into the dark side of holiday 2015 with worrisome news late Wednesday. The department store slashed fourth-quarter EPS guidance and cut its full-year forecast for 2015.Macy's said same-store sales for November and December declined 4.7% from a year earlier, and it announced job cuts and restructuring.""Macy's announcement signals caution for mid-tier department stores and much of specialty apparel retail,"" Perkins told IBD.Despite its setbacks, Macy's shares climbed 2.4% on the stock market today.Results for the 10 retailers in Perkins' index were mostly positive, despite unseasonably warm weather for much of the month, spending pattern shifts, and competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Why the beat?""Most of the retailers beat relatively low expectations,"" Perkins said. ""Consumers increased online expenditures for apparel more than expected and some retailers had better results from their online businesses. ""Giant warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale (COST) turned in a 1% rise in December same-store sales, ahead of views for a 0.8% gain. But its U.S. same-store sales rose 5%, excluding various negative impacts, short of forecasts for 5.4%, Perkins said.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) led the pack with a stunning 8% rise in December same-store sales, sailing past views that called for a 3.8% increase.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) saw a 1.8% rise in December same-store sales, the polar opposite of views predicting a 1.7% decline.Signet Jewelers (SIG) reported 4.9% rise in same-store sales for the eight weeks ended Dec. 26. Signet's shares climbed 4.7%.Conversely, footwear and apparel retailer Finish Line (FINL) posted a 5.8% decline in third-quarter same-store sales, a sales decline and earnings loss. Shares tumbled nearly 10% to 16.70.Gap (GPS) reported a 5% drop in December same-store sales after the close Thursday. Gap was expected to show a 3.9% decline.Perkins expects total sales for November and December combined to be up between 3% and 4% from a year earlier.The holiday season saw a ""shift"" in consumer purchasing in terms of how and what they purchased, Perkins adds.""A lot more spending was done online and big ticket items took a bigger share of the spending pie during the holiday season,"" he said.As for online activity, sales were brisk during the holidays. E-commerce platform provider MarketLive says there was an 8% year-over-year increase in online sales for the 2015 holiday season. Traffic increased 21% from a year ago, MarketLive said.

In July, Cisco said it's buying MaintenanceNet, a data analytics company. In June, Cisco said it would buy OpenDNS, another security-related firm.But speaking to a Nov. 11 Morgan Stanley TMT conference, Cisco Executive Chairman John Chambers said: ""Partnership will be as important over the next two decades as acquisitions were over the past two decades for us. If we do it right, our peers won't be able to keep up.""Revenue for Cisco's collaboration business, including videoconferencing, rose 17% year on year in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 24. Acano will become part of the Cisco Collaboration Technology Group led by Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager. Cisco says less than 10% of the world's conference rooms are connected with video.""As the momentum continues, there is a need to deliver solutions that will connect any system, regardless of vendor, at a scale that is dramatically higher than ever before,"" Cisco said in its press release.

The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index fell to 62 this month, but from a decade-high 65 in October.Many builders have cited difficulties in finding skilled labor and building lots for the relatively sluggish construction activity.Building permits, a gauge of future demand, rose by 4.1% after falling 4.8% in September. Single-family permits increased to the highest since December 2007, when the last recession got underway.Tight supply, along with solid job and wage growth, should support home prices. That's good news for builders' profit margins, but could be bad news for entry-level buyers. LGI Homes (LGIH) focuses on entry-level homes. D.R. Horton and Lennar are expanding in the first-time and move-up market as well.Homebuilders' stocks were little changed Wednesday morning. D.R. Horton, Lennar, and luxury builder Toll Bros. (TOL) rose fractionally. NVR Inc. (NVR) and LGI Homes fell slightly.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

1250,L,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone ""elephant in the room"" clouded Qorvo's (QRVO) otherwise upbeat analyst day, an MKM analyst wrote late Tuesday as he suggested that the chipmaker might be considering a hefty M&A play.Qorvo stock closed up 5.6% in the stock market today at 54.74.March-quarter expectations for a 10%-15% depression in iPhone sales remained unchanged, MKM analyst Ian Ing noted in a research report. Ing retired his 71 price target and buy rating on Qorvo stock.""With the iPhone 'elephant in the room,' we felt investor concerns regarding a smartphone unit slowdown remained only partially addressed and not in Qorvo's control,"" Ing wrote.Slower growth rates are still likely out of China, he added.But Qorvo's overall outlook was positive, Ing wrote. The company revised its long-term target model to 32%-35% vs. an earlier 30% target and outlined plans to recapture Samsung and MediaTek smartphone share in China.A recent $1 billion debt issuance could signal that Qorvo's Industrial and Defense Products segment is becoming acquisitive, Ing wrote. Strategic M&A could help Qorvo's IDP business grow at twice the industry's 7% growth rate.Qorvo would merely be the latest in a series of recently acquisitive chip companies. Last month, Lam Research (LRCX) agreed to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), a combination that might overtake Applied Materials' (AMAT) market share, and Western Digital (WDC) made a bid for SanDisk (SNDK).Earlier this year, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR), and Avago Technologies (AVGO) announced its plan to acquire Broadcom (BRCM).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

In 2016, 80% of spending will be focused on 3D Nand (flash memory), Dickerson told analysts Thursday. That compares with a 90% estimate at Lam Research, Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad noted in a separate report.DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) spending, on the other hand, will be ""down significantly,"" Dickerson said. DRAM bit demand is expected to be 25%-30%.Applied Materials also guided current-quarter operational expenses up to $550 million vs. $544 million in fiscal Q4. But, a decline in calendar 2016 opex could add 3 cents to EPS, Ahmad wrote.Continuing aggressive share buybacks could add 21 cents to fiscal 2016 EPS, he added. Over the course of two quarters, Applied Materials bought back $1.3 billion in shares (6% of its market cap).Sundararajan rates Applied Materials stock a hold and issued a price target of 18.

1318,L,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock gapped down Friday to a six-week low after the company gave lower-than-expected guidance late Thursday, with investors not appeased as yet with CEO Chuck Robbins' message that better days are ahead.The company's earnings and sales for its fiscal Q1, ended Oct. 24, beat Wall Street expectations, but its Q2 guidance missed.""We're doing all the right things to drive our growth,"" CEO Chuck Robbins said on the company's earnings conference call. And he said those things would be more obvious in the ""coming months.""Just maybe not this month or next. Cisco guided the current-quarter earnings at 53 to 55 cents per share minus items, on revenue rising 0% to 2%. Analysts had modeled EPS up 6%, at 56 cents, and sales up 5%, to $12.55 billion.On the other hand, more than $1 billion in annual sales should accrue starting in 2018 from Cisco's ""strategic partnership"" with Ericsson (ERIC), Robbins had assured when he and Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg announced the partnership Monday.FBR analyst Daniel Ives pointed out in a research note Friday that Cisco's Q1 security segment revenue had risen 7% despite touch comparisons with the year-earlier figure. He called that a ""bright spot.""""The company's impressive turnaround on this segment after years of pain and on the shoulders of its SourceFire acquisition (in 2013) now appears to be hitting its stride, which we loudly applaud,"" Ives said.""We continue to point to massive strength in firewall spending and next-generation cybersecurity initiatives (unified threat management, endpoint, email, database security) heading into 2016, while 'emergency security spending' has ticked down, which clearly impacts FireEye (FEYE) more than any other vendor. Cisco security share gains have subsided as the company has finally figured out the right formula/better execution and now the focus is on identifying the winners in the land grab opportunity for this $30 billion cyberpie over the next three years.""Ives said FireEye and possibly Fortinet (FTNT) could be Cisco acquisition targets in 2016 ""for Robbins as he looks to significantly expand Cisco's security footprint in this fertile market for years to come.""Similarly, Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, which offers the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) with Cisco as a top-10 holding, sees promise in Cisco's security products.""Investments in areas like cybersecurity for the firm have the potential to provide some more growth as opposed to its other, more mature business lines,"" Chanin told IBD Friday. ""It's a combination of them not just relying on their mature revenue-generating business units but expanding into those with more growth potential.""FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating on Cisco stock but lowered his price target to 32 from 35, ""driven largely by uncertainty from macro (primarily outside the U.S.) and currency.""""Although data center revenue of $850 million basically met consensus, its growth (23% year over year) continues to be strong as Cisco continues to take share in the server market,"" Syrafi wrote in a research note.Cisco stock was down 6% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 26.Among Cisco's healthiest networking rivals, Juniper Networks (JNPR) stock was down 3% Friday afternoon.

Or they end up with a series of investments that produced mediocre results overall.There's no substitute for years of live trading under different market conditions. Yet in order to improve, investors sometimes need to go back and revisit their investment education roots. One way to get better results is to reread the books where you learned about the CAN SLIM investment methodology in the first place.A future column on the topic of improving investment results will focus on attending one of the live investing workshops, which are great. IBD home study courses featuring the content of such workshops and IBD University, found online on investors.com, give a serious investor the opportunity to repeat materials any time, any place.Yet good investment books will always pose an excellent long-term method for learning, and they are cost-effective. Books allow you to learn and review principles on your own time and go about it on your own pace.Most investors should go back and revisit ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" (HTMMIS), which is the bible of CAN SLIM investing. Even if you've read the book once or twice already or are doing pretty well in the market, spend some extra time and go over it, cover to cover. You might just find some gems of Bill O'Neil's decades of market knowledge that you previously missed.If you've had poor results lately, ask yourself what exactly you're having trouble with. Is it market timing? The condition of the general market can have a big impact on whether you'll have a successful trade or not. Are you buying too late into a new confirmed uptrend? If so, go back to Chapter 9, ""M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It.""Stock selection is key to great results. Are you buying the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in a highly rated industry group? These firms crank out innovative products and services that go on to dominate their respective industries. If you are not targeting such companies, read Chapter 7, ""L = Leader or Laggard. Which Is Your Stock?""A huge part of how you do in stocks involves selling. Are you taking gains once they amount to 20% to 25% when you have them? Nailing a few 20% to 25% winners in your portfolio can make for a good year.And if you were lucky enough to catch some stocks that shoot up 50%, 75% or 100%, did you get out before they imploded after showing signs of climax action? If you're having trouble with this, revisit Chapter 11, ""When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits.""Identifying sound bases is also key. There are many charts going back more than 100 years for investors to study from.Yes, there are many pieces of the investment puzzle that investors have to put together to get the picture right.For investors that don't have the time to go through HTMMIS from cover to cover, then pick up a copy of ""The Successful Investor."" This book, penned by O'Neil in 2004 following the 2000-02 tech bear market, goes over many key topics in CAN SLIM investing. Think of the book as a lighter version of HTMMIS.

To illustrate the enormity — and modesty — of the partnership announced Nov. 9 by No. 1 networking gear maker Cisco Systems (CSCO) and No. 1 telecom gear maker Ericsson (ERIC) — they said it would hike annual sales by more than $1 billion at…
"
1404,L,"There's $14 billion up for grabs in fiscal 2016 cybersecurity spending by the sector's biggest customer — the federal government — and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), FireEye (FEYE), Fortinet (FTNT) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) are vying for their respective chunks of cash.
"
1405,L,"But some are doing better than others.
"
1406,L,"FireEye stock plunged to a record low 21.75 on Nov. 5 after reporting Q3 sales that missed Wall Street views and guiding below consensus expectations. The resulting 23% sell-off drew CyberArk stock into the fray.
"
1407,L,"CyberArk, which beat-and-raised on its Q3, dropped 4% after a stellar quarterly report that included 10 new federal customers within the executive and legislative branches. Since then, both companies have suffered continued losses on Wall Street.
"
1408,L,"Despite their opposite-ends-of-the-spectrum reports, both companies acknowledge that federal spending on cybersecurity is ramping up as headline-making breaches drive awareness across all spheres.
"
1409,L,"In the latest big case, the Justice Department announced charges Nov. 10 against three men for what it termed ""massive computer hacking crimes against U.S. financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news publishers."" The financial sector hacks involved stealing the personal information of over 100 million customers, and a maze of other cyberattacks are said to amount to one of the largest thefts of financial-related data in history.
"
1410,L,"Attacks Skyrocket
"
1411,L,"Between fiscal years 2006 and 2014, cyberattacks on federal agencies increased nearly 12 times over, from 5,503 to 67,168, according to a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
"
1412,L,"Federal spending isn't keeping up.
"
1413,L,"Between 2014 and 2016, federal cybersecurity spending grew 40% — compared with the 1,100% increase in attacks over the past eight years. The GAO report didn't provide figures for attacks occurring in individual years.
"
1414,L,"Inarguably, though, the biggest attacks occurred on the back end of that eight-year period.
"
1415,L,"In May, hackers accessed about 334,000 taxpayer accounts.
"
1416,L,"A month later, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach resulted in the release of 21.5 million employee records.
"
1417,L,"More recently, in October, the U.S. Postal Service was targeted. The scope of that hack is still under investigation.
"
1418,L,"In November, U.S. officials suggested that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was responsible for a recent surge in cyberattacks against American government employees, the Wall Street Journal reported.
"
1419,L,"The Obama Administration has been hyperfocused on cybersecurity protections, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Earlier this fall, China and the U.S. appeared poised to sign a peace treaty centered on cybersecurity.
"

"
1423,L,"So where does that leave cybersecurity companies?
"
1424,L,"Potentially with a huge sales runway, Ives says.
"
1425,L,"""There's a limited pool of companies that can handle this type of work,"" he said.
"
1426,L,"Ives sees FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, Imperva (IMPV), Fortinet, Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) taking huge chunks of the federal cybersecurity spending market. Ives estimates the market opportunity at $20 billion over the next three years.
"
1427,L,"The ""rip-and-replace"" age of legacy cybersecurity systems is still in its infancy, Ives said, and it's going to drive deal sizes to unforeseen numbers.
"
1428,L,"Perhaps the perfect cautionary tale, however, is FireEye — which recently plunged on disappointing sales and a week Q4 outlook.
"
1429,L,"FireEye was dealing with a tough comparison quarter, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the conference call. In Q3 2014, FireEye signed a five-year, eight-figure deal with a federal agency. No such deal emerged in Q3 2015. The company's average contract length slipped to 30 months from 34 months in the year-earlier quarter.
"
1430,L,"FireEye was specifically hurt by depressed European sales on the strengthened U.S. dollar.
"
1431,L,"On a nine-month basis, federal sales are great, CEO David DeWalt told analysts on the call.
"
1432,L,"""The federal sales model has been a shining star for the company,"" he said. ""(But) when you look at Q3, maybe (we're) not quite where we had hoped to be.""
"
1433,L,"FireEye representatives didn't return a request from IBD for comment by press time.
"
1434,L,"During Q3, Palo Alto Networks swiped FireEye's head of federal sales, Nick Urick. FireEye hired David Ramirez of L-3 National Security Solutions to take Urick's post.
"
1435,L,"""You can see the writing on the wall here, where Palo Alto Networks just hired away the head of FireEye's federal sales team,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski told IBD. ""They're building up their sales representatives, and we're starting to see a lot of security vendors trying to move into that space.""
"
1436,L,"Rogue Credentials
"
1437,L,"The recent onslaught of attacks buoyed other companies.
"
1438,L,"For its Q3, Israel-based CyberArk reported sales and earnings that trounced Wall Street's expectations, assisted by 10 new contracts within the federal executive and legislative branches, CEO Udi Mokady told analysts during the conference call.
"
1439,L,"The federal government's Sept. 30 fiscal year-end typically means bolstered fall-quarter sales for companies like CyberArk.
"
1440,L,"But it was the OPM breach and the government 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint initiative that really increased awareness, Mokady said. U.S. Chief Information Officer Tony Scott launched the Sprint in June, forcing federal agencies to examine and better their cybersecurity practices.
"
1441,L,"Privileged-account policies, CyberArk's specialty, was No. 3 on the list of issues that federal agencies had to address.
"
1442,L,"A privileged account has administrative access to a computer system. On average, every organization — the federal government included — has three to four times the number of privileged accounts as employees, CyberArk Chief Marketing Officer John Worrall told IBD.
"
1443,L,"To put that number in perspective, ""One bank told us they stopped counting at 1 million,"" he said.
"
1444,L,"The motivation to protect those accounts is clear. But attackers can be nimbler than the enterprises that they target.
"
1445,L,"""One of the biggest challenges organizations face is the attackers can often be more agile than the organizations,"" he said. ""(CyberArk software) adds the ability to detect anomalous behavior ... that helps level the playing field.""
"
1446,L,"From a federal government perspective, CyberArk must protect rogues from getting in and insiders from going rogue, Worrall said. He cited Edward Snowden's release of thousands of National Security Agency documents as an example of the latter.
"
1447,L,"To the former point, he said: ""Once the outsider comes in, he's going to steal the credentials of an insider, and at that point, honestly, you won't know the difference.""
"
1448,L,"Risk Aversion Runs Deep
"
1449,L,"Cybersecurity firms are hesitant to break out specific numbers.
"
1450,L,"Neither CyberArk nor Palo Alto Networks would delve deeper into the percentages of total revenue that federal sales comprise. Last month, Fortinet said that it received 12% of its Q3 sales from the government sector — but that figure includes international revenue as well.
"
1451,L,"During Symantec's Q3 earnings call this month, CEO Thomas Seifert would say only that Symantec's U.S. federal business ""did very well."" Last month, Qualys CEO Philippe Courtot told analysts that a tiny 1% of the company's sales in Q3 derived from federal contracts.
"
1452,L,"""So, as you can see, it's probably negligible,"" he said.
"
1453,L,"All taken, there's still a lot of room for growth, Palo Alto Networks' Vice President of Government Affairs and Policy Ryan Gillis told IBD.
"
1454,L,"The federal government lags the enterprise and private sectors in terms of next-generation technology adoption, he said. Procurement processes are slower, and certification processes often snag quick adoption.
"
1455,L,"Palo Alto Networks allows potential customers to trial its software, Gillis said. Between 80% and 90% of trial runners evolve into customers. But risk aversion within the government runs strong, and federal players generally spurn Palo Alto's offer.
"
1456,L,"""It's not an environment conducive to upgrading to the newest and greatest,"" he said. ""It stems from understandable places but disadvantages the network in some cases.""
"
1457,L,"That being said, the federal government realizes its precarious position as an international target, and some early adopters within the government have made mass headway into cybersecurity initiatives, Gillis said.
"
1458,L,"""The government certainly is a recipient of a range of attacks from run of the mill to very sophisticated stuff,"" he said. ""You certainly get some demanding customers in the government that recognize the nature of the threats.""

Volume was massive, but the stock was trading in the lower half of its daily range and having trouble holding the buy point. It was up 3%.Among industry groups, energy, machinery and miners were among the worst performers on the day.Department stores were the top-performing groups. Kohl's (KSS) rose 5% after a cheery earnings report. But a disappointing Macy's (M) report on Wednesday sent the whole group deeper into a correction.

1461,L,"Stocks were off their lows of the day in early afternoon trading Friday as leading financial stocks struggled to hold above buy points.The Nasdaq fell l.8% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 0.6% each. Volume was running higher than the same time Thursday on both exchanges in the stock market today.Financial stocks, especially regional banks, that broke out of bases within the past week were having trouble staying above buy points. Signature Bank (SBNY) dropped below a 154.50 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It was down 1%.Nashville, Tenn.-based Pinnacle Financial (PNFP) likewise slipped below a 55.58 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, also down less than 1%.Bank of America (BAC) slipped 1% and Citigroup (C) was down 0.4%, recovering much of an earlier loss.Despite financial sector weakness, investors are still prepared for a interest rate increase at the Fed's Dec. 16 meeting. The CME FedWatch tool calculates a 68% chance of action, based on trading in the Fed funds futures contracts.Carnage in the retail sector was Friday's big story. Nordstrom (JWN) was the disaster de jour, gapping down 15% in furious volume after reporting disappointing earnings and sales. Macy's (M) was down 2% and has lost nearly 19% this week on the heels of its own earnings disappointment.

1470,L,"In the stock market, big profits can be made if you know how to identify an industry disrupter in the early stages of its business. An industry disrupter is a company that comes to market with a new product or service that ""disrupts"" an existing market.In a 1995 essay titled ""Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave,"" Harvard professors Clayton M. Christensen, regarded as one of the world's top experts on innovation and growth, and Joseph L. Bower wrote about how IBM (IBM) dominated the mainframe computer market in its early years but got left in the dust when Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled its minicomputers.DEC, in turn, mostly missed out on the personal computer market where Apple (AAPL) and other firms became dominant.Industry disrupters aren't exactly a dime a dozen, but examples aren't hard to find.It didn't take long for Amazon.com (AMZN) to disrupt the retailing industry. For years, Amazon spent heavily to build out its infrastructure. The investment is finally making its way to the bottom line as booming online sales continue to pose a big problem for large brick-and-mortar retailers.Tesla Motors (TSLA) arguably is an industry disrupter but not because of its cars. Carmakers aren't suffering because of Tesla's luxury electric vehicles. Many have lower-priced offerings of their own. The potential disruption lies in the battery business: With its $5 billion car battery gigafactory plant in Nevada, Tesla's goal is to reduce cell costs faster and produce more lithium-ion batteries by 2020 than were produced worldwide in 2013.And let's not forget about Netflix (NFLX), whose online streaming service is causing more and more consumers to ""cut the cord"" with cable TV operators.A lot of money has already been made in all three names, but the good news is that more will hit the market in coming months and years.The IPO market is always a hotbed for industry disrupters. Read the IPO Analysis column in Tuesday and Thursday's IBD to find potential stock ideas.While industry disrupters are always innovators, innovators aren't always industry disrupters. It's an important distinction. When automobiles were first introduced in America, they were expensive luxury items that did not immediately disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles.But when the lower-priced Ford Model T came to market in the early 1900s, the car turned into a disrupter.Many top-rated companies in IBD's database are innovating with new products or services, but most fall short of ""industry disrupter"" status. That's not a bad thing, though, because many stocks with high Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings have new products or services that are fueling big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Those are catalysts for big price gains.

1471,L," The stock market closed sharply lower Thursday, erasing about two weeks' worth of gains. The Nasdaq plunged 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.4%. The Dow and S&P 500 closed below the 50-day moving averages.Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, according to unconfirmed figures.After the close, there was a bright spot as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) beat profit expectations. The retailer earned $1.11 a share, up 22%. Sales climbed 22% to $910.7 million.The company raised its forecast for the full 2015. It sees sales growth in the low 20% range, from previous guidance of a mid- to high-teens, and comparable-store sales gains of 10% to 11% from 8% to 10%. It also expects EPS growth in the low twenties vs. previous guidance of high teens. Shares rose more than 6% in extended trading.LGI Homes (LGIH), one of the winners in the IBD 50, plunged 11% in heavy volume, closing near its 50-day moving average. The homebuilder reported late Wednesday it closed on 249 homes in November 2015, up 51% from a year ago. It also announced 2,971 homes closed for the first 11 months of 2015, a 41% increase.A rise in oil prices helped the energy sector perform better than most. But it also caused truck and transportation equipment manufacturing stocks to be among the day's weakest. Apparel, biotech and some other medicals also were in the bottom rungs of the stock market today.The stock market has a major headline to watch Friday morning.

1473,L,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

1478,L,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

"
1484,L,"As recounted in ""Devotion"" by Adam Makos, Hudner couldn't pry Brown from the cockpit, so he radioed to bring an ax while he packed snow into the smoking engine to prevent fire from consuming the plane.
"
1485,L,"The helicopter team also was unable to remove Brown, who by then was unconscious. The Americans had to abandon the effort and evacuate before the Chinese arrived. The ensign was later determined by a flyover to have died; he was the Navy's first black officer killed in action in the Korean War.

1487,L,"Hudner was born in 1924 in Fall River, Mass. His family owned a chain of grocery stores, and he was expected to join the company after graduating from Harvard.
"
1488,L,"But in 1943, he was inspired by America's struggle against fascism to enter the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He graduated in 1946, a year late for World War II.
"
1489,L,"Initially, Hudner was a communications officer on ships off Taiwan and had no interest in flying.
"
1490,L,"Soon he saw the sky as a challenging frontier and qualified as a naval aviator at the base in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1949.
"
1491,L,"At 25, he was a lieutenant junior grade at Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island when he met Jesse Brown.
"
1492,L,"Brown was born in 1926 in Lux, Miss., the son of sharecroppers, and as a child worked 11 hours a day. His father had been a member of an all-black Army cavalry unit that was set to deploy when World War I ended.
"
1493,L,"In the 1940s, with Truman desegregating the military, Brown aspired to be a Navy officer. Yet remnants of black-white separation remained at Annapolis, so he spent two years at Ohio State University, where he enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1946 and graduated the next year with a degree in architectural engineering. He reported to the naval station at Glenview, Ill., and was trained at two other bases before being made an ensign and the Navy's first black aviator in April 1949.

"
1496,L,"Thanks to a vigorous U.S. and U.N. response, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Inchon landing, the communists retreated to the far north by the time Hudner and Brown arrived on the Leyte with Fighter Squadron FV-32 in October.
"
1497,L,"The two young officers bonded. On the 20 missions they flew over the next two months, they were often under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All the while, they trained in escape and evasion if shot down.
"
1498,L,"Then came the Red Chinese flood. On Nov. 17 they poured into North Korea and encircled U.N. forces. Overhead, Hudner and Brown were part of a six-plane group doing reconnaissance and attacking communist targets.
"
1499,L,"""Jesse was the section leader, and two hours into the mission around 3 p.m., we were at 700 feet when he was hit and crashed,"" said Hudner. ""I thought there was a good chance I could get Jesse out before the Chinese got there and I could pull him away from the wreckage. I did a hard landing that injured my back, and when I got out, it was freezing.

Second, integrate in your judgment all that you've learned from your instructors, officers and noncoms, commanders and comrades. Three, remember to integrate your moral judgment accumulated from life experiences, parental advice and religious instructions. Trust your better judgment, your moral code and, most of all, act.""
"
1506,L,"It was a good thing Brown wasn't captured, says Makos; 38% of the prisoners of war held by the communists died. Even the Nazis abided by the Geneva Conventions in this regard, with only 4% of American POWs dying during WWII.
"
1507,L,"The Korean War lasted 2-1/2 more years, resulting in 2.5 million civilians killed, wounded or missing. The North's military and their Chinese allies took as many as 1.5 million casualties, with 745,000 suffered by the South and U.N., including 37,000 Americans killed.
"
1508,L,"""The Korean War is called the Forgotten War because Americans like winning and this ended in a stalemate,"" said Makos. ""We forget that the Greatest Generation also fought this war, and the fact that 50 million South Koreans live in freedom today is a victory.""

His family owned a chain of grocery stores, and he was expected to join the company after graduating from Harvard.But in 1943, he was inspired by America's struggle against fascism to enter the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He graduated in 1946, a year late for World War II.Initially, Hudner was a communications officer on ships off Taiwan and had no interest in flying.Soon he saw the sky as a challenging frontier and qualified as a naval aviator at the base in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1949.At 25, he was a lieutenant junior grade at Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island when he met Jesse Brown.Brown was born in 1926 in Lux, Miss., the son of sharecroppers, and as a child worked 11 hours a day. His father had been a member of an all-black Army cavalry unit that was set to deploy when World War I ended.In the 1940s, with Truman desegregating the military, Brown aspired to be a Navy officer. Yet remnants of black-white separation remained at Annapolis, so he spent two years at Ohio State University, where he enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1946 and graduated the next year with a degree in architectural engineering. He reported to the naval station at Glenview, Ill., and was trained at two other bases before being made an ensign and the Navy's first black aviator in April 1949.Soviet boss Josef Stalin had been stoking North Korean fears that America would rearm Japan and encouraged a seizure of the South. The communist attack in June 1950 pushed South Korean forces to the bottom of the Asian peninsula.Here Came MacArthurThanks to a vigorous U.S. and U.N. response, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Inchon landing, the communists retreated to the far north by the time Hudner and Brown arrived on the Leyte with Fighter Squadron FV-32 in October.The two young officers bonded. On the 20 missions they flew over the next two months, they were often under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All the while, they trained in escape and evasion if shot down.Then came the Red Chinese flood. On Nov. 17 they poured into North Korea and encircled U.N. forces. Overhead, Hudner and Brown were part of a six-plane group doing reconnaissance and attacking communist targets.""Jesse was the section leader, and two hours into the mission around 3 p.m., we were at 700 feet when he was hit and crashed,"" said Hudner. ""I thought there was a good chance I could get Jesse out before the Chinese got there and I could pull him away from the wreckage. I did a hard landing that injured my back, and when I got out, it was freezing.""Jesse was pinned in, and the last thing he said to me was a message for his wife: 'Tell Daisy I love her.'""I wanted to go back, but it wasn't safe, and two days later our pilots confirmed that his body had been stripped and gave him a warrior's funeral by dropping napalm.""The U.N. forces escaped the trap. They suffered 17,800 casualties, but the Chinese took 50,000.Nuts To ThatCommanders issued a new order forbidding pilots from trying to rescue others. Hudner says he has no regrets and that Brown would have done the same for him.""War teaches you respect for your comrades and adversaries, and Jesse was part of my family,"" said Hudner. ""If you're going to disobey orders, first remember what they are. Second, integrate in your judgment all that you've learned from your instructors, officers and noncoms, commanders and comrades. Three, remember to integrate your moral judgment accumulated from life experiences, parental advice and religious instructions. Trust your better judgment, your moral code and, most of all, act.""It was a good thing Brown wasn't captured, says Makos; 38% of the prisoners of war held by the communists died. Even the Nazis abided by the Geneva Conventions in this regard, with only 4% of American POWs dying during WWII.The Korean War lasted 2-1/2 more years, resulting in 2.5 million civilians killed, wounded or missing. The North's military and their Chinese allies took as many as 1.5 million casualties, with 745,000 suffered by the South and U.N., including 37,000 Americans killed.""The Korean War is called the Forgotten War because Americans like winning and this ended in a stalemate,"" said Makos. ""We forget that the Greatest Generation also fought this war, and the fact that 50 million South Koreans live in freedom today is a victory.""Hudner was the first serviceman in the war to receive the Medal of Honor (145 others would, but he was the only naval aviator).American PraiseTruman, a World War I veteran, said he would value having the award more than being president.Hudner received thousands of letters from black Americans thanking him for trying to save Brown.The Leyte crew responded to Brown's death by raising money to send his daughter to college. Hudner weighed in by giving Daisy enough to earn a degree in home economics and become a teacher.After returning from the front, Hudner served as a flight instructor at Corpus Christi from 1952 to 1953. Then came a decade moving among U.S. bases as a test pilot and serving as a staff officer on carriers and in the Navy Department.He rose to captain in 1965 and was executive officer on the carrier Kitty Hawk near Vietnam.Back in its home port of San Diego, Hudner met Georgea Smith at a party. She had three children from her husband, a Navy pilot, who died in a car crash.Tom and Georgea married in 1968, and Tom III was born in 1972.The next year, Hudner retired after 30 years of service, and the family moved to Concord.He worked as a management consultant and was commissioner of Massachusetts' veterans services through most of the 1990s.In 2012, the Navy secretary announced that a guided-missile destroyer would be named the Thomas Hudner. Hudner was joining his old friend in U.S. ship history, as in 1973 he had dedicated the frigate Jesse L. Brown, which was decommissioned in 1994.In 2013, Hudner visited North Korea to try to retrieve Brown's body, one of nearly 8,000 listed as missing in action.Going The Distance""The new supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, was impressed that Tom had come so far and sent a message that the army had approval to search for the remains of MIAs, beginning with Jesse's,"" said Makos.""We were invited to return to search for the crash site with a U.S. government observer to confirm that the North Koreans did not interfere. But the secretary of state sent a letter that there would be no MIA recovery until the regime abandoned its nuclear aspirations.""Tom and Jesse were similar in that neither had to join the military. Tom could have led a comfy, silver-spoon sort of life, and Jesse wanted to serve a nation that wouldn't allow him to be served at some restaurants. They were both selfless patriots.""

1588,L,"Despite the recent recession in the West, absolute poverty is continuing to retreat in fast-growing developing countries. The escape from poverty that was once limited to the industrialized countries of the West is also happening in ""the rest.""Unfortunately, many people remain unaware of the dramatic decline in global poverty, let alone the reasons for it.According to an announcement released this week by the World Bank, ""less than 10% of the world's population will be living in extreme poverty by the end of 2015.""The bank has ""used a new income figure of $1.90 per day to define extreme poverty, up from $1.25. It forecasts that the proportion of the world's population in this category will fall from 12.8% in 2012 to 9.6%.""True, come the New Year, some 700 million human beings will still live in absolute poverty.But let us put this in proper context. Grinding poverty was the norm for most ordinary people throughout human history. As recently as 1980, the World Bank estimated that 50% of the global population lived in absolute poverty.Even in the most economically advanced parts of the world, life used to be miserable until relatively recently.At the end of the 18th century, to give one example, France had the fourth highest standard of living of any country in the world, behind the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands.Bleak ExistenceYet, 10 million of France's 23 million people relied on some sort of public or private charity to survive, and 3 million were full-time beggars.Before the industrial revolution, people on farms, including children, spent their lives engaged in back-breaking manual labor and consumed most of the calories they produced.There was little time or energy for learning and relaxation. Few people ever left their native villages and visited the nearest town. The life in the cities was not much better.Before mechanization, jobs were scarce and children were a burden. Returning to late 18th century France, of the 30,000 babies who were born in Paris in 1780, up to 8,000 were abandoned by their mothers. Many died.Thanks to the industrial revolution and global trade, economic growth in the West accelerated to historically unprecedented levels.Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, real incomes in the West increased 15-fold. A huge chasm had opened up between the West and the rest, as Princeton University Professor Angus Deaton documents in his book ""The Great Escape.""That gap is now closing.Some experts thought that poverty reduction depended on financial transfers from rich to poor countries.But, hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid accomplished little. The rise of the non-Western world has been a result of economic growth spurred by the abandonment of central-planning and integration of many non-Western countries into the global economy.Inflation-adjusted average per-capita income in China, for example, has increased 13-fold since the start of economic reforms in 1978. Following liberalization in India, real income rose three-fold.Bono Gets ItAs Deaton notes that ""the rapid growth of average incomes, particularly in China and India, and particularly after 1975, did much to reduce extreme poverty in the world. In China most of all, but also in India, the escape of hundreds of millions from traditional and long-established poverty qualifies as the greatest escape of all.""The importance of growth cannot be overstated. There is not a single example of a country emerging from widespread poverty without sustained economic growth.As University of Oxford Professor Paul Collier writes in his book ""The Bottom Billion,"" ""Growth is not a cure-all, but lack of growth is a kill-all.""Even people who were traditionally skeptical of the free markets increasingly recognize that private enterprise is the key to prosperity.As the Irish musician Bono opined during his 2013 speech at Georgetown University, ""Aid is just a stop-gap. Commerce (and) entrepreneurial capitalism takes more people out of poverty than aid. ... In dealing with poverty here and around the world, welfare and foreign aid are a Band-Aid. Free enterprise is a cure. ... Entrepreneurship is the most sure way of development.""Yet, ignorance about the real state of the world is rife. In 2013, for example, professor Hans Rosling of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden asked a representative sample of American citizens whether absolute poverty rose or fell over the last 20 years.Some 66% of respondents thought that it had almost doubled, and 29% thought that it remained more or less the same.The new poverty figures will, hopefully, fix some of those misconceptions.But as we rejoice in the knowledge that the world has never been freer from absolute poverty, let us also recognize the role of industry and trade in bringing this prosperity about. Tupy is a senior policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty & Prosperity and the editor of HumanProgress.org.

1590,L,"Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.
"
1591,L,"Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.
"
1592,L,"They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.
"
1593,L,"Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).
"
1594,L,"O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth. It extended that streak after Wednesday's close, logging a 28% year-over-year EPS gain and breezing past consensus views.
"
1595,L,"O'Reilly shares touched a new high of 263.66 on Wednesday and moved even higher after hours. AutoZone shares set their own new high Wednesday, while Advance Auto hit a new record last week.
"
1596,L,"IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group — which also includes Genuine Parts (GPC) and LKQ (LKQ), among other stocks — ranks No. 8 out of 197 industries surveyed.
"
1597,L,"Pep Boys Acquired
"
1598,L,"The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.
"
1599,L,"Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.
"
1600,L,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
1601,L,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
1602,L,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
1603,L,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
1604,L,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.
"
1605,L,"""Miles driven has been a critical growth driver — we've seen a nice uptick there,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. ""Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.""
"
1606,L,"Do-It-For-Me Fuels Retailers
"
1607,L,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.
"
1608,L,"""We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,"" Fleck said.
"
1609,L,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.
"
1610,L,"""Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,"" Faghri said.
"
1611,L,"These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers — rising vehicle sales.
"
1612,L,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.
"
1613,L,"September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.
"
1614,L,"Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.
"
1615,L,"And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.
"
1616,L,"One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.
"
1617,L,"""You've seen this boom in new-car sales, and yet the average age (of cars) has continued to tick up,"" Fleck said. ""Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there.

1630,L,"Athletes strive for a perfect score in the Olympics, as do students when taking exams. Now, should investors only buy those stocks that boast top-notch ratings? The answer is yes — and no.Yes, they should look for the highest possible ratings when considering stocks to buy. But investors shouldn't buy a stock based solely on those grades.There are many other fundamental and technical factors to consider. A stock can have perfect ratings across the board, but may not be in a proper buying area. After all, a 99 RS only means it is outperforming 99% of all other stocks.Average share volume needs to be checked. A stock may be too thinly traded.One must also ask: Do leading mutual funds own the stock? How are its industry group and the broader market faring? You can find many of these metrics on IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com.To help illustrate this point, we ran a screen for stocks based on three key IBD ratings: 99 Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength. Stocks had to be priced over $12 a share, with an average daily volume of at least 200,000 shares.Only three stocks met these five criteria today. Let's start with LGI Homes (LGIH). Leader in a leading industry group? Check. Its homebuilder group ranked No. 8 in Monday's IBD. A bonus: LGI was the No. 2 stock in the same issue's IBD 50.Mutual fund sponsorship? Six mutual funds rated A- or higher by IBD added to their LGI stake during the third quarter. Check. The overall market is back in a confirmed uptrend, so that checks out too.Is it in a proper buy zone? No, because the stock is extended from a rebound off its 50-day moving average. Its last buy point from a base was in August, when the stock cleared a 20.20 entry. It's up more than 60% from there.In LGI's Building-Residential/Commercial group, NVR Inc. (NVR) also sports a 99 Composite rank. Its RS is a respectable 91.MaxLinear (MXL) is a provider of chips for broadband communications, data center, metro and long-haul transport network applications. It's one of the leaders in the Telecom-Infrastructure group. But the group is a laggard at No. 98.Six mutual funds rated A- or better took new positions in the stock, while at least 10 others increased their exposure. But like LGI, MaxLinear is also out of buying range.It initially cleared a 13.06 buy point in early October, before gapping up to a 28% gain. It's now extended well past the entry, as well as the opening price of 14.71 on the gap up.Natural Health Trends (NHTC) rounds out the three perfect-score stocks. The network marketer of skin care products and dietary supplements leads the No. 42-ranked cosmetics/personal care group. Shares are extended from a 41.54 cup-with-handle buy point.A number of A or A- rated small-cap funds bought new positions or added increased their holdings in Q3. There are no analysts currently covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters.It's often easier to dig deeper into companies with analyst coverage, as an investor can then see how a company's quarterly results fare vs. Wall Street estimates.

1720,L,"Corruption: Hillary Clinton hopes to get her email scandal behind her by going before the Benghazi committee Thursday. Fat chance. Not only will her missing emails still dog her, but so too will an old scandal: Whitewater.Washington watchdog group Judicial Watch is suing the Obama regime to obtain a copy of a draft indictment against Hillary for her role in the Whitewater scandal, which involved the former lawyer's work on a fraudulent real estate project for a Little Rock savings and loan that cut the Clintons in on a sweetheart deal.Judicial Watch announced in a Tuesday press release that the National Archives and Records Administration has admitted locating records responsive to a Freedom of Information Act request, confirming that it found 38 pages of records in a folder entitled, ""Draft Indictment,"" and some 200 pages of responsive documents in a folder called ""Hillary Rodham Clinton/Webster L. Hubbell Draft Indictment.""However, the agency refused to turn over the files to Judicial Watch because it would ""constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.""Translation: Disclosing the indictment could further hamstring Hillary's already scandal-plagued campaign to succeed Obama as president.Written between 1996 and 1998, the draft indictments reportedly arose from an independent counsel's investigation into Clinton's involvement in the Castle Grande real estate deal involving the assets of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Clinton was alleged to have drafted an option agreement that concealed from federal bank examiners a fraudulent $300,000 cross-loan to the Castle Grande project.Her ""grand jury testimony — and her alleged concealment of her role in this fraudulent transaction, including the hiding of her Rose Law Firm billing records concerning her legal work for Madison — reportedly became the subject of an obstruction of justice and perjury investigation,"" Judicial Watch says.Hillary's law partners, Webb Hubbell and Vince Foster, printed the billing records and apparently showed them to Hillary when she was in the White House. But then they mysteriously disappeared under subpoena.Both former independent counsel Robert Fiske and deputy counsel Hickman Ewing are confirming that the indictment exists. The FBI agents who interviewed Hillary reportedly didn't believe her statements to be truthful, so prosecutors drafted an indictment.Ewing himself has said he ""had problems"" with some of her statements to investigators in April 1995. So his office drafted an indictment in September 1996. Without the Rose Law Firm billing records, however, the case against Hillary was hard to prove.Still, the fact that the Whitewater investigation resulted in indictments being drafted against the then-first lady means all those Clinton apologists in media who pooh-poohed Whitewater as ""no there there"" were, of course, dead wrong.It also means the Benghazi and email scandals aren't the only signs of corruption that the Obama regime is protecting Clinton over.President Obama himself went on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and covered for the Democratic presidential frontrunner by claiming that her unsecured private email server, which she kept in her basement and which contained top secret information, didn't pose ""a national security problem.""Of course, Obama doesn't know that. That's what FBI agents are trying to get to the bottom of by doing the forensics on Hillary's servers they've confiscated.Yet the president deliberately prejudiced their investigation.Judicial Watch says it is filing a lawsuit in U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to force the release of the indictment. Let's hope it gets a friendly judge. As first lady, Hillary was a public official, and this federal information should be made public.One way or another, the dam of Hillary scandals will break.

August same-store sales fell 1% from a year earlier.The forecast for a weak September showing suggests only a so-so finish to the back-to-school shopping season, which ran from late July to mid-September.""(Back-to-school) spending appeared uneven and skewed to necessities,"" Perkins said.Costco Wholesale (COST), which is expected to report results late Wednesday, is forecast to post a 1% decline in September same-store sales. If correct, it would be the second such drop in a row for the giant warehouse-club operator, and third in the last four months, Perkins noted. But Costco's core September U.S. same-store sales, excluding gas and foreign-exchange effects, are expected to be a much healthier 5.2% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is estimated to lead the pack with a 4.1% rise in September same-store sales.Last Thursday, drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) posted a 1.5% increase in September same-store sales, below views for a 1.9% rise.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, said early Wednesday it saw a 3.2% gain in September same-store sales, ahead of views for a 2.8% increase.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is expected to see a 1.6% decline in September same-store sales.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is forecast to show a 0.7% decline in September same-store sales.Teen apparel retailer Buckle (BKE) is expected to report the month's same-store sales slipped 2.5%.

1806,L,"Tyranny: The Castro regime showed its worst face on the arrival of Pope Francis in Cuba, hauling out its goons and showing how risky this papal visit is to the Marxist dictatorship.Some 60 dissidents were arrested and beaten across Cuba by security agents. Their crime? Wanting to attend Mass with the visiting pontiff, who had reached out to them with formal invitations.They were some of the top names among Cuba's democracy campaigners and included Marta Beatriz Roque, Jorge Luis ""Antunez"" Garcia Perez and Berta Soler of the human rights group Ladies in White. The Castro regime wasn't subtle, either, attacking and hauling off the bloodied dissidents even as the global television cameras rolled.Such a crackdown called for a far harder reaction from the Vatican, which had a right to expect basic respect for its choice of Cuban guests for Mass and other events. All the same, there was plenty in Francis' visit that could be described only as subversive, and the regime's violent reaction was proof.History shows that papal visits to such hideous regimes have resulted in their toppling within a year or so, and not just in Eastern Europe, where Pope John Paul II's 1976 visit is widely credited with injecting life into the Solidarity movement.Repressive regimes in Paraguay, Argentina and Chile fell after papal visits in the 1980s, says Vatican expert John L. Allen, who edits the Catholic website Crux. We might add Nicaragua, where John Paul lowered a finger at the Sandinista regime and blasted its repression.Francis didn't have the wherewithal to do that in Cuba. But his condemnation of ""ideology"" was significant enough. He needn't be more specific by attaching an ""ism""; Cuba has only one ideology — communism.The Pope's homily to the Cubans, on the Gospel story of how the tax collector Matthew converted from being a detested cog in the repressive state apparatus in favor of following Christ, was also subversive. It was an invitation to bureaucrats to reject Cuba's evil system in favor of something more just.Yes, the pope could have done more, and dictator Raul Castro bird-dogged him everywhere in a bid to use him to reinforce his legitimacy.But Francis did a lot on his Cuba visit to hit Castro where it hurts. Castro has survived two papal visits, but with this he may not make it three times lucky.

1817,L,"When Bill Mitchell took over General Motors' styling department in 1958, he set about removing the iconic tail fins and chrome grilles favored by his predecessor, the legendary Harley Earl.It was a bold move.Earl's designs for the 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Chevrolet Corvette, among other cars, had helped turn GM (GM) into the world's No. 1 carmaker.Mitchell (1912-88) lost little time in scrapping Earl's low, wide bodies and the rocket-inspired taillights and tail fins that harked back to World War II fighter aircraft.Instead, he used a sharp-edged, streamlined design that he called the sheer look or the tailored look.""Mitchell liked creases running fore and aft in the direction of airflow, like pressed trousers,"" Robert Cumberford, a former GM designer who is now automotive design editor at Automobile magazine, told IBD.Mitchell was behind four of the magazine's selections for the 25 most beautiful cars ever built, published in September 2006.By the time his 40-year GM career ended in 1977, Mitchell was responsible for designs that produced 72 million vehicles.Sharp Outlook""Mitchell just had an amazing sense of what would sell to the American consumer,"" said Peter De Lorenzo, a former ad executive who runs Autoextremist.com. ""He didn't base his decisions on what he thought would sell but what he thought was great.""Some of Mitchell's designs evoked images of aquatic creatures such as sharks and rays.Mitchell took the Corvette, an Earl creation, and turned it into a road rocket under names such as the Corvette Stingray, designed with Larry Shinoda; and the Mako Shark, which first appeared as a concept car in 1961 and was inspired by the fish of the same name.The 1963 Stingray, which Automobile called ""the Cindy Crawford of sports cars,"" boasted a fastback and a split rear window.""It was a compelling, evocative and emotional design"" that reflected Mitchell's love of racing, De Lorenzo said. ""To this day, the Stingray remains one of the most dramatic cars ever brought to the road.""Mitchell's 1963 Buick Riviera, designed with Ned Nickles, and 1966 Oldsmobile Tornado, with David North and Stan Wilen, also appeared in Automobile's top 25, along with icons such as the 1961 Jaguar XK-E, the 1964 Ferrari 275 GTB and the 1954 Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing.""He had few duds over his career, and he had fantastic talent that worked with him, but he was the design maestro,"" De Lorenzo said.The Riviera, a luxury coupe, was conceived when Mitchell saw the sharp-edged corners of a Rolls-Royce as it came out of the fog while he was on a trip to London, according to Automobile.The Riviera ""was far ahead of anything else on the road at the time,"" De Lorenzo said. ""It was beautifully executed on the inside and out — extremely clean, not a lot of adornment.""The Tornado, another luxury coupe, shared its underbody structure with the Riviera.But that's about where the similarities ended. The Tornado's innovations included hidden headlights, a fastback body style and flared wheel openings.It also had front-wheel drive, the first for an American car since the Cord 810 some 30 years earlier.In addition, Mitchell and his team created the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, Chevrolet Bel Air and Cadillac Seville.William L. Mitchell was born in Cleveland.He began drawing cars as a child, inspired by the Stutz and Mercer sports cars that his father, a Buick dealer, would bring home.After attending the Art Students League in New York City, Mitchell joined the Barron Collier advertising agency, where his illustrations landed on ads for MG cars.On To The Motor CityHe also became the illustrator for the Automobile Racing Club of America, founded by Barron Collier's sons.Mitchell's sketches eventually attracted the attention of Harley Earl, who hired him at GM in Detroit in 1935 at age 23.Mitchell was soon appointed chief designer at Cadillac, where his first assignment was to develop a sports sedan — the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, which would also appear in Automobile magazine's most beautiful car list.The '38 Caddy design was ""lithe, clean and elegant"" compared with the ""tall, rounded, stodgy sedans of its day,"" Automobile reported.Also, the Sixty Special was among the first to feature an integrated trunk — incorporated into the body of the vehicle — and no running boards.Mitchell has been described variously as a funny, colorful, arrogant and outspoken genius.""Few who knew Bill Mitchell are likely to forget him,"" Automotive News noted. ""His presence was at once energizing and intimidating. Not a tall man like Harley Earl, Mitchell nevertheless filled a room with an aura of command and confidence. But along with his genius came a difficult personality.""On the job, Mitchell was tough, demanding, vain and profane, ruling his fiefdom with intimidation.Loud And Clear""I liked him because he was so enthusiastic about things, but he was also crude and vulgar,"" Cumberford said. ""One day I said, 'Mr. Mitchell, I think ...'""Mistake. Mitchell cut in: ""Goddammit, kid, you're not paid to think; you're paid to design.""De Lorenzo, whose father was a GM executive, grew up down the street from Mitchell.""Bill was a mercurial guy,"" said the website publisher. ""He belonged to a local country club.

1819,L,"When considering buying a home, it pays to cover all the bases with research. One key consideration for prospective homebuyers and investors should be assessing the risk of natural disaster in the area.""In most cases learning about natural disaster risk will not stop a home sale, but it will help buyers make a better-informed decision about where to buy and also be prepared in terms of appropriate insurance coverage and family contingency plans depending on the type of natural disaster risks most affecting the home they end up purchasing,"" Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, noted in a report released Thursday on U.S. natural disaster housing risk.The report examined natural disaster risks based on an analysis of housing data and risk for hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tornados and earthquakes.RealtyTrac assigned a natural disaster risk score to 2,318 counties nationwide. Based on its score, each county was assigned to one of five risk categories for overall risk of natural disaster — very high, high, moderate, low and very low.RealtyTrac found that 35.8 million single-family homes and condos with a combined estimated market value of $6.6 trillion are in counties with high or very high natural hazard risk. Those homes represent 43% of the 83.4 million homes and condos in all counties analyzed for the report.States with the most homes in high-risk or very high-risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are California, with 8.4 million; Florida, with 6.7 million; New York with, 2.4 million; New Jersey, with 2.3 million and North Carolina, with 2.3 million.States with the highest percentage of homes in low-risk areas are North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Colorado and Maine, RealtyTrac said.Homes in the very high-risk and high-risk categories had a higher home value than those in low-risk and very low-risk areas, according to the report. Very high-risk counties had an average estimated market value of $170,237, and homes in high-risk counties had an average estimated market value of $191,244, according to the report. The average home value in very low-risk counties was $151,793, and the average home value in low-risk counties was $154,464.Home price appreciation over the past three years has been stronger in higher-risk counties for overall natural disaster, the report found. In counties with a high risk for overall natural disaster, home prices increased 16.6% between 2012 and 2015 on average, while home prices in counties with a very high risk for natural disasters increased 20.4% during the same time period. Home prices in low-risk counties increased an average of 10.1% over the past three years, and home prices in very low-risk counties increased an average of 12.8% during the same time period.But over the past 10 years, lower-priced counties saw stronger home price appreciation than higher-risk counties, the report noted. Among 551 counties, home sales prices in counties with a low risk for natural disasters increased 6.6% on average between 2005 and 2015, and home sales prices in counties with a very low risk for natural disasters rose 9.5% on average during the same time period.Conversely, home sales prices in counties with a high risk for natural disasters decreased 2.5% on average over the past 10 years, while home sales prices in counties with a very high risk for natural disasters decreased 6.4% on average.Homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) operate in both high-risk and low-risk markets for natural disasters.

1823,L,"As apartment rents keep rising, LGI Homes (LGIH) derives more marketing power to turn renters into homeowners. With six straight months of 5% or greater annualized rent growth through July, the national apartment market ""could be in its hottest long-term streak since the Great Recession,"" said market researcher Axiometrics.
"
1824,L,"July's annual rent growth rate of 5.2% was the highest in four years, Axiometrics notes.
"
1825,L,"LGI, which is based in the Woodlands, Texas, targets renters for its low-priced, entry-level homes in Texas and seven other states in the Southwest and Southeast.
"
1826,L,"It sends direct mail to renters in apartment complexes near its new-home communities, explaining how they can afford to own an LGI Home for the same amount or less than their monthly rents.
"
1827,L,"Instead of advertising the price of a home, LGI often touts homes' monthly payments of $700 to $1,000 a month.
"
1828,L,"The average price of an LGI home increased 15.8% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, still a relatively affordable $186,197.
"
1829,L,"""A big part of their strategy is building a very simple home cost effectively so they can charge a low price for it,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a housing-market research firm. ""They have standard floor plans they build over and over.""
"
1830,L,"Qualifying Folks With Less
"
1831,L,"Interested buyers are steered to sales offices in LGI communities, where numbers are crunched to determine if they qualify for a low down payment loan — typically a 3.5% product from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
"
1832,L,"Or for those who qualify, LGI offers ""no money down"" financing.
"
1833,L,"""If they qualify (for financing), LGI will literally walk them out to a finished home they can purchase,"" said Burns, who compares LGI's marketing strategy to a time-share company's. ""Most of these people don't even think they can become homeowners because they don't have a lot of savings.""
"
1834,L,"LGI may be one of the smallest of the publicly traded homebuilders among giants such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) — which also build for entry-level buyers, among others — but it is one of the fastest growing in terms of percentage gains in home closings.
"
1835,L,"In the six months ended June 30, it closed on 1,524 homes, up 32.9% from a year ago. The summer months were even stronger. In July, closings jumped 78.7%. In August they climbed just shy of 75%.
"
1836,L,"The company expects to close 3,000 to 3,300 homes in 2015, up from a previous forecast of 2,800 to 3,200 homes. It closed 2,356 homes in 2014, up 45.7%.
"
1837,L,"LGI set a new quarterly record for home closings in Q2 — up 29% from a year ago to 853 homes. Revenue jumped 49% to $158.8 million. Earnings climbed 53% to 66 cents per share.
"
1838,L,"Moreover, management raised earnings guidance for the full year to $2.15-$2.50 per share from $1.85-$2.25 previously. At the mid-point, it would represent growth of 75% over 2014.

"
1841,L,"Shares Soar Since IPO
"
1842,L,"LGI started building homes in Texas in 2003. Since it went public in November 2013, shares have appreciated about 154%. They soared 23% on Aug. 5, the day LGI reported Q2 results and raised guidance.
"
1843,L,"At quarter's end, LGI boasted 45 active communities in eight states, up from 14 communities a year earlier. Besides Texas, LGI is building in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina.
"
1844,L,"""They are in areas that are among the fastest-growing economies in the country,"" Burns said.
"
1845,L,"They are also in areas where LGI can build homes relatively cheaply compared to other regions of the country, where land is tighter and more costly. ""You're not going to find them in California or Massachusetts, for example,"" Burns said.
"
1846,L,"LGI says customers continue to flock to its communities in Houston, despite oil-related pressures on the economy there. Four of its top-five selling communities were in Houston. But they are not in the pricey areas, such as the energy corridor on the west side, where many oil executives live, Burns says.
"
1847,L,"LGI projects in Denver and Charlotte, N.C., new in the last year, were two of the firm's top performers outside of Texas.
"
1848,L,"LGI plans to sell homes soon in Seattle, which has seen a surge of young tech workers. ""But it will be in the distant areas of Seattle, not near downtown (where) the land is too expensive,"" Burns said.
"
1849,L,"LGI also plans to expand into Nashville, Jacksonville, Fla.; Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs.
"
1850,L,"""The model is very replicable,"" Burns said.
"
1851,L,"Lots Of Lots: 22,200
"
1852,L,"LGI ended the quarter with roughly 22,200 owned and controlled lots, an inventory it says represents three to five years of supply. In early July it acquired 400 lots in Denver from Jack Fisher Homes.
"
1853,L,"But since LGI is reliant on low interest rates to keep monthly payments for its target buyers affordable, how would rising interest rates impact its business? Burns says the answer is simple: ""If rates go up, they've said they will build smaller homes.""
"
1854,L,"Analysts expect LGI's revenue and earnings growth to slow next year but remain in double digits.
"

1907,L,"Battered, bruised and coveted: Energy ETFs have been gutted in the past year amid falling oil prices, but investors keep piling in. The three largest exchange traded funds holding broad-based energy stocks absorbed roughly $3 billion in new money combined in the first seven months of this year.CLS Investments, an ETF strategist firm in Nebraska, has been cautiously adding to its energy stakes.""While we believe current prices are attractive, we are inclined to maintain our current overweight, without being heavy buyers,"" said senior portfolio manager J.J. Schenkelberg.She likes Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) for their focus on fully integrated large companies, which have strong balance sheets and react more nimbly to shifting conditions.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are the top two holdings in both. FENY has almost a third of its assets in these two titans.Stewart Glickman, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, is overall negative on energy stocks.""I don't see oil prices going meaningfully higher"" for a while, he said. Oil prices hit a fresh 6-1/2-year low Monday as slowing China growth caused global panic. Plus, renewed concerns about an oil glut dog the industry.That's eroding profits for ""upstream"" exploration and production companies that get oil and gas out of the ground, as well as equipment and services companies providing the tools to get the job done.Higher RiskETFs tracking these industries have lost as much as 23% year to date. ""Industry ETFs can incur elevated risk that investors may not want,"" according to S&P Capital IQ.Still, there are pockets of opportunity for successful investing.Glickman describes ""downstream"" companies, such as refiner Valero (VLO), as benefiting from weak commodity prices. IBD 50 stock Tesoro (TSO), a Texas refiner, grew earnings 172% in the past quarter.""Crude oil prices are an input cost for them,"" Glickman said. So they are profiting from an attractive ""crack spread,"" or the difference between the price of crude oil and its refined products.A new ETF, Market Vectors Oil Refiners (CRAK), provides targeted, pure-play exposure to global oil refiners. It has a 0.59% expense ratio.Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at S&P Capital IQ, also likes Alerian MLP (AMLP).The ETF holds 23 infrastructure-related master limited partnerships, including EQT Midstream Partners (EQM). Profits for EQT and other ""midstream"" pipeline-type companies depend on the volume of oil, natural gas or electricity transported, not commodity price.Pipeline SpaceRosenbluth says ""trends are supportive"" of the pipeline space, given demand for improved energy infrastructure. Plus, he likes their income aspect.MLPs must distribute at least 90% of their profits to investors, boosting their yields.AMLP was down 15% year to date as of Friday vs. a 19% fall for XLE and 20% for FENY.ETFs based on price or earnings momentum have also held up better, relatively speaking. PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration & Production (PXE) was down 12% year to date as of Friday.""In a rapidly moving energy marketplace, a momentum strategy can have its benefits,"" Rosenbluth said. ""These alternative approach ETFs shift holdings and go where the style is working, instead of being static and fixed on the largest or smallest holdings.""PXE's No. 1 holding is Valero, with 7% of assets. Valero has an IBD Composite Rating of 87.

"
1928,L,"Builders broke ground in July on the most homes since 2007, another sign of the housing market's gathering momentum. That helped boost several homebuilder stocks to longtime highs Tuesday, even as the major market indexes retreated.Starts ran at an annual pace of 1.21 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, above forecasts and 0.2% above an upwardly revised June. Even better: Single-family starts leapt 12.8%, also to near 8-year highs.Permits, which foreshadow starts, dived 16%, led by a 60% drop in the Northeast, where a New York tax credit that expired in June had pulled activity dramatically forward in the spring months.A host of other data suggests the housing market may have finally hit its stride and may even be poised to lead the economy.""We're seeing the market successfully transition from an investor-driven recovery to one that is being driven by traditional buyers,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president for housing data firm RealtyTrac. ""That's a very good thing because it's more sustainable for the long term.""Cash Is No Longer KingSales of existing homes surged to the fastest pace since 2009 in May, helped by first-time buyers. They represented 32% of purchases in May, the most since 2012 but still solidly below the long-term average of about 40%. June existing-home data will be released Thursday.All-cash sales are also dwindling. Those sales made up 31.9% of the total in May, CoreLogic said, the lowest since July 2008. Cash sales are often considered a proxy for investor, rather than owner-occupied, purchases.Cash buyers are also frequently foreign, Blomquist said, and their presence in the market has helped push up prices. ""We're seeing those pull back and that is opening the door for the traditional buyers. But if global influences push more buyers back into U.S. real estate that could put upward pressure on prices.""As inventory of both existing and new homes remains tight, prices are likely to keep surging, challenging many traditional buyers, especially first-timers.But as the job market heats up, homeownership is starting to seem more attractive — and more feasible — even for millennials.Homebuilder Stocks RiseShares of homebuilders catering to first-time buyers have done especially well.D.R. Horton (DHI) opened an entry-level division, Express Homes, in early 2014. The firm's stock rose 1.4% to a 9-year high. LGI Homes (LGIH), also targeting the entry level market, edged higher Tuesday after hitting a record high Monday. Shares are up 40% since it reported strong earnings on Aug. 5.Lennar (LEN), which also has significant first-time buyers and multiunit construction, rose 3.1%, hitting an 8-1/2-year high.Even luxury-focused Toll Bros. (TOL) advanced, rising 2.8% to its best level in nearly 10 years.The housing market isn't too affected by China, Greece and other overseas concerns, and as those headwinds have rocked markets in recent weeks, that's reduced mortgage rates. While most analysts expect an initial Federal Reserve rate hike in September, Blomquist believes it will turn out to be a ""non-event.""All that is making homebuilders seem like a relatively safe-haven growth sector right now.IBD's Building-Residential Commercial group was rated a solid No. 34 out of 197 industries as of Monday's close, up from 98 just six weeks ago.July's hot starts pace was still about 40% lower than it was during the bubble years of 2005-06, and most analysts think that's healthy. Blomquist calls builders ""wisely cautious.""But a closely watched survey of sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders hit the highest point in a decade in its August read, out Monday.The NAHB's future sales sub-index ""has a decent track record of leading starts by about six months or so,"" ITG Chief Economist Steve Blitz wrote in a client note. ""The relationship suggests single-family starts getting up to 800,000 units (annualized) in the next several months.""Single-family homes currently account for 65% of total starts, down from 80% before the bubble. As homeownership has tumbled to a 48-year low, apartment building has surged to meet demand for rentals.Blomquist thinks it's OK if inventory stays tighter than in the past. There have been about five months' worth of homes available in 2015, compared to the long-term average of six months.Still, lean supply coupled with strong demand is pushing up prices.""The majority of markets are still affordable by historical standards,"" Blomquist said. ""The ones that are unaffordable by historical standards are the big markets with the most jobs. So it is a concern to start to see the affordability equation break down.""

Housing starts rose 10.1% vs. a year earlier to an annual rate of 1.21 million units, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, hitting the highest level since October 2007.Last month, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes in June reached the fastest pace in eight years, with the median price climbing 6.5% year over year to a record high of $236,400, above the prior peak set in July 2006.""Home prices continue to appreciate and household formation is slightly ahead of our prior plans,"" Home Depot CFO Carol Tome said in a conference call.After adjusting for data-breach expenses and the sale of its HD Supply (HDS) stake, Home Depot's Q2 earnings rose 12.5% to $1.71 per share, in line with consensus. Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 2 rose 4.3% to $24.8 billion, above views for $24.7 billion.Same-store sales increased 4.2% systemwide and 5.7% at U.S. stores.""We had a record number of transactions and the highest quarterly ticket going back to 2006,"" said CEO Craig Menear in the conference call.Interline Seen Adding BoostThough outdoor categories were pressured by weather issues in some parts of the U.S., Home Depot saw strength in maintenance and repair items, decorative lines, and professional products such as power tools and siding, among others.Meanwhile, Home Depot's pending acquisition of Interline Brands for $1.6 billion is expected to close in the third quarter. The deal will expand Home Depot's reach to professionals who repair and maintain multifamily, institutional and hospitality buildings, a change from the company's focus on products for the home.""Interline Brands can tap into an incremental consumer base that the company hadn't penetrated heavily in the past,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""It's much more of a commercial business.""

1932,L,"After his surprising departure last week from Apple (AAPL), where will former senior Apple Music exec Ian Rogers wind up? Paris, apparently. Rogers, who headed the Cupertino, Calif., company's online radio service, will become chief digital officer of LVMH (LVMUY), the parent of Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Sephora.

"
1933,L,"Markets reacted to a swell of manufacturing data out of China and Europe on Tuesday, while official export numbers out of South Korea flashed an early warning that China's woes were spreading.Korea's exports slipped 14.7%, year over year, in August. The country's exports have now declined for eight straight months, but the 14.7% decline was the trend's biggest, and it was the largest contraction in exports since August 2009. Most economists had expected less than a 6% slip, Bloomberg reported.South Korea's benchmark Kospi index slipped 1.4% on Tuesday, stemming a five-session advance and leaving the index effectively flat in a roller-coaster year. The Kospi had climbed 13% through April, then dived 16% through August 24.In the past week, even though South Korea edged into increasingly tense relations with its northern neighbor, its market acted as something of a safe haven as other Asian markets were battered, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.South Korea's economy is the world's 13th largest — a third the size of No. 3 Japan, as measured by dollar-denominated GDP.Exports are half of its GDP. China receives around 25% of those exports, making it South Korea's largest trade partner.Korea is a key supplier of raw materials and electronic components to foreign manufacturers.This position gives its data, generally reported before other countries' data, a sort of early warning role in the global trade picture.Korea's exports to China declined 8.8% in August vs. year-earlier levels.Export trade to the eurozone fell nearly 21% for the month.Petroleum and petrochemical products were key weak spots, declining 41% and 26%, respectively. Weakening oil prices accounted for part of those slips.But South Korea has struggled vs. export competitor Japan, the Economist reports, as a devaluing yen has given Tokyo the price advantage. Last month's move by China's central bank to allow the yuan to drift in a wider band vs. the dollar, leading to a rapid devaluation, also works against Chinese buying power for South Korean goods.A 15% decline in imports into South Korea in July accelerated to 18% in August.South Korean companies trading on U.S. markets generally outpaced Tuesday's losses on the Kospi. KB Financial (KB) was about 2% lower in afternoon trade.Telecom service provider KT (KT) fell almost 3%.Flat-panel leader LG Display (LPL) slipped 4%. Heavyweight steel producer Posco (PKX) also slid 4%.

1935,L,"Stocks were still in the red Monday afternoon, but worked off more of the morning's losses.The S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq lost 0.2%. Both were off by a little more than 1% at Monday's low. Volume was running sharply lower across the board in the stock market today compared to the same time Friday.In stocks, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) lost more than 6%, erasing early gains. It was up as much as 7% following weekend news of positive data on a cholesterol drug with partner Medicines Co. (MDCO) Shares of Medicines spiked up 17%.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fell 2%, putting it on pace to snap a four-day win streak. The video-game maker was added to the S&P 500 after Friday' close. Activision Blizzard has quickly rebounded after triggering a sell signal last Monday. It's now nearly 10% past a 26.19 buy point in a flat base.LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied nearly 4% after erasing early losses. Unlike many leading stocks, LGI did not trigger any sell signals during last Monday's wild ride. It's now 28% past a 20.20 buy point in a flat base. The homebuilder was recently featured in Sector Leaders Review.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) added nearly 2% to a new high. It's now 6% past a 17.04 buy point from a flat base regained Friday. Shares of the gun maker surged 11% Friday on blowout fiscal Q1 earnings.Follow Vincent Mao on Twitter: @IBD_VMao

1937,L,"The IPO Leaders screen can hold up to 16 stocks, but overall market health dictates how many names make the biweekly screen. In healthy markets, 16 is the normal number, but in unhealthy markets, the screen tends to get smaller. On Tuesday, just 10 made the cut.There's no shortage of resilient stocks in today's screen, but none is buyable now — not when the market is in a correction.Still, it makes sense to fill your watch list with strong names that have held up well during the recent market carnage. Some will be the next leaders when the market tide turns positive again.It's been a tough week so far for Inogen (INGN). It round-tripped a 13% gain from a 45.85 buy point, but it's still holding near its 10-week line and trading near the buy point.It's a small company with a market capitalization of $896 million, but mutual fund ownership of the stock has been steadily rising in recent quarters. The company's portable oxygen concentrators give greater mobility to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions.Like most other growth stocks, Paycom Software (PAYC) had been volatile for more than a week, but it's still holding near highs. On Monday, the stock crashed 16% below a 39.27 buy point, but it closed strongly, near the top of its intraday range and above its 50-day moving average. The 39.27 buy point is still in play — but again, investors should avoid new buys until a new market uptrend is confirmed.While weakness in the major averages has pressured many homebuilders (the group has lost around 10% in the past five sessions), LGI Homes (LGIH) has shown surprising resilience. Its 10-week moving average around 21 is a logical support level at this point. It basically coincides with the stock's last buy point, 20.20.After a bullish accumulation phase that saw Avolon (AVOL) rise 28% above a 24.92 buy point, the aircraft leasing firm is still holding comfortably above the buy point and its 10-week moving average. Not many growth stocks can say that these days.Follow Ken Shreve on Twitter: @IBD_KShreve

1938,L,"Some housing experts suggest that millennials may never participate to the same degree as their predecessors in the American dream of homeownership, or at least not anytime soon.
"
1939,L,"About a fifth of the more than 80 million-strong cohort, a demographic usually described as ranging in age from the late teens or early 20s to the mid-30s, still live with their parents or other older relatives.
"
1940,L,"About 50% are renters. Large numbers are considered underemployed and underpaid, and they have delayed the usual triggers for buying a home: marriage and kids.
"
1941,L,"In July, first-time buyers accounted for just 28% of existing home sales, down from an already low 30% in June, according to the National Association of Realtors.
"
1942,L,"In rosier times before the housing crisis, the historic average was a little less than 40% of the total, says Selma Hepp, chief economist with Trulia, a home-information website that is part of Zillow Group (Z). Their numbers spiked briefly in 2009, to nearly 39% of home sales. But that was due to a one-time tax credit for first-timers.
"
1943,L,"Other evidence paints a more positive picture: Most millennials say they want to eventually buy a home if they don't already own one now. The big question: when?
"
1944,L,"A survey by Trulia indicated that nine out of 10 millennials plan to buy a home, ""but not necessarily today,"" said Hepp.
"
1945,L,"In the survey, 50% of those married with kids said they plan to buy sooner than later — within the next two years. ""The ones that have gotten married and have kids are trickling in now,"" Hepp said.
"
1946,L,"""Our data and numerous data indicate they are coming back into the market and contributing a bigger share to the new-buyer market,"" she said. ""The thing is, in many markets where they would be buying, they may be constrained by affordability.""
"
1947,L,"That's especially true in markets with good job growth, such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. ""That is where you are also seeing low inventories and hence higher price appreciation,"" she said.
"
1948,L,"Besides getting priced out of hot markets, July's dip in the percentage of first-time buyers might also have to do with those buyers jumping into the housing market in the spring and early summer in anticipation of expected interest-rate increases later this year, housing watchers say.
"
1949,L,"""Monthly data is very volatile. I think it's going to continue to be a steady rate (up) for first-time buyers,"" Hepp said.
"
1950,L,"First-time buyers with little savings often turn to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which require just 3.5% down.
"
1951,L,"FHA loans' share of total home originations has been climbing this year. In July, FHA loans made up 22.8% of all home sales, up from 18.1% a year ago, according to a report out Thursday from RealtyTrac, a real estate data company.
"
1952,L,"'Boomerang' Buyers Are Back
"
1953,L,"One reason for the uptick may be tied to a cut in insurance fees on Jan. 26 — from 1.35% of the loan to 0.85% — which makes monthly payments lower. On a median-priced home nationwide, that comes to an annual savings of $917 a year, according to calculations made by RealtyTrac in January.
"
1954,L,"But cash-poor ""boomerang"" buyers returning to the homebuying market after losing their homes in foreclosures in the housing downturn also are causing the mix of FHA loans to tick up, said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.
"
1955,L,"A new mortgage-lending option announced on Tuesday by Fannie Mae will make it easier for credit-worthy first-time borrowers with lower-to-moderate incomes to access financing — with as little as 3% down.
"
1956,L,"The HomeReady mortgage will consider income from non-borrowers, such as parents, and rental income from a portion of the property, such as a room or basement.
"
1957,L,"""We noted earlier this year that first-time home buyer activity seemed to accelerate as initial down payment requirements started to ease, and this new program should enable even more borrowers to come up with the initial down payment needed to acquire a home,"" wrote analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note on Wednesday.
"
1958,L,"Are first-time buyers really coming back? ""I think they are,"" said Blomquist. ""FHA data is going up and (an FHA loan) is typically a first-time buyer.""
"
1959,L,"Any sparks that send entry-level buyers into the buying pool would be good news for homebuilders that target them, such as D.R. Horton (DHI), with its Express Homes division, and LGI Homes (LGIH), both based in Texas, among others.
"
1960,L,"Cash Buyers Retreat
"
1961,L,"Blomquist says first-time buyers also are benefiting from lower numbers of cash buyers looking to buy homes. In July, cash buyers' share fell to an eight-year low, accounting for 22.6% of home purchases, down from 23.7% in June and 26.5% in July 2014.
"
1962,L,"""Fewer cash buyers in the market opens up the market to first-time buyers,"" Blomquist said.
"
1963,L,"But first-time buyers might not have much luck in the most expensive markets, where prices are still rising amid tight supply.
"
1964,L,"Since February, one young couple in Los Angeles, professors at local colleges, lost bidding wars on 12 condos and townhomes, all priced under $800,000, before a bid on a townhome in Marina Del Rey was finally accepted a couple of weeks ago. Their offer of $740,000 was $10,000 above asking price.
"
1965,L,"""It's rare we don't have multiple offers on properties,"" said Nikki Kilmer, an agent based in West L.A. for national realty company Redfin. ""But I'm seeing less cash buyers now than in June and July. Buyers have slowed their searches down because of the competition and prices (up 5% in L.A. in July vs. a year ago). Or they are deciding to hold off and wait until the market cools down, and maybe jump in around the holidays.""
"
1966,L,"Before the recent stock-market tumble, the Federal Reserve was widely expected to raise interest rates before the end of the year. But most real estate watchers expect the increases from near-low levels to be minimal and gradual, as the Fed has said. In July, the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.05%, up from 3.98% in June, according to Freddie Mac. On Thursday it was down to 3.84%.
"
1967,L,"The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year fixed rate to edge up to 4.4% by the fourth quarter. The gradual increase in rates will likely be accompanied ""by a steady improvement in labor markets, which will help to offset the impact,"" said Lynn Fisher, a VP at the MBA, in an email to IBD. ""If anything, a slowly improving economy will provide first-time home buyers stability and the means to enter the market soon.""
"
1968,L,"Markets in the ""sweet spot"" for first-time buyers are a cross between affordability and good jobs, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.
"
1969,L,"""There are very few places that have both nowadays. South Carolina is booming and is still relatively affordable,"" she said, pointing to Charleston in particular. ""Nashville is booming, The Midwest is still affordable. The coasts, not so good.""
"
1970,L,"FHA loans may not be the best solution for all first-time buyers. ""It does come with costs,"" Richardson said. ""The annual (insurance) premium came down but not the upfront fee.""
"
1971,L,"New FHA underwriting rules that went into effect in mid-June may also make it tougher to for first-time buyers to qualify, including changes in the way deferred student loans are factored into debt-to-ratio calculations and gaps in employment.
"
1972,L,"What's more, a 3.5% down payment means higher monthly mortgage payments vs. a conventional loan, which typically requires 20% down.
"
1973,L,"""You don't need a lot of savings but you need income,"" Richardson said. ""That's the sticker. Wages are still stagnant. Incomes have not kept up with price increases.""
"
1974,L,"In a Redfin survey in July of more than 3,500 buyers, the 1,400 first-time buyers ""almost to the letter said they were concerned about the high prices and the competition,"" Richardson said.
"
1975,L,"Housing watchers are hopeful that millennials will gradually step up to the homebuying plate in larger numbers. And when they do, they'll likely have a big impact. Their sheer numbers alone are impressive — larger than the baby-boom generation.
"
1976,L,"""This is not the last hurrah,"" Blomquist said.
"
1977,L,"But their impact won't likely be felt overnight.

In his new model, he maintained his Q3 2015 EPS estimate of 34 cents a share vs. Wall Street's estimate of 35 cents. But he raised his full-year 2015 EPS estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.38.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to keep up that streak when the company reports results on Wednesday.

""It has had some exceptional growth over the last few quarters on the topline as well as on the bottom line with strong margin expansion. Going forward, even though the industry remains healthy, it's expected to see a slowdown in growth, which is expected by investors.""O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto parts industry group.

1999,L,"AT&T might set its M&A sights on Latin America, particularly Brazil, if U.S. regulators approve its acquisition of satellite-TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, analysts say.AT&T (T) has agreed to buy DirecTV (DTV) for $48.5 billion, mostly in stock, turning away from another purported object of interest, U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD), whose wireless business spans Europe, India and other emerging markets.Acquiring DirecTV would give AT&T a financial boost to fund its large dividend, analysts say, as well as boost its pay TV assets to compete with Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ). In choosing DirecTV over Vodafone, analysts say, AT&T might also have favored expanding in Latin America rather than heavily regulated Europe.Ralph de la Vega, CEO of AT&T Mobility, once ran BellSouth's Latin American wireless business. AT&T's forerunner, SBC Communications, acquired BellSouth in 2006. Analysts say that AT&T might pursue pay TV, broadband or wireless acquisitions in Latin America, depending on what opportunities arise.DirecTV has 11.9 million subscribers in Latin America, not including its 41% stake in Sky Mexico.Brazil's GVT (Global Village Telecom) and TIM Brasil, also known as TIM Participacoes (TSU), reportedly are on the market, said Kevin Smithen, a Macquarie Capital analyst, in a recent research note. ""AT&T could choose to grow its Brazilian operations by buying GVT or TIM Brasil,"" he wrote.Vivo Leads In BrazilSpain-based Telefonica (TEF) owns Vivo, Brazil's No. 1 wireless firm. TIM Participacoes, the No. 2 wireless service provider, which is controlled by Telecom Italia (TI), has been the market's fastest-growing company. Mexico's America Movil (AMX) owns No. 3 Claro. Oi, formed in the 2009 merger of Telemar Participacoes and Brasil Telecom, is No. 4.Telefonica last year upped its investment in Telecom Italia, leading to speculation that TIM Brasil could be sold or broken up, with Vivo bidding on the lion's share of assets.In Smithen's view, Brazilian regulator Anatel would welcome an AT&T purchase of TIM Brasil because the country would still have four large national players. But investors have been hoping to see consolidation in Brazil's market that would reduce the number to three amid intensifying competition.Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG Research, says that other wireless firms might move first while AT&T awaits regulatory approval for DirecTV.""Telefonica might want to consider moving forward with consolidation plans in Brazil this year that would result in the acquisition of TIM Brasil by existing players before AT&T can enter as an interloper into that market,"" Piecyk said in a blog post.""More broadly, it might also be a good time for global telecom companies like Vodafone, SoftBank and China Mobile (CHL) to re-evaluate any plans for Latin America, as strategic opportunities might start to dwindle by the end of 2015.""Another option for AT&T-DirecTV could be acquiring GVT, owned by French media company Vivendi.With 2.7 million Internet customers, GVT holds about 11% of Brazil's broadband market, behind Telefonica and America Movil. GVT has 776,400 pay TV customers, about 4% of that market.Vivendi Asking Price HighVivendi pulled GVT off the block in early 2013 after bids failed to meet its goals. DirecTV had an interest in acquiring GVT, but analysts said that Vivendi's $9 billion asking price was much too high.With AT&T's backing, DirecTV could take a fresh look at GVT.""I have no doubt that to have AT&T and their expertise, we will be able to look at M&A opportunities differently, things that we probably would've shied away from because it is not our core competence,"" DirecTV CEO Mike White said on a conference call with analysts on May 19.In Brazil and other countries, AT&T will square off vs. America Movil, a longtime ally. AT&T plans to sell its 8.4% stake in America Movil to help fund its DirecTV acquisition and ease regulatory issues in Latin America.AT&T and America Movil, which is controlled by multibillionaire Carlos Slim, jointly bid for a controlling stake in 2007 for Telecom Italia. They've had other business ties.At a JPMorgan conference on May 21, AT&T CFO John Stephens said that AT&T has the know-how to help DirecTV build out wireless broadband networks in Latin America. DirecTV has radio-spectrum licenses in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.

2048,L,"A leading stock tends to hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of at least 80 out of 99, indicating that the stock's price performance ranks it in the top 15% off all stocks over the past 52 weeks. Stocks whose shares are falling usually indicate that their fundamentals are deteriorating. The top mutual fund managers may in fact be exiting out of the stock.

2050,L,"Investing in growth stocks, no matter how good their fundamentals or chart patterns, always comes with risks. For example, when a market correction hits, leading stocks can fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the general market.
"
2051,L,"Also, after lengthy uptrends, some leaders maintain high ratings from IBD even though they're in late-stage price runs. Prefer leaders when they're breaking out of early-stage bases over those breaking out after huge price runs.The L in IBD's CAN SLIM stock investment system is a simple yet vital concept.It stands for Leaders: high-growth stocks with the greatest potential for outstanding returns.True market leaders are typically the best performers in top-tier industry groups or sectors. They boast strong profit and revenue growth, generate unique or innovative products and services, and receive solid institutional support.""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Some investing systems emphasize buying stocks that have been beaten down, implying that they're undervalued and therefore ready to rebound. But CAN SLIM investors focus on stocks that are showing strength as they break out of properly formed bases and hit new highs.If the overall stock market is trending higher , and you buy at a proper buy point, you have a strong chance of making money quickly with the top stocks. Volume as the stock breaks out of its base is key, as heavy volume indicates that the stock is being driven higher by mutual funds and other high-powered investors.Top growth stocks that seemingly came out of nowhere to break out and rack up huge gains for investors include computer networking king Cisco Systems (CSCO) in October 1990, Apple (AAPL) in March 2004 and search engine pioneer Google (GOOGL) in September 2004.

2121,L,"Dads, grads and America's 239th birthday weren't enough for June to bloom, as retailers had another so-so month with consumers finding other outlets for pocket change.The numbers indicate that consumers are shifting their spending away from traditional retail shops and in favor of shelling out for technology such as smartphones and tablets by Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other makers, as well as dining, entertainment and car purchases.June same-store sales missed forecasts, coming in down 0.2% from a year ago, after a 0.6% year-over-year gain in May and a 0.9% decline in April, according to a tally of 11 chains by The Retail Economist, a Tucson, Ariz.-based economic forecasting firm. Michael Niemira, chief economist there, had in May forecast that June same-store sales would likely rise in the range of 1% to 2%.June's A WallflowerTypically, June acts as a lull between Mother's Day shopping in May and when back-to-school sales ramp up in late July and early August. ""June is sort of a transitionary month,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, who called the numbers ""lackluster.""Warm weather and a falling unemployment rate haven't been enough to muster consistent growth in the retailers still providing monthly sales statistics.""The long-term impact that the Great Recession has had has definitely tempered spending,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Wage increases have been very small during the recovery. The retailers are still waiting for the consumer to show up.""One of those retailers, Costco (COST), was hurt by the strong dollar and fallen gasoline prices as its overall June showing of a 1% decline missed the consensus of a 0.1% decline. It was Costco's sixth miss during the past seven months.Gasoline prices have rebounded to a degree since last year's 50% collapse in crude oil prices, but they're still below where prices were a year earlier. Excluding gasoline, the Issaquah, Wash.-based warehouse club notched a 6% gain, ahead of views forecasting a 5.2% gain, indicating Costco's underlying domestic business is strong.Gap's (GPS) same-store sales fell a worse-than-expected 1% in June. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.7%. June sales at its Old Navy unit grew a disappointing 1%, less than the 2.3% consensus. Banana Republic did better than expected, growing sales 1%, vs. the 0.2% decline forecast. Gap's namesake clothing stores saw a 5% year-over-year fall in same-store sales, worse than the 3.9% drop that was predicted.L Brands (LB), the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, notched a 3% gain compared with a year ago, but just missed views of 3.1%.The clothing on its models wasn't the only scant adornment at Victoria's Secret. Its sales growth was skimpy, notching a 1% gain in June, below a forecast for 3.2%. Bath & Body Works was the stronger performer of the two L Brands units, posting a 6% gain, beating views calling for a 3.8% increase in sales.""Young consumers more interested in what kind of smartphone they have instead of what they're wearing,"" Perkins said.Stein Mart (SMRT), a Jacksonville, Fla.-based discount retailer, was the strongest performer in the Retail Metrics index, posting a 5.8% gain compared with June 2014, doubling estimates of 2.9%.""Overall, we've seen a little bit of sluggishness since the beginning of the year; that's mirrored the broader sluggishness we've seen in the economy,"" said Niemira.Teen clothing retailer Buckle (BKE) edged a 0.5% gain, beating estimates calling for a 1.1% decline.Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), highly rated by IBD, jumped more than 4% in the stock market Thursday after an upbeat quarterly report. It noted domestic comparable-store sales growth of 1.6% for the quarter ended in May.Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) saw a 2.4% increase in June same-store sales, missing views of 2.9%. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company's sales were powered primarily by its pharmacy unit, which grew by 3.4%, just missing the consensus of 3.5%. Rite Aid's front-end sales rose 0.3% from a year earlier, falling short of forecasts of a 1.8% gain.Specialty clothier Zumiez (ZUMZ) had a 3.3% decline in sales, performing worse than the 3.2% drop that analysts expected.Cato (CATO), a Charlotte, N.C.-based women's fashion retailer, posted no gain in June sales, better than the 1% decline forecast.Fred's (FRED), a discount retailer based in Memphis, Tenn., fell short of views, posting a 1.6% year-over-year gain; analysts expected 1.9%.San Diego-based warehouse club PriceSmart (PSMT) turned in a 4% gain in June comparable sales, beating the forecast for 3%. Its quarterly report after the bell Thursday fell short of expectations, though, and the stock slipped after hours.Home ImprovementsDespite retail being flat for June, consumers have opened their wallets in other areas, such as home improvement. Firms such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) announced in May they had strong Q1 sales.The impact of lower gasoline prices — a problem for Costco's revenue — is being felt as a positive effect in other areas of the U.S. economy, Niemira told IBD.""Anything house-related seems to have picked up,"" he said.

2134,L,"The housing market is back. A closely watched sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) hit a high not seen since the heady days of the housing bubble.Homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) hit new highs, as did home improvement giant Home Depot (HD).The NAHB index rose 1 point in August to 61. Two subindexes, measuring current sales conditions and the next 6 months, were relatively unchanged at high levels: 66 and 70, respectively.The traffic index rose by 2 points. At 45, it's still below the neutral 50 mark — but traffic has been above that mark only briefly, and that was just before the bubble burst.If homebuilders are bullish, it's probably a signal that housing is in good shape. It could also be a good sign for the rest of the economy, since a humming housing market propels so much other activity, especially hiring.Horton shares rose 2% to a 9-year high Monday. LGI fell lightly after making an all-time high; Lennar (LEN) rose 3% and PulteGroup (PHM) 1%.Meanwhile, in the mobile software industry, GrubHub (GRUB) is facing pressure in online food delivery from rivals led by ride-summoning service Uber, which recently began highlighting its big push into food delivery with a new look on its app.Uber had buried the UberEats app at the bottom of its site. But starting last week, UberEats has appeared prominently next to Uber's car-summoning icon. It's the latest salvo in the app-based food delivery service wars, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman in a research report on Monday.""We view this as a subtle but significant change recognizing food delivery as Uber's second major category ahead of a broader rollout,"" wrote Kopelman.Uber is hiring for its UberEats on-demand meal-delivery service in at least nine U.S. cities and could operate in as many as 15 cities in coming months, Kopelman says.""UberEATS remains small today in both geographic scope, food options and user adoption. However, Uber's recent moves signal some traction in markets where UberEATS has rolled out and point to aggressive expansion of food delivery as a core Uber service,"" Kopelman said.Uber is pioneering the ""ultrafast"" food category, offering a limited selection of prepared foods in thermal bags that couriers deliver within 10 minutes for a flat all-in delivery fee of $3 to $4.Competition from Uber and other companies that deliver food — which include Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — is pressuring GrubHub's order growth, which slowed to a 25% year-over-year gain in Q2 2015 from 33% in Q4 2014, wrote Kopelman. ""We note that new competitors, most notably Postmates, Yelp (YELP)-owned Eat24, DoorDash, Munchery, Caviar and UberEATS, are on track to capture 50% of U.S. industry growth in fiscal 2015 vs. 25% in 2014, and (excluding Uber) have raised $500 million year to date,"" Kopelman wrote.

2144,L,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly has cut its Apple Watch production in half because of problems producing displays for the new smartwatch.Taiwanese publication UDN Mobile on Tuesday said that Apple has slashed its per-month shipment target to 1.25 million to 1.5 million units, from 2.5 million to 3 million units. The news outlet says it has spoken to sources in Apple's supply chain, including contract manufacturer Quanta.The cutbacks are related to production issues for a new type of display for Apple: active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED). UDN Mobile said LG Display (LPL) is the initial exclusive supplier of the AMOLED screen for the Apple Watch.To date, Apple has used liquid crystal display (LCD) screens for its mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPod Touch. But AMOLED offers lower power consumption and richer colors than LCD.But 9to5Mac threw cold water on the report, saying the original source of the UDN Mobile story, the Economic Daily News, has a dubious track record for Apple product news.9to5Mac writer Mike Beasley said he doubts that a supply chain expert like Apple CEO Tim Cook would sole-source a key component like the Apple Watch display. He suggests that Apple is likely to be relying on another manufacturer, such as Samsung or Sharp, to cover any shortages from one vendor.Meanwhile, AppleInsider says reports of late production issues are overblown. However, Apple will be supply-constrained when it launches the Apple Watch on April 24, the news site said. People will be able to check out the new device in Apple stores on April 10, when pre-orders begin.Manufacturing issues are common during the ramp-up of any new Apple product, AppleInsider said. The Apple Watch is no different and is packed with new technologies, such as the Digital Crown and heart-rate sensor, packed into a small device.The potential demand for the Apple Watch remains a hotly debated topic.A survey by Ipsos and Reuters released Friday shows that awareness of the Apple Watch is high, but purchase intent is iffy. Ipsos surveyed nearly 2,500 adult Americans online March 9 to 17. It found that 53% were aware of the upcoming Apple Watch release.The majority of respondents (51%) believe that smartwatches are a passing fad. Some 32% disagreed and the rest were undecided.The survey found that about 10% of people are ""very interested"" in buying the Apple Watch, while about 15% are ""somewhat interested."" The percentage of respondents who are interested in buying the Apple Watch rounded to 24%. Some 69% said they were not interested in the Apple Watch, with the remaining 7% undecided.RELATED:Apple Watch sales could be hurt by pricing, battery life .

2146,L,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) stock rose 11.5% to an all-time high Friday on heavy volume as speculation builds that the company could be the next big biotech takeout.The stock jumped as investment bank UBS raised its price target on BioMarin Pharmaceutical stock to 136 from 112.Deutsche Bank also raised its price target on Friday, to 140 from 90, and an analyst for the investment bank suggested that BioMarin might make an attractive target, MarketWatch reported.The San Rafael, Calif.-based company in late February posted Q4 revenue that rose 57% year over year to $230.9 million and beat analyst expectations by $42 million.BioMarin lowered its per-share loss minus items to 8 cents from 11 cents in Q4 2013.When IBD asked in an interview last year when he expected the company to become profitable, BioMarin CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime said, ""Things are changing with the acquisition of Prosensa. We believe it will be significantly accretive to our P&L in 2017, and at that time we should be GAAP profitable if we get accelerated approval (for drisapersen) in the U.S. and Europe in 2015.""In November, BioMarin agreed to pay $680 million upfront for Prosensa Holding, a Dutch biotech developing a drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy called drisapersen. Drisapersen succeeded in its phase two trial but failed its phase three, causing partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to end their relationship.At BioMarin's investor day on Dec. 10, executives said that their experience in launching orphan drugs should help them get drisapersen approved on the phase two data.BioMarin already has four products out for rare diseases, led by Naglazyme, which treats a life-threatening enzyme deficiency called mucopolysaccharidosis VI.

"
2149,L,"The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Why such a soft forecast?""July auto sales were quite robust,"" Perkins told IBD. ""That, in my estimation, is pulling money away from traditional retailers.""The weather was particularly hot across the country in July, he adds, which likely kept shoppers out of the malls as they headed to the beach and other outdoor venues.Another key factor leading to the softness is that consumers aren't seeing wage gains and are ""cautious with their spending,"" Perkins says.Perkins says the projected soft showing for the month suggests that the back-to-school shopping season is ""going to be a difficult one for most retailers.""The back-to-school shopping season started in late July and runs through mid-September.Costco Wholesale (COST) is projected to see an 0.2% decline in July same-store sales. But its core U.S. same-store sales are expected to lead the pack with a healthy 5.7% increase from a year earlier, excluding gasoline and foreign exchange drags.Regional discount chain Stein Mart (SMRT)is also forecast to outpace most of the group with a 3.5% increase in July same-store sales.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is expected to see a 2.7% decline in July same-store sales. But its Old Navy brand is seen posting a 4.1% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is estimated to show a 1.9% rise in July same-store sales.Last Thursday, drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) posted a 2.4% increase in July same-store sales, in line with estimates.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is expected to see a 3.3% gain.

But Wall Street analysts were looking for 573,000 additions for the quarter ended Feb. 27.Adobe stock was down 3.5%, below 77, in midday trading on the stock market today.""We think it was a good number, but people would have liked to have seen more,"" Adobe Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett told IBD. ""It was a really good quarter and if you're going to focus just on the 517 (thousand new subscribers), you're missing the bigger story anyway.""Creative Cloud subscriber additions in Q1 were reduced by a reporting change, he said. With the launch of the company's new Document Cloud, Adobe is no longer lumping Acrobat subscribers in with Creative Cloud subscribers, he told IBD.""That change had a significant impact on the subscriber number for Creative Cloud in the quarter,"" Garrett said.A better figure for investors to focus on is Adobe's annualized recurring revenue, he said. That number has been increasing since Adobe began its transition to an Internet cloud business model. Annualized recurring revenue reached $2.09 billion in Adobe's digital media businesses last quarter.Adobe's Q1 also showed that the company is becoming more profitable now that it is emerging from its transition from pay-upfront software to pay-as-you-go software.""If you look at the revenue and earnings we generated this quarter, it really shows that the P&L is coming back in a very big way, which is terrific,"" Garrett said. ""We're through the financial part of this transition.""Adobe earned 44 cents a share, excluding stock-based compensation and other items, for its fiscal first quarter, up 46% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 11% to $1.109 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Adobe to earn 39 cents a share on sales of $1.085 billion.For fiscal Q2, Adobe expects adjusted EPS of 44 cents on sales of $1.15 billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling 48 cents and $1.18 billion, but Adobe is known to be conservative with guidance.Adobe has three pillars to its cloud strategy: Creative Cloud, which includes creative professional software like Photoshop and Illustrator; Marketing Cloud, which provides online marketing tools; and Document Cloud, which extends Adobe's Acrobat and PDF standard.""Adobe is an arms dealer to the creative and marketing worlds,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams said in a research note Wednesday. ""The growth of the Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud should provide investors with good returns over the next few years. We are excited to see revenues rebound this year as the transition to a mostly subscription and recurring revenue model is nearing completion.""Adobe also is managing operating expenses tightly, which helps with earnings, he said. Adams rates Adobe stock as a buy.

2213,L,"Lawlessness: On Day 768 of the IRS scandal targeting political dissidents, the tax agency said it has more emails to release. Only it can't release them until September because it must ensure there are no duplicates. Baloney.Missing yet another court-ordered deadline on June 12, the Internal Revenue Service has failed to release 6,400 new emails found on the hard drive of Lois Lerner, former tax exempt organization chief, pertaining to the agency's admitted targeting of administration critics.The agency is being investigated by Congress and scrutinized by the group Judicial Watch.These are among the same emails whose release to congressional investigators had already been delayed by more than a year on errant claims by the IRS commissioner that the entire cache had been lost.Now, instead of that dog-ate-my-homework claim, the excuse is that the IRS only wants to make sure there are no duplicates in the bunch, a peculiar fastidiousness given how the agency has stopped answering most taxpayer phone calls .Let's cut to the chase here: The IRS is obstructing justice because it doesn't want the truth to come out . The agency has been caught red-handed targeting opponents of the Obama administration, including the tea party, pro-Israel groups and conservative news media.It purposely delayed issuances of tax-exempt status to nonprofit groups and held investigations entirely outside its own mandate.What the IRS is hiding is bound to be the work of malicious political operatives cloaking themselves as impartial civil servants, plotting among themselves against their political enemies through email.The stiff-arms given by the IRS at every juncture — from Lerner's invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a House hearing to this latest claim about preventing duplicates — is consistent with that scenario.As a result, the IRS is moving closer and closer to rogue status — an agency so contemptuous of the law and confident of its impunity that it's becoming a law unto itself.Would the IRS itself be just as casual about deadlines if private citizens failed to file their taxes by April 15?Would it show understanding to a corporation that said it had lost all its emails with tax records in some sort of server crash that somehow wiped the whole thing clean?Does the IRS let anyone it has accused of tax evasion take the Fifth or withhold the incriminating evidence?Absolutely not. Yet it somehow expects the courts and Congress to go along with the sloppiness and obstruction it would never tolerate in the people it ""serves.""This raises questions about why the agency continues to escape justice. On Day 768 (as indefatigable TaxProf blog Professor Paul L. Caron has calculated) of this scandal, it's getting increasingly obvious that this agency intends to block any inquiry into its doings and avoid any accountability for its actions.It is dragging and delaying the process in hopes it will get a change of Congress or, better still, dogged investigators will lose interest. It's a war of attrition, a scorched-earth campaign, not just on dissidents but even more pointedly on the law itself.With each lawless act, the credibility of the agency is reduced and the case for the agency's abolition grows stronger. Already some presidential candidates, such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, are raising that possibility.If the IRS thinks it can just wait out and exhaust anyone seeking accountability and justice, it's likely to find itself in for a surprise. Justice's wheels turn slowly, but in the U.S. they eventually turn.It ought to think of itself as an institution instead of just a political arm of a party whose permanent hold on power is anything but certain.

Companies currently authorized by the FAA to fly drones in the country include Trimble Navigation (TRMB) and AeroVironment (AVAV).

2259,L,"Apple (AAPL) might be getting ready to follow rival Samsung's lead in using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays for its smartphones.Apple currently uses liquid crystal display (LCD) screens for its iPhones. But OLED displays are thinner and more power-efficient, and have higher color saturation than LCDs. OLED displays are also flexible.Apple's first product to use an OLED display is the Apple Watch, which hit the market on April 24. Teardowns show that the smartwatch uses an active-matrix OLED display from LG Display (LPL).Shares of OLED technology firm Universal Display (OLED) hit a more than three-year high on Friday, closing up 1.7% at 53.46. The stock rose on speculation that Apple will soon start using OLED displays in its next-generation iPhone handset and iPad tablet, Zacks Equity Research said Thursday. Universal Display licenses its technology to LG Display, Samsung, AU Optronics (AUO) and other companies.If the rumors are true, one question is: When will Apple switch to OLED from LCD for iPhones and iPads?With the next version of the iPhone due out in September, the change might not happen until 2016, the Motley Fool suggested.Smartphones with OLED displays include the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, LG G Flex 2 and Lenovo's Sisley S90, Motorola Moto X and Motorola Droid Turbo.RELATED:Apple Watch gross margins will start low but then rise.

2260,L,"Imagine a PGA tour where the world's best golfers earn a pittance for endorsement deals. Mark McCormack couldn't. In 1959 the Cleveland attorney was moonlighting as a tournament organizer when he overheard players complaining about how little money they were earning.Few were as frustrated as Arnold Palmer, golf's top player and arguably the nation's most exciting athlete, who landed a whopping $500 and all the ketchup he could eat for pushing the Heinz condiment.""Appalling,"" McCormack said.The game was about to change.After hooking up with Palmer in late '59, McCormack set out to prove that corporations would pay enormous sums for celebrity athletes to endorse their products.In his first two years with McCormack, Palmer's annual earnings skyrocketed from $60,000 to $500,000.By 1967, the golfer's businesses, under McCormack's management, were ringing up sales of $15 million, worth $100 million today.Using Palmer as his springboard, McCormack (1930-2003) went on to create the International Management Group, a billion-dollar firm that represented a stable of sporting legends from Bjorn Borg and Jean-Claude Killy to Tiger Woods and Derek Jeter.By the time McCormack died, his Cleveland-based company had 80 offices in 32 countries employing almost 3,000 people.Rich LegacyForbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1 billion.Over the course of his groundbreaking career, Golf magazine called McCormack ""the most powerful man in golf.""Tennis magazine said he was ""the most powerful man in tennis.""Sports Illustrated cited him as ""the most powerful man in sports.""And the Times of London noted he was ""one of the 1,000 people who have most influenced the 20th century.""""I don't think it's an overstatement to say that kind of like Henry Ford and Bill Gates, Mark McCormack literally created and fostered and led an entirely new worldwide industry,"" CBS (CBS) Sports Chairman Sean McManus said following McCormack's death.McCormack was born in Chicago, the only child of a farm journal publisher. Mark's self-discipline came from his German-Irish mother, who always laid out breakfast the night before and planned her family's day to the split second.Mark was just 6 when he was hit by a car and suffered a fractured skull. His doctors said that contact sports like football and basketball were out, so he turned to golf.A steady player, he won the Chicago high school title and went on to play No. 1 at William & Mary.During a match with Wake Forest, he met Palmer, the star of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.After graduation from Yale Law School and a hitch with the Army, McCormack joined a Cleveland law firm but walked away after his handshake deal with Palmer.""He was an old-school businessman whose word was his bond,"" Jon Franklin, CEO of Glory Sports International and a former agent with IMG, told IBD. ""You could do a deal on a napkin, and he'd stick by his word.""After starting IMG in 1960, McCormack quickly snared lucrative exhibitions and endorsements for Palmer, who won the U.S. Open that year. As reigning champ into 1961, Arnie endorsed L&M; cigarettes on one of the first TV commercials to use an athlete.In short order, McCormack also signed a talented South African newcomer by the name of Gary Player and a young American professional called Jack Nicklaus.The Big Three dominated golf for the next decade. With McCormack netting them big deals, money poured in for everything from appearance fees to corporate outings.""He realized how much sports were part of the culture,"" said Kirstin Kay, archivist at the Mark H. McCormack Department of Sport Management at the University of Massachusetts. ""He realized there was a real entertainment factor.""In 1968, McCormack went international, signing Killy after the French skier won three gold medals in the Winter Olympics.A year later, McCormack added Australian tennis champion Rod Laver and Scottish race car driver Jackie Stewart.""I could have stayed with the big three golfers, as Col. Parker did with Elvis Presley, or take the idea into other sports,"" McCormack told the London Sunday Times. ""I signed up Stewart, Laver and Killy. After that, people started coming to me, because the market was crying out for someone like me, and I seemed to be the only one with a track record.""At the same time, McCormack began opening offices in Tokyo, Australia, South Africa and across Europe — establishing a foreign beachhead long before global trade was much discussed. ""He was willing to go into markets and stay the course even while losing money for years,"" Franklin said.TV VisionMcCormack was one of the first to merge the rapidly growing TV industry with the sports world, increasing the marquee value of his athletes and such historic sporting events as tennis' Wimbledon and golf's British Open.His broadcast division was the largest producer of televised sports programming, other than the networks, and the largest seller of sports TV rights. To gain more exposure for his clients, he created events such as ""The Superstars"" (1973-2003) and ""World's Strongest Man,"" which debuted in 1977.""He created new ways to capitalize on what was then new media,"" Franklin said. ""He saw very quickly that to get deals for his clients, he needed to get them exposure on television. Once you start creating these events, they have to be on television. So he created a television division.""Into the 1980s, IMG expanded again, branching out to represent authors, classical musicians, fashion models, even the pope. ""He led a very driven life,"" Kay said. ""He was incredibly tightly managed.""To keep pace with his business demands, he ran his life with military precision, rising at 4:30 a.m. and scheduling every moment of his day, including naps, exercise and playtime with his three children. He allowed only four hours a day for rest, trained himself to go to sleep as soon as he got into bed and kept his watch 10 minutes fast so as to be punctual for meetings. ""He would say, 'In six months' time, on September 2 at 10:00, I'll call you,'"" Killy said. ""Six months later at 10:00 he'd call, on the nose.""On The GoAll of his ventures made McCormack a prolific traveler, logging up to 200,000 miles a year, nearly all on commercial airlines.Though he had homes in New York, London, Cleveland and Orlando, Fla., half his time was spent in places where he had no home.In one two-month period in 1994, he was in London; Geneva; Zurich; Singapore; New York; Cleveland; Chicago; Los Angeles; St. Andrews, Scotland; Tokyo; Mexico City; Williamsburg, Va.; Orlando; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He kept busy during his travel by writing books, many on management, including ""What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School,"" a best-seller in 1984.McCormack went all over with stacks of index cards, which he used to jot down everything from notes on people and projects to his exercise and sleeping habits. ""His three-by-fives were about the best in the world,"" Palmer said. ""He could pull a three-by-five out and tell you how many pushups he did 10 years ago or how many situps.""McCormack's first marriage, in 1954 to Nancy Breckenridge, ended in divorce after three children. A second marriage came in 1986, to the tennis player Betsy Nagelsen, twice an Australian Open doubles champion, and they had a daughter.A year after McCormack died at age 72, Forstmann Little, a private equity firm, bought IMG for $750 million. In 2013 the company sold IMG to the entertainment talent agency William Morris Endeavor and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for $2.3 billion.Despite the changes in ownership, McCormack's legacy as the godfather of sports marketing remains intact, 55 years after his landmark handshake with Palmer.""I had luck,"" McCormack told London's Sunday Times. ""I saw those two big things (television and high-profile athletes), and suddenly everybody started relating to sports. It was an easy sell. As stupid as it may seem today to say that Tiger Woods wearing Nike (NKE) can make a lot of money for Nike, people weren't doing that then.""

While the cup with handle is one of the most common winning chart patterns, the related and more rare cup without handle is also worthy of study.

2337,L,"Rumors of a big-screen iPad perked up this week with a report that Apple (AAPL) hopes to use a new type of touch panel for the jumbo-size tablet.Citing unnamed sources in the supply chain, Korea IT News reported Monday that Apple has requested silver nanowire display samples from LG Display (LPL), Samsung Display and others for the so-called iPad Pro tablet, AppleInsider reported Monday.The silver nanowire touch display would be more flexible than current displays and could enable the deployment of Force Touch technology. Apple uses Force Touch in the Apple Watch to distinguish between different touches like a tap and a press. Apple is rumored to be looking to add Force Touch to its next smartphone, the iPhone 6S, this fall.The iPad Pro would have a 12.9-inch display, vs. the 9.7-inch display of the current iPad. It might even use a stylus for applications that involve writing, drawing or annotating.That development would put the iPad Pro in direct competition with Microsoft's (MSFT) Surface Pro 3, a 12-inch tablet that converts to a notebook when connected to a thin and lightweight keyboard accessory. Microsoft is expected to announce a follow-on product, the Surface Pro 4, this summer, timed with the release of Windows 10.The iPad Pro might not be released until 2016, AppleInsider said.Apple is looking for ways to lift its sagging iPad sales. The company has teamed with IBM (IBM) to develop enterprise applications for the tablet.RELATED:Apple iPad, Tablets' Best Growth Years Are History.

2381,L,"Ewing, N.J.-based Universal Display (OLED) rocketed, then drifted back down like a signal flare early Monday, drawing attention to the LED lighting market.
"
2382,L,"Universal spiked 22% at the open, after announcing an eight-year licensing and supply agreement with South Korea's LG Display (LPL). The deal revolves around OLEDs — organic light emitting diodes that generate light via organic, rather than artificially manufactured, chemicals reacting with the current produced by the LED chips.
"
2383,L,"OLED fans say the technology allows thinner, higher resolution screens than technologies such as liquid crystal display designs using LED backlighting.
"
2384,L,"The deal underscores increasingly complex LED markets. Edwin Mok, analyst with Needham & Co., estimates LED market growth will slow to 10% this year after a 22% gain in 2014. In addition, overcapacity and a widening crowd of competitors are driving down prices and profit margins across the industry.
"
2385,L,"The LED market is home to familiar names including Cree (CREE) and Netherlands-based Koninklijke Philips (PHG). But China has funded a vast buildup of LED production capacity. LG also contends with South Korean compatriot Samsung Electronics, as well as Taiwan-based LED giants including Epistar (which scored $22.2 billion in 2013 revenue) and Everlight Technologies (2013 revenue of $24.7 billion).
"
2386,L,"Despite that backdrop, analysts expect LG Display's earnings to rise 33% in 2015. That's a steep slowdown from a forecast of 137% growth in 2014 (providing LG meets projections for a 622% gain in Q4). Sales, which have wobbled back and forth for the past four years, are expected to slip 3% in 2014, then rise 9% for 2015.

2389,L,"The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating is a comparatively weak 72 out of a maximum 99 score. But its relative strength line has jabbed higher since the start of January.Ewing, N.J.-based Universal Display (OLED) rocketed, then drifted back down like a signal flare early Monday, drawing attention to the LED lighting market.Universal spiked 22% at the open, after announcing an eight-year licensing and supply agreement with South Korea's LG Display (LPL). The deal revolves around OLEDs — organic light emitting diodes that generate light via organic, rather than artificially manufactured, chemicals reacting with the current produced by the LED chips.OLED fans say the technology allows thinner, higher resolution screens than technologies such as liquid crystal display designs using LED backlighting.The deal underscores increasingly complex LED markets. Edwin Mok, analyst with Needham & Co., estimates LED market growth will slow to 10% this year after a 22% gain in 2014. In addition, overcapacity and a widening crowd of competitors are driving down prices and profit margins across the industry.The LED market is home to familiar names including Cree (CREE) and Netherlands-based Koninklijke Philips (PHG). But China has funded a vast buildup of LED production capacity. LG also contends with South Korean compatriot Samsung Electronics, as well as Taiwan-based LED giants including Epistar (which scored $22.2 billion in 2013 revenue) and Everlight Technologies (2013 revenue of $24.7 billion).Despite that backdrop, analysts expect LG Display's earnings to rise 33% in 2015. That's a steep slowdown from a forecast of 137% growth in 2014 (providing LG meets projections for a 622% gain in Q4). Sales, which have wobbled back and forth for the past four years, are expected to slip 3% in 2014, then rise 9% for 2015.The company's American depositary shares trade an average 310,000 shares a day.

2399,L,"If you've been trading options for any length of time, you've probably experienced some surprises in your P/L. When using options, changes in volatility and changes in prices can result in a quick profit or you could experience a quick loss. How do you handle this? 
"
2400,L,"This is not an easy question to answer but there are step you can take to improve your results. Over the years, I've realized how important it is to understand and manage your risk. 
"
2401,L,"Here are some steps to consider helping you manage your risk: 
"
2402,L,"1) Always understand your overall POSITION risk —If you are establishing a position as an Iron Condor or a Credit Spread for example, your max loss is the width of your spread less the credit you receive. Sometimes when you establish a position, you can be far away price wise from the max loss, but always remember that a quick gap against you can get you to the max loss faster than you may think. If you are buying options or Debit Spreads your risk is normally limited to the amount you pay, but again make sure the amount you pay for the trade is not more than you are willing to lose if the trade goes against you. Whether selling or buying options, always know where your max risk and max loss points are (which is further explained in step 2). 
"
2403,L,"2) What is your personal risk ""limit""? — You should always know your max RISK vs your max LOSS on any trade. In most cases, your max RISK is not your max LOSS. For example, if you have max risk of $5000 on a trade, this may not mean you are willing to take a $5000 LOSS. You may be willing to take a $500 or a $1000 loss on a trade, but again your potential RISK may be $5000. There is a difference and you should always know your max LOSS point to close the trade and get out. You need to always have your personal number in your mind and be consistent with it. In other words, don't lose $500 on one trade and $10,000 on another. The way to be successful trading options is to strive for consistency. Don't let one trade blow you up. 
"
2404,L,"3) How does each trade relate to your overall portfolio? This is something a lot of people don't seem to think about. If you have 10 trades in your options portfolio and they are all Bullish or all Bearish, your entire portfolio can get crushed by a big swing one way or the other. It is perfectly fine to ""lean"" your overall portfolio one way or the other based on your own personal market outlook, but ideally you may want a few trades that ""offset"" each other. For example, if you are going to use 10 total trades, it is not a bad idea to have 5 bullish and 5 bearish trades so that if the market goes up you make money and if it goes down, you can still make money. 
"
2405,L,"4) How often will you be able to monitor your trades? This may sound like a straightforward question, but this can make a big difference in your results. If you are not able to watch the market during the day, try to use trades that are much further out in time (expiration). For example, you can use longer dated Iron Condors or Butterflies that won't react violently to gaps up or down in the market. If you can't watch the market closely, you should consider avoiding weekly options or very short term options. We all know how fast the market and our trade positions can change and if you are not watching, you may not have time to avoid a quick move and a quick loss. 
"
2406,L,"5) Protect your Mental Capital — Generally when things are going well with the market, things are going well in your overall portfolio. On the other hand, when the market gets ugly, your entire portfolio can turn ugly quickly. It is best to cut your losers quickly and go to cash when this happens. In my experience, one of the worst things is to hold onto a losing trade and jeopardize your other positions. We tend to wait and hope the loser will get better and it takes your focus off your other positions that you may need to be managing. If you have a loser trade, and you find yourself lying in bed at night worrying about it, this is the time to cut it loose. 
"
2407,L,"I have tried to cover some general concepts here that may help you to think about your risk in a different way and help you to be able to avoid some losses. Always remember that if you wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning in a cold sweat worrying about your options positions, you have a problem. Either you have too much overall at risk, you have too large a position or a general overall risk level too high in your portfolio. Options trading should be a fun and exciting experience, not a risky and terrifying one. Make your money work for you and not the other way around.

2424,L,"The ""Uncarrier""-branded promotions of T-Mobile US (TMUS) will deliver sustainable, positive free cash flow as it continues to gain subscribers despite fierce wireless competition, says Morgan Stanley, which rates T-Mobile a top global telecom stock pick along with Vodafone (VOD) and China Unicom (CHU).T-Mobile, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), will eke out $47 million in free cash flow in 2015, estimates Morgan Stanley. Analyst Simon Flannery forecasts that T-Mobile will churn out $774 million in FCF in 2016, $1.68 billion in 2017 and $2.13 billion in 2018. Free cash flow is generally defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures.T-Mobile's aggressive promotions have taken a toll on ARPU, or average revenue per user. But Flannery expects ARPU to stabilize.""We believe there is more room for the Uncarrier initiative,"" said Flannery in a research report. ""We are looking for ARPU stabilization, EBITDA growth and signs of positive free cash flow. T-Mobile has the most radio spectrum per subscriber, and has positioned itself as the customer-friendly carrier.""T-Mobile on April 28 raised its 2015 guidance for postpaid subscriber additions after adding 991,000 phone customers in Q1, taking customers from AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).T-Mobile's aggressive Uncarrier promotions, which started with equipment installment payment plans for mobile phones, spurred its subscriber growth in 2013 and 2014. EIP reduces upfront retail subsidies on mobile phones, while revenue is booked upfront. EIP offers usually come with discounts on data service, lowering ARPU.Morgan Stanley also rates Vodafone and China Unicom as top global telecom picks.""We view Vodafone as the best way to play the three most important themes (in) the European sector: mobile data monetization, waning regulatory headwinds and market consolidation,"" said the report.Morgan Stanley's ""least preferred"" telecom picks include Sprint (S), America Movil (AMX) and India's Bharti.

2426,L,"Real estate investment trusts are outperforming in the stock market, up 8% this year as an IBD industry group after doubling the S&P 500's 11% gain in 2014. And factoring in dividends, REITs delivered a total return of 27.5% for the year, according to SNL Financial.One of the top-rated names in IBD's Finance-Property REIT group — which ranks No. 22 out of 197 industries tracked — is Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB). It invests in upscale hotel and resort properties primarily in large U.S. markets.The company's portfolio tends toward four-diamond boutique hotels in big cities such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. The AAA travel site defines four-diamond hotels as ""upscale in all areas,"" with ""an extensive array of amenities combined with a high degree of hospitality, service and attention to detail.""Pebblebrook's properties include the Hotel Monaco in Seattle and Washington, D.C.; the Le Meridien Delfina in Los Angeles; the Westin Gaslamp in San Diego; the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco; the InterContinental Buckhead in Atlanta; and the Affinity Manhattan in New York.Hot In HotelsThe company owns all or part of 35 hotels with a total of nearly 7,000 guest rooms and a 49% joint venture interest in six hotels with a total of 1,775 guest rooms.It boasts an IBD Composite Rating of 99, which puts it atop the Finance-Property REIT group along with Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and Sun Communities (SUI), among others.Like those companies, Pebblebrook has seen its share price hit record highs this month. The company is also in the middle of a long run of double-digit-percentage earnings and revenue gains, thanks to a mix of favorable macro trends and strong internal operations.On the macro side, the tourism industry in general and the hotel business in particular have gotten a boost from an improving economy, lower gas prices and an influx of visitors from overseas, particularly in large urban markets.""The fundamentals are very good for the hotel industry right now, and they're improving,"" said Pebblebrook Chief Financial Officer Raymond Martz.Overall demand for U.S. hotel rooms in 2014 rose 4.5% from the prior year, he told IBD. ""That's a very strong increase. At the same time, supply was only up 0.9%. So right now demand is very good.""On the operational side, Pebblebrook boasts a ""high-quality portfolio"" and some of the highest room rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the hotel sector, according to a recent note by Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik.During its third quarter, Pebblebrook posted an 11.4% year-over-year increase in same-property RevPAR to $225.25 a day. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, same-property RevPAR climbed 9.8% from a year earlier.Those growth numbers are expected to decelerate this year as Pebblebrook focuses on integrating a handful of new properties. On Jan. 22 the company issued its 2015 outlook and guided same-property RevPAR growth of 6.5% to 7.5%.Pebblebrook focuses on buying underperforming hotels and turning them around. The company completed more than $600 million worth of acquisitions in 2014, Martz says.""A lot of assets we buy are broken,"" he said. ""In many cases they were mismanaged or are being renovated, or the prior owners lost their focus for whatever reason. So we work to renovate the hotels, reposition the room rates and make the properties appeal to a certain kind of traveler.""Restoring GrandeurThe job involves ""a lot of hard work and creativity,"" Martz says. ""There's a lot more operating involvement vs. buying an office building and leasing it out for five years. You have to bring in the right food and beverage operator, create the right atmosphere.""Pebblebrook's most recent deal came on Dec. 18, when it announced the acquisition of the Revere Hotel Boston Common, an attached, 826-space parking garage and an adjacent land parcel. That deal, for $260.4 million, brought the company a 356-room hotel in downtown Boston's historic Theater District.The Revere buyout came a week after Pebblebrook spent about $52 million to purchase the Union Station Hotel, a 125-room property in downtown Nashville, Tenn., that first opened in 1900 as the L&N Railroad Station. The property was converted to a hotel in 1986.Other recent deals include the Nov. 20 purchase of the Hotel Palomar Los Angeles-Westwood for $78.7 million and the Nov. 12 buyout of Miami's Westin Colonnade Coral Gables for $59.4 million.Looking For The GemsWhen pursuing acquisitions, Pebblebrook looks at properties ""that can be positioned as four-diamond hotels,"" Martz said.""We get hotels that cater to business travelers as well as high-end leisure travelers,"" he added. ""About two-thirds are considered boutique hotels, and we have a lot of flexibility in tailoring those hotels to specific travelers.""Pebblebrook's near-term expansion strategy will likely focus on West Coast markets because that's where most of the new supply is, he says.Analysts credit the company with doing a good job of turning acquired properties around.""PEB has actively acquired hotels that lost market share due to the recession and has allocated capital ... to reposition these hotels to recapture market share,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Wes Golladay noted in a research report.He says Pebblebrook's increased acquisition volume will be ""a key driver of increased shareholder value.""That value keeps going up. Pebblebrook shares touched a record high of 49.61 on Jan. 22 and have risen more than 60% over the past 12 months.

"
2436,L,"On the fifth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act this week, one issue remains constant: There is a great need to find a solution to skyrocketing health care costs.
"
2437,L,"The answer lies in a simple reform: eliminating defensive medicine.
"
2438,L,"Defensive medicine is defined as unnecessary tests, procedures and medications of no clinical value that a physician orders as legal protection from a medical malpractice lawsuit. Doctors have the greatest influence on health care costs as they are the ones that order patient expenditures, and physicians nationwide validate that defensive medicine is a problem.
"
2439,L,"Gallup, in a nationwide survey of physicians, found in 2010 that one in four health care dollars spent on patients — or $650 billion annually — can be attributed to defensive medicine.
"
2440,L,"Most doctors will tell you their greatest fear in the practice of medicine is a medical malpractice lawsuit. It influences how they treat patients every day. According to a 2011 Pacific Survey, 92% of physicians in the U.S. reported practicing defensive medicine, while the response rate was zero for Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
"
2441,L,"A doctor will practice defensive medicine, for example, if a patient presents himself with chest pains and the cardiologist does blood work and finds the patient is not having a heart attack. To avoid a lawsuit, the doctor may still order additional costly tests such as an echocardiogram, a CT scan or an MRI.
"
2442,L,"In 2012, the independent health care economics firm BioScience Valuation estimated $140 billion in Medicare and $120 billion in Medicaid plans are spent on defensive medicine annually.
"
2443,L,"Unfortunately, when Congress debated the ACA it failed to address medical malpractice, and the impact of defensive medicine on the cost of health care. Health care has and will continue to remain unaffordable unless we tackle defensive medicine.
"
2444,L,"Consumer spending on health care jumped 16% from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2014, according the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Health care spending is projected to continue growing faster than our economy between 2013 and 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
"
2445,L,"Costs will continue to skyrocket until we realize what is driving up health care costs is costly diversions such as defensive medicine.
"
2446,L,"While Democrats and Republicans continually debate the intricacies of the ACA, the current health care law will not reduce health care costs. Instead, a proposal now before legislators in four states to eliminate defensive medicine would do what the ACA failed to.
"
2447,L,"The legislation in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Montana is known as a Patients' Compensation System would replace medical malpractice with a no-blame, administrative model similar to workers compensation.
"
2448,L,"Workers compensation keeps most workplace injuries from turning into a court case between employer and employee. Likewise under a PCS, physicians would not be sued as claims would be filed before a panel of health care experts to determine if a medical injury occurred. If so, then patients would receive fair and consistent compensation for their injuries in an expedient manner.
"
2449,L,"Physicians would not be held personally liable or blamed, thus they would stop practicing defensive medicine. Instead of hefty medical malpractice premiums, doctors would drop malpractice coverage and pay a greatly-reduced fee into a state-managed system to cover any losses they might incur under the no-blame system.
"
2450,L,"The cost savings are derived from the elimination of lengthy litigation costs. The injury dollars would go to patients, not lawyers.
"
2451,L,"The elimination of defensive medicine would also be good for patients. Under our current medical malpractice system, doctors rarely admit their mistakes as it is too costly to them personally. Under a no-blame, administrative system, physicians would be willing to not only stop practicing defensive medicine but would be willing to work on best practices after admitting mistakes. This model would increase patient safety.
"
2452,L,"Eliminating defensive medicine to reduce health care costs has gained the attention of Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Fred Upton, R-Mich. They announced plans to introduce comprehensive legislation as an alternative to the ACA with incentives for states to reduce defensive medicine by instituting a plan like the patients' compensation system.
"
2453,L,"With so many demands on our current health care model, there is no room for waste and unnecessary expense. If making health care affordable is the goal of health care reform, then let's put its primary driver at the top of the to-do list — eliminating defensive medicine.

""It is not about quarter-over-quarter changes in inventory and reported gross margins.""Q1 revenue at Intel's data center group, which reflects sales of server chips, rose 19% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $3.7 billion. Internet of Things Group revenue rose 11% to $533 million.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, Nomura, Pacific Crest Securities and Topeka Capital Markets boosted their price targets on Intel stock Wednesday, but Cowen & Co. lowered its price target.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, the No. 1 chipmaker and long the dominant supplier of processor chips for PCs, reported Q1 earnings per share excluding items of 41 cents, up 8%. Revenue was flat at $12.8 billion, in line with Intel's lowered revenue forecast. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of 41 cents on $12.9 billion in revenue.The chipmaker's Q2 revenue forecast also fell below views. Intel forecast $12.7 billion to $13.7 billion in revenue, with the midpoint below the analyst model for $13.5 billion.Still, Intel stock was up 4.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 33. Intel stock is down 9% this year.Data Center, IoT HighlightedIntel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a conference call with analysts late Tuesday that management is ""confident in its strategy to drive growth.""""We're focused on innovating in our client business, improving mobile profitability and investing in and growing profitable adjacent markets,"" Krzanich said. ""We are applying our process technology leadership, silicon integration expertise and the efficient use of shared intellectual property. This strategy is delivering results as evidenced by the growth we saw this quarter (Q1) in the Data Center, IoT and Nand (flash memory) segments.""Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay, in a research report Wednesday, raised his target price to 39 from 38, noting ""continued strong data center, IoT and Nand momentum.""""We continue to believe Intel has strong core fundamentals driven by sustained foundry advantages and strong secular momentum supporting 15-plus percent Data Center Group and 20% IoT Group growth potential,"" Ramsay said. ""While mobile losses remain heavy, we believe Intel's modem/system-on-chip technology is gradually closing the gap in a quickly thinning herd of competitors.""Krzanich also said ""challenging macroeconomic conditions and an appreciating U.S. dollar weighed on our business"" in Q1 and that its newly formed Client Computing Group results ""reflected weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC supply-chain inventories.""Krzanich declined to speculate on ""rumors"" when asked by analysts about acquisition plans, referring to recent news reports that Intel has been in talks to buy programmable chipmaker Altera (ALTR). Altera stock was up 2.5% in afternoon trading Wednesday, near 43.Improving Profit MarginsPacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell in a research report Wednesday boosted Intel's price target to 37 from 35 and maintained an overweight rating, saying Intel's strong data center group results ""buoys its gross margin.""Intel's closely watched gross profit margin was 60.5% in Q1, down from 65.4% in Q4 but up from 59.6% in the year-earlier quarter. Intel expects its gross profit to improve to 62% in Q2, ""plus or minus a couple of percentage points,"" citing higher selling prices and lower production costs.FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland in a research note Wednesday said Intel's full-year revenue guidance (flat vs. last year's $55.87 billion) ""was slightly better than feared.""He said ""the massive reduction in 2015 capital expenditures was a positive highlight as the bears' argument against increasing capital intensity should subside.""Intel said it would cut $1.3 billion from 2015 capital expenditures to $8.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Yet, shares of chip equipment makers Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC)and Lam Research (LRCX) were all up at least 1% in afternoon trading Wednesday.Summit Research Partners analyst Srini Sundararajan said in a research note Wednesday that while it may seem ""counterintuitive,"" Intel's lower capital expenditures could actually work in the semiconductor equipment company's favor because ""most spending is likely on higher margin, higher revenue-per-unit"" products.Intel for the first time in Q1 combined results from its money-losing Mobile and Communications Group with its profitable PC Client Group by forming the new Client Computer Group, which now includes sales from PC microprocessors and chips for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Client Computer Group sales fell 8% to $7.4 billion.Intel forecast full-year revenue as flat with last year's $55.87 billion, which is a touch higher than the current consensus for $55.65 billion. Gross profit is expected to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of percentage points.Cowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri on Wednesday lowered his price target on Intel to 33 from 37 but reiterated a market perform rating.""Intel's full-year guidance was not unexpected, but also requires 2015 to be the most second-half loaded year since the 2009 recovery — a factor which raises some eyebrows given ongoing questions around PC demand and mix shift to low-end given the U.S. dollar's strength,"" Arcuri said.RELATED:SanDisk Q1 Likely To Be In Line With Preannouncement.

2517,L,"Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.
"
2518,L,"He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.
"
2519,L,"And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.
"
2520,L,"That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.
"
2521,L,"Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.
"
2522,L,"IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?
"
2523,L,"Weiss: Yes.
"
2524,L,"IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?
"
2525,L,"Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.
"
2526,L,"IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?
"
2527,L,"Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.
"
2528,L,"IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.
"
2529,L,"Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).
"
2530,L,"IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?
"
2531,L,"Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.
"
2532,L,"The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.
"
2533,L,"IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?
"
2534,L,"Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.
"
2535,L,"IBD: Such as?
"
2536,L,"Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.
"
2537,L,"So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.
"
2538,L,"IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.
"
2539,L,"Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.
"
2540,L,"We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.
"
2541,L,"U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.
"
2542,L,"IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?
"
2543,L,"Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.
"
2544,L,"IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?
"
2545,L,"Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.
"
2546,L,"The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.
"
2547,L,"IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?
"
2548,L,"Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.
"
2549,L,"Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.
"
2550,L,"IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?
"
2551,L,"Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.
"
2552,L,"IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?
"
2553,L,"Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.
"
2554,L,"IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?
"
2555,L,"Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.
"
2556,L,"IBD: Why is that?
"
2557,L,"Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.
"
2558,L,"China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.
"
2559,L,"From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.
"
2560,L,"We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.
"
2561,L,"IBD: What about Peru, please?
"
2562,L,"WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.
"
2563,L,"It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.
"
2564,L,"IBD: What do you like in Turkey?
"
2565,L,"Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.
"
2566,L,"Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.
"
2567,L,"IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?
"
2568,L,"Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.
"
2569,L,"In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).
"
2570,L,"Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.
"
2571,L,"IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?
"
2572,L,"Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.
"
2573,L,"The intensifying competition among smartphone and other electronics OEMs is resulting in increasing demand for leading edge semiconductor content. This benefits (Dutch based) ASML Holding (ASML), the largest provider of lithography equipment.
"
2574,L,"The rising use of e-commerce and the shift to mobile usage is benefiting Alibaba and Japan's Rakuten (which runs the large Ichiba e-commerce site).
"
2575,L,"The increased use of social media applications, particularly in China, is helping stocks like TenCent.
"
2576,L,"And the accelerating trend of advertising dollars shifting from traditional media to digital benefits stocks like Baidu (BIDU), the GoogleGOOGL of China.
"
2577,L,"IBD: What other sectors?
"
2578,L,"Weiss: In health care, more efficient spending on R&D, combined with benefits of mapping the human genome, is resulting in accelerating new product launches, driving improved revenue growth for the pharmaceuticals industry.

2579,L,"Fred Maytag knew that he would have to overcome resistance to using his new washing machines.
"
2580,L,"Many people sent out clothing to be professionally cleaned, since no devices were around to make cleaning easy to do at home.
"
2581,L,"Convincing them to do their own laundry again wouldn't be easy.
"
2582,L,"But Maytag had overcome many setbacks to pioneer safer farm machinery. He knew how to make new technology user-friendly.
"
2583,L,"""When quality issues arose in his farm equipment, Maytag was determined to stand behind his products, spending hours in countless fields and barns fixing the issues,"" Kristine Vernier, spokeswoman for Whirlpool (WHR), which owns the Maytag brand, told IBD.
"
2584,L,"""He was determined to make every product dependable. 'Along with leadership comes the confidence of the public,' he said. 'We must maintain the quality of our product in every aspect.' Soon after, he grew his business into making reliable major home appliances, taking care to instill a heritage of great component parts and, as he said, 'outstanding quality, second to none.'""
"
2585,L,"Frederick Louis ""F.L."" Maytag (1857-1937) was born on a farm in Cook County, Ill., the first of 10 children of German Jewish immigrant parents.
"
2586,L,"On The Go
"
2587,L,"Several years later, they moved to Clay County. The farm was sold for a good profit in 1865, when they settled in Mattoon, Ill.
"
2588,L,"Fred, 8, began delivering groceries for the family store there, but a year later they accepted a good offer to buy a farm near Newton, Iowa, their last move.
"
2589,L,"""His father was often away working as a mechanic for other farmers, and Fred was left to keep things going,"" wrote A.B. Funk in ""Fred L. Maytag: A Biography."" ""Before he was 10, he had plowed 80 acres of prairie sod with a plow that weighed 200 pounds and whose handles were as tall as he was. It was a real man's job.""
"
2590,L,"Maytag was curious about all kinds of equipment. In 1880, an implement dealer noted the young man's mechanical fascination and offered him $50 (worth $1,200 now) a month to be a salesman.
"
2591,L,"At the end of the next year, one of the partners sold his half-share for the $800 (worth $19,000 now) that Maytag had saved and a new firm, Maytag & Bergman, was formed.
"
2592,L,"It was successful for the next eight years, after which Maytag sold his half to his partner and, by then, brother-in-law, William Bergman. Maytag had married Bergman's sister, Dena, in 1882, and they would have two sons and two daughters.
"
2593,L,"In 1893, after owning a lumber business for a few years, Maytag, 36, was back investing with William; another brother-in-law, A.H. Bergman; and inventor George Parsons. They formed Parsons Band-Cutter & Self Feeder in Newton.
"
2594,L,"Amid a rash of threshing-machine injuries, the plan was to produce improved farm implements. Maytag and his partners answered the call with a device that fed straw into the threshing cylinder in a safer way.
"
2595,L,"In 1905, they introduced a husker shredder to process corn mechanically, and it became popular.
"
2596,L,"""But there were numerous customer complaints about product quality,"" said David Sturt, author of ""Great Work: How to Make a Difference People Love"" and executive vice president at the O.C. Tanner Institute, which advises companies on employee recognition programs. ""Maytag found there were the fewest problems in Minnesota, where a mechanic, Howard Snyder, was doing a good job of fixing the company's products. Maytag brought him to headquarters to improve their equipment design, and in 1909 Maytag bought out his partners to create the Maytag Company (also in Newton). From then on, he could take full responsibility, staking his reputation on the quality of the products and the service.""
"
2597,L,"From 1907 to 1912, Maytag made personal investments in firms that were manufacturing other products, including vacuum cleaners, cars and fountain pens.
"
2598,L,"He lost his shirt but took responsibility for friends who had invested their own money based on his judgment, reimbursing them.
"
2599,L,"Next up for Maytag was innovation in the washing of clothes, sheets and linen.
"
2600,L,"""Laundering clothes was one of the most labor-intensive tasks of daily American life,"" said Bernard Carlson, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Understanding the Inventions That Changed the World."" ""Clothes were washed primarily by women by scrubbing against a rock until the washboard was invented in 1797. Inventors had long tried to make a machine to do the rubbing, but by 1900 most families sent clothes and bedding out to commercial laundries that could use big steam engines. To convince housewives to bring the service back home, early washing machine makers had to come up with a way to automate and simplify the entire process — filling the tub, agitating the clothes, rinsing and wringing out the excess water.""
"
2601,L,"Finding A Way
"
2602,L,"In 1907 Maytag brought out his first washing machine, the Pastime, which used a corrugated wooden tub. A hand crank pulled a dolly that pulled clothes through the washer and along the walls of the tub for the cleaning action.
"
2603,L,"A pulley could be attached so that a windmill or tractor could power the machine.
"
2604,L,"In 1911, an electrical motor was offered as a power source.
"
2605,L,"Four years later, a gasoline motor version could be used in rural areas without electricity.
"
2606,L,"Maytag was finding his calling.
"
2607,L,"By 1919, his company had replaced the wooden tub with an aluminum one. Three years later came the Gyrafoam washer, which used a vaned agitator on the bottom of the tub to force soapy water through the clothes rather than rubbing them.
"
2608,L,"""The persistence at improving quality paid off,"" said Sturt. ""Sales increased from $2 million in 1921 to $53 million in 1926. By 1923, Maytag had phased out all his other equipment to focus on what became the world's largest washing machine plant in Newton.
"
2609,L,"""Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone said they recognized that his entrepreneurial success was due to the attention to consumer needs and expectations that had been the basis of their own.""
"
2610,L,"In 1920, L.B. Maytag, one of the founder's sons, took over day-to-day operations as president, with his father continuing as chairman to provide advice and zeroing in on philanthropy and state politics.
"
2611,L,"Solid Market
"
2612,L,"By 1924, Maytag was making 20% of all washing machines in America.
"
2613,L,"The next year, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the other son, Elmer, becoming president in 1926.
"
2614,L,"By then, Americans were buying 900,000 semiautomated washers a year from all manufacturers at an average price of $150, or $2,000 in today's money.
"
2615,L,"By 1935, the price had dropped to $60, leading to 1.4 million sold by all companies, says Carlson.
"
2616,L,"In the 1930s, Maytag engineers eliminated the wringer for drying clothes. He introduced a motor and a perforated basket that spun clothes at high speed to eliminate excess water.
"
2617,L,"A timer and electromechanical controls were also added.
"
2618,L,"Maytag built loyalty by taking care of his workers. He built hundreds of low-cost houses that he sold to them on easy terms. On his 75th birthday in 1932, he distributed $150,000 to his 1,500 employees (worth $1,700 per person today).
"
2619,L,"Maytag died at age 79. People came from all over America by train to the funeral in Newton, and 10,000 formed a line five blocks long for the casket processional. Maytag's estate was assessed at $10 million (worth $162 million today).

2620,L,"By the 21st century, the Maytag company had sold over 40 million appliances. Whirlpool bought it in 2006 and has enjoyed an 890% stock run since 2009.Fred Maytag knew that he would have to overcome resistance to using his new washing machines.Many people sent out clothing to be professionally cleaned, since no devices were around to make cleaning easy to do at home.Convincing them to do their own laundry again wouldn't be easy.But Maytag had overcome many setbacks to pioneer safer farm machinery. He knew how to make new technology user-friendly.""When quality issues arose in his farm equipment, Maytag was determined to stand behind his products, spending hours in countless fields and barns fixing the issues,"" Kristine Vernier, spokeswoman for Whirlpool (WHR), which owns the Maytag brand, told IBD.""He was determined to make every product dependable. 'Along with leadership comes the confidence of the public,' he said. 'We must maintain the quality of our product in every aspect.' Soon after, he grew his business into making reliable major home appliances, taking care to instill a heritage of great component parts and, as he said, 'outstanding quality, second to none.'""Frederick Louis ""F.L."" Maytag (1857-1937) was born on a farm in Cook County, Ill., the first of 10 children of German Jewish immigrant parents.On The GoSeveral years later, they moved to Clay County. The farm was sold for a good profit in 1865, when they settled in Mattoon, Ill.Fred, 8, began delivering groceries for the family store there, but a year later they accepted a good offer to buy a farm near Newton, Iowa, their last move.""His father was often away working as a mechanic for other farmers, and Fred was left to keep things going,"" wrote A.B. Funk in ""Fred L. Maytag: A Biography."" ""Before he was 10, he had plowed 80 acres of prairie sod with a plow that weighed 200 pounds and whose handles were as tall as he was. It was a real man's job.""Maytag was curious about all kinds of equipment. In 1880, an implement dealer noted the young man's mechanical fascination and offered him $50 (worth $1,200 now) a month to be a salesman.At the end of the next year, one of the partners sold his half-share for the $800 (worth $19,000 now) that Maytag had saved and a new firm, Maytag & Bergman, was formed.It was successful for the next eight years, after which Maytag sold his half to his partner and, by then, brother-in-law, William Bergman. Maytag had married Bergman's sister, Dena, in 1882, and they would have two sons and two daughters.In 1893, after owning a lumber business for a few years, Maytag, 36, was back investing with William; another brother-in-law, A.H. Bergman; and inventor George Parsons. They formed Parsons Band-Cutter & Self Feeder in Newton.Amid a rash of threshing-machine injuries, the plan was to produce improved farm implements. Maytag and his partners answered the call with a device that fed straw into the threshing cylinder in a safer way.In 1905, they introduced a husker shredder to process corn mechanically, and it became popular.""But there were numerous customer complaints about product quality,"" said David Sturt, author of ""Great Work: How to Make a Difference People Love"" and executive vice president at the O.C. Tanner Institute, which advises companies on employee recognition programs. ""Maytag found there were the fewest problems in Minnesota, where a mechanic, Howard Snyder, was doing a good job of fixing the company's products. Maytag brought him to headquarters to improve their equipment design, and in 1909 Maytag bought out his partners to create the Maytag Company (also in Newton). From then on, he could take full responsibility, staking his reputation on the quality of the products and the service.""From 1907 to 1912, Maytag made personal investments in firms that were manufacturing other products, including vacuum cleaners, cars and fountain pens.He lost his shirt but took responsibility for friends who had invested their own money based on his judgment, reimbursing them.Next up for Maytag was innovation in the washing of clothes, sheets and linen.""Laundering clothes was one of the most labor-intensive tasks of daily American life,"" said Bernard Carlson, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Understanding the Inventions That Changed the World."" ""Clothes were washed primarily by women by scrubbing against a rock until the washboard was invented in 1797. Inventors had long tried to make a machine to do the rubbing, but by 1900 most families sent clothes and bedding out to commercial laundries that could use big steam engines. To convince housewives to bring the service back home, early washing machine makers had to come up with a way to automate and simplify the entire process — filling the tub, agitating the clothes, rinsing and wringing out the excess water.""Finding A WayIn 1907 Maytag brought out his first washing machine, the Pastime, which used a corrugated wooden tub. A hand crank pulled a dolly that pulled clothes through the washer and along the walls of the tub for the cleaning action.A pulley could be attached so that a windmill or tractor could power the machine.In 1911, an electrical motor was offered as a power source.Four years later, a gasoline motor version could be used in rural areas without electricity.Maytag was finding his calling.By 1919, his company had replaced the wooden tub with an aluminum one. Three years later came the Gyrafoam washer, which used a vaned agitator on the bottom of the tub to force soapy water through the clothes rather than rubbing them.""The persistence at improving quality paid off,"" said Sturt. ""Sales increased from $2 million in 1921 to $53 million in 1926. By 1923, Maytag had phased out all his other equipment to focus on what became the world's largest washing machine plant in Newton.""Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone said they recognized that his entrepreneurial success was due to the attention to consumer needs and expectations that had been the basis of their own.""In 1920, L.B. Maytag, one of the founder's sons, took over day-to-day operations as president, with his father continuing as chairman to provide advice and zeroing in on philanthropy and state politics.Solid MarketBy 1924, Maytag was making 20% of all washing machines in America.The next year, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the other son, Elmer, becoming president in 1926.By then, Americans were buying 900,000 semiautomated washers a year from all manufacturers at an average price of $150, or $2,000 in today's money.By 1935, the price had dropped to $60, leading to 1.4 million sold by all companies, says Carlson.In the 1930s, Maytag engineers eliminated the wringer for drying clothes. He introduced a motor and a perforated basket that spun clothes at high speed to eliminate excess water.A timer and electromechanical controls were also added.Maytag built loyalty by taking care of his workers. He built hundreds of low-cost houses that he sold to them on easy terms. On his 75th birthday in 1932, he distributed $150,000 to his 1,500 employees (worth $1,700 per person today).Maytag died at age 79. People came from all over America by train to the funeral in Newton, and 10,000 formed a line five blocks long for the casket processional. Maytag's estate was assessed at $10 million (worth $162 million today).By the 21st century, the Maytag company had sold over 40 million appliances. Whirlpool bought it in 2006 and has enjoyed an 890% stock run since 2009.

2623,L,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
2624,L,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
2625,L,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
2626,L,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
2627,L,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
2628,L,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
2629,L,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
2630,L,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
2631,L,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
2632,L,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
2633,L,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
2634,L,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
2635,L,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
2636,L,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
2637,L,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
2638,L,"April Outlook
"
2639,L,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
2640,L,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
2641,L,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
2642,L,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

2643,L,"Old Navy Nails Sales
"
2644,L,"Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.
"
2645,L,"The gain was led by its Old Navy brand, which saw a 14% rise in the month's same-store sales.

2652,L,"'Dismal' Retail Economics
"
2653,L,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
2654,L,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""
"
2655,L,"Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.
"
2656,L,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
2657,L,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
2658,L,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
2659,L,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
2660,L,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
2661,L,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
2662,L,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
2663,L,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
2664,L,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""
"

2678,L,"Attracting first-time homebuyers might seem like courting a herd of underfed cats.Squeezed by tight credit, student debt and low wages, they're still the missing link to a robust housing recovery.But not for LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), a small homebuilder based near Houston. It sends 12,000 pieces of direct mail ""every single week"" to renters in complexes within 25 miles of one of its active communities, says CEO Eric Lipar.With homes selling for under $200,000 — the average in the past quarter was $166,000 — first-time buyers are the company's prime customers.They've been flocking to its communities, some 38 at last count, including markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Colorado.About 95% of LGI buyers are renters. Their interest ""is triggered by getting a rental-notice increase,"" Lipar told IBD. ""Rising rents work to our advantage for sure.""LGI, which went public a year ago, closed sale on 2,110 homes through the end of November compared with 1,617 for all of 2013.""When a lot of builders were getting out of entry-level, we stuck with it, and we've always been profitable,"" Lipar said. ""Our plan is to stick with first-time buyers.""The company may see busier days, as could other builders aiming at first-timers, such as large-cap builder D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), with its low-priced Express Homes.At a little over 30% of the overall homebuying market, the share of first-time buyers in 2014 hit its lowest point in nearly 30 years, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).Homes Easier To Afford?Affordability is still an issue, but early signs are emerging of a better climate for first-time buyers, including an improving job market.For the three months ended in November, employment in America grew 2% year over year, the strongest rate since the first quarter of 2006. And the key first-time-buyer cohort — the missing 25- to 29-year-olds — showed a 3% gain.Though new jobs ""are not as high-paying as in the past, it's still acceleration,"" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist with property researcher CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX). ""So it should foreshadow an increase in demand for first-time buyers.""A second reason may also help: Institutional investors are leaving the market. That means ""less competition for starter homes,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR.Investors paying all cash for starter homes had bid up prices, shutting out many first-time buyers. But price gains are decelerating.The latest S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show a slight drop in the 10- and 20-city composites in October vs. September. They still were up 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively, from a year earlier.""I call it a more organic market, less influenced by distressed sales and artificial support from quantitative easing"" by the Feds, Khater said. He added that ""2015 will really be the first year (in many) that both volumes and price movements will reflect fundamentals — meaning supply, demand and income.""That shift is ""beginning to be reflected in home prices,"" he said.Markets On The MoveKhater notes that many markets with the biggest price gains in 2014 had the strongest underlying economies, based especially on technology and energy industries.Pricey San Francisco, a leading tech center, showed the biggest monthly gain of all 20 cities in Case-Shiller's latest survey, at nearly 1% in October over September.Khater points out that lower-priced homes are seeing faster growth than higher-end homes in the top 25 U.S. housing markets, reflecting tight supply and a lack of new construction for single-family starter homes.Some markets, such as those in the Carolinas and Texas, are seeing robust construction and sales trends, he says.Falling oil prices may make energy-capital Houston — one of the country's hottest home markets recently — and other Texas markets ""vulnerable"" to a slowdown in new oil-related jobs in 2015, says the NAR's Yun.Still, the Lone Star State is diversified, ""so it may be able to withstand the potential decline because other sectors of the economy continue to show strength,"" he said. Also, Texas has more affordable homes relative to many other housing markets around the nation.Jobs And Sun Belt MigrationYun sees housing demand growing in Rocky Mountain states such as Colorado and Utah, thanks to strong job growth.Meanwhile, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are benefiting from corporate relocations as well as retirees moving in.""I see opportunities on two ends,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.""The entry-level buyer will come back, though more slowly than most people think,"" he said. ""And the older buyer — the retiree — is already back and buying homes, a lot of them paying all cash.""Today's generation of first-time buyers are older than their predecessors because they have delayed marriage and having children, Burns says.""The ultimate impetus (for buying a first home) is when you need to put a child into a school. We're seeing more of those buyers,"" he said.Still waiting to make their move are many buyers who bought entry-level homes in the early 2000s and saw their homes plummet in value during the housing downturn. Now largely in their early 40s, they don't have enough equity to move, Burns says.He expects that older baby boomers will continue to support the housing market in 2015 and beyond as they sell their homes at a profit and then use the cash to buy other homes.""We're seeing active-adult communities pop up all over the country,"" Burns said. ""They're doing great.""Especially active on that front is homebuilder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), with its Del Webb Communities.In a report this week, analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee said he prefers builders ""who concentrate on older, move-up buyers bringing equity from their previous home to the closing table.""His top picks among that group are PulteGroup, WCI Communities (NYSE:WCIC) and Ryland Group (NYSE:RYL).New low-down-payment programs from Fannie Mae (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCBB:FMCC) may spur healthy order growth for eligible first-time buyers in 2015, he noted, ""if originators take the bait.""He expects the lack of mortgage availability for first-time and subprime buyers to continue into 2015 ""because we do not believe banks are being compensated for the tail risk on mortgages.""Still, slower price appreciation opens up opportunities for potential new homebuyers after months and years of robust price gains ""acted to squeeze out new buyers,"" noted Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Sterne Agee, in a report this week.""Slower price gains and still historically low interest rates (around 4%) may work to encourage new demand in 2015,"" she wrote.Housing watchers don't expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates much, if at all, in the near term, perhaps not until mid-2015 at the earliest.Meanwhile, CEO Lipar of LGI Homes is counting on more first-time buyers to come his way as they ""save more and work on their credit scores.""""Demand will always be there from people who rent,"" he said.

2679,L," Reform: To many in the West, Islam seems mired in a pre-medieval mindset that makes it unable to reconcile the fundamental precepts of its faith with those of the modern world. But there are encouraging signs of change.In what Roger L. Simon rightly called ""an extraordinary"" New Year's speech that got virtually no attention in the West, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued a sweeping, no-holdsbarred critique of Islam — and suggested it needs major reform.""It's inconceivable,"" said al-Sisi, as translated by Raymond Ibrahim's blog, ""that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire umma (Islamic world) to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world.""“Is it possible,” he asked, “that 1.6 billion (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world’s inhabitants — that is 7 billion — so that they themselves may live?” Islam needs a “religious revolution,” he concluded. Three things are notable in this remarkable speech. One, al-Sisi is the leader of Egypt, the most populous Arab Islamic nation, with 5% of the world’s Muslims. His speech will have a major impact.Two, it comes in the wake of the failed “Arab Spring” and the subsequent takeover of a wide swath of the Mideast by the fundamentalist Islamic State and its allies. It suggests there’s a growing revulsion at being associated with the beheaders, rapists and torturers who operate under the flag of fundamentalist Islam.As the British Guardian newspaper notes, “spiraling instability across much of the Arab world” has led to 16.7 million Arab refugees, an unprcedented human tide of misery. These are not happy people, and many will rightly blame their suffering on the Muslim extremists and terrorists who’ve driven them out.Three, al-Sisi pointedly made his comments at Al-Azhar — the same Cairo mosque/university that gave birth to the Muslim Brotherhood, and where President Obama in 2009 made a cringe-inducing apology to the Muslim world. The contrast couldn’t be sharper.Nor is al-Sisi alone. Bridget Johnson of the PJ Tatler quotes influential Sheikh Ahmad al-Ghamdi, the former head of Saudi Arabia's religious police at the holy site of Mecca, as saying women shouldn't have to wear the veil and should be able to mix with men, wear makeup and travel to foreign countries without being accompanied by a male.Such a statement may seem insignificant in the liberated West, but in a country like Saudi Arabia the very idea that women can have their own identity apart from husbands or fathers is, well, revolutionary.Islam has often been likened to medieval Christianity before the Reformation. Whether that's true or not, even this inkling of an Islamic Reformation should be much welcomed.

2682,L,"John L. Sullivan became the first modern heavyweight boxing champion by punching hard.And he pushed just as hard to improve the sport.""When Sullivan entered the ring in the 1870s, prizefights were savage, bare-knuckled affairs, outlawed all across the country,"" Christopher Klein, author of ""Strong Boy: The Life and Times of John L. Sullivan, America's First Sports Hero,"" told IBD. ""By force of personality and his championing of gloved fighting under rules that limited the brutality and the rounds, he delivered the sport from the backwoods to the front pages. He was able to kick-start boxing popularity, sell out venues such as Madison Square Garden repeatedly and earn a fortune.""Sullivan learned to leverage his celebrity into income from a wide variety of sources such as product endorsements and starring in plays, bringing in an estimated lifetime income of $1 million (worth over $26 million today).Sullivan (1858-1918) was born in Boston to Irish immigrants.His father stood just 5 foot 3 and weighed less than 130 pounds, so John probably inherited his strength from his mother, who tipped the scales at 180.At 19, at a healthy 5-10 and 200 pounds, Sullivan stepped on stage at a variety show for his first bout. He promptly knocked his opponent into the orchestra. He didn't take formal boxing lessons but observed what others did and soon was nicknamed Strong Boy.Smash Hit""Sullivan found prizefighting a perfect complement for his natural athleticism and aggressive disposition,"" said Springs Toledo, author of the boxing essay collection ""The Gods of War."" ""He never looked back, with a style that was all action and enabled him to chase seasoned veterans out of the ring before he was 20. That increased his confidence, which propelled him toward more conquests.""His willingness to move forward, challenging anyone who would fight despite rather extreme risks, paid off big time in many ways, some unexpected.""Boxing in ancient times came without gloves. The London Prize Ring Rules were introduced in 1838 to regulate competition for money and titles, though the rules still allowed wrestling, eye gouging and kicking, and bouts could last hours.U.S. legislation banning prizefighting and bare-knuckle brawls started in the 1840s. In 1867, England's Marquess of Queensberry proposed changes that required gloves, banned nonboxing moves and limited the rounds.""Sullivan felt that bare-knuckle boxing was not very fan-friendly, since fights had to take place in secret and secluded locations far from police intervention,"" said Klein. ""Purses for the illegal bouts also failed to provide living wages for even the titleholders.""In 1881, Sullivan made his first boxing appearance in New York City, routing his opponent and becoming an overnight sensation.However, facing the publisher of the National Police Gazette, Richard Fox — a boxing kingmaker who wanted to back him against bare-knuckle heavyweight champ Paddy Ryan — Sullivan argued about the details of the proposed match.A furious Fox switched to Ryan and would search the world for boxers to fight Sullivan.Reps for Sullivan and Ryan signed an agreement, and the men trained for months.They finally met in February 1882 in Mississippi City, Miss., a last-minute choice to avoid arrest, as threatened by the governor.More than 2,000 watched the challenger deliver the knockout blow in the ninth round, making him the new heavyweight champ. The telegraphed news electrified the nation, especially Irish Americans, who had few heroes until Sullivan.The issue of the National Police Gazette bellowing Sullivan's triumph sold 300,000 copies, twice its normal run. Sullivan used the star opportunity to make boxing more attractive to the middle and upper classes by insisting on the Queensberry Rules at his official matches, as well as exhibition sparring at benefits, testimonials and variety shows.In 1883, he married a widow, Annie Bailey, and bought a home in Boston. She would bear a son the next year while he was on tour.""Sullivan came along just as the American publicity machine was beginning to crank, and he knew how to pull all the levers,"" said Klein. ""He rarely turned down a request for an interview, he was good copy and possessed a showman's flair worthy of his contemporary, P.T. Barnum.""His greatest stroke of genius was to put on an eight-month, coast-to-coast tour to 136 locations in 1883 and 1884, challenging anyone to get into the ring with him and stay on his feet more than 12 minutes, offering up to $1,000, which would be like $25,000 today. He was not only bringing the sport to the masses; he was letting the masses get in the ring with him!""The EntertainerHe found ways to make more beyond the ring. ""He realized that the growing fascination with celebrity that took root in the Gilded Age would allow him to charge money just to see him in the flesh,"" said Klein. ""He made far more money outside the ring than inside it by headlining theatrical productions, pitching in exhibition baseball games and even touring the country in a living statuary show where he donned himself with white powder and mimicked the poses of Greek and Roman statues.""Annie filed for divorce in 1885, taking their son to Rhode Island to move in with relatives. John Jr. died the next year, but Dad did not attend the funeral.Sullivan sailed for England, Scotland and Ireland in 1887 to do a boxing tour. He held a private contest for the friends of the prince of Wales, who would become King Edward VII in 1901.In November, Sullivan took a side trip to defend his title before a small group of bettors at a secret outdoor location near Paris.The challenger was Charley Mitchell, whom he had beaten before, but Mitchell's cleats accidentally spiked Sullivan's foot, and later the champ broke his right arm hitting Mitchell's elbow in an unusual accident. In the 14th round, with rain pouring, they wrestled in mud until finally, after three hours, the bout was declared a draw. So Sullivan, broken but hardly bowed, kept the title.The Final RoundsBack in America, he was challenged by bare-knuckle brawler Jake Kilrain. They agreed to a fight in July 1889 and went into training.Prizefighting was illegal in all states, but 3,000 fans ignored the law and showed up in Richburg, Miss., while promoters stayed a step ahead of the cops. The battle lasted 75 rounds and more than two hours, with Sullivan the victor in the last heavyweight championship under the London Rules.He had to pay $18,000 to stay out of jail but made $100,000 over the next two years as a star of melodramas on stage.His next title defense, against Gentleman Jim Corbett, came in September 1892 in New Orleans under the Queensberry Rules with gloves, the first modern heavyweight championship.By now, prizefighting had become more respectable and legal in many places. The Corbett bout had a winner-take-all $25,000 purse, the largest ever, plus $10,000 that each side's backers bet for a total in today's value of $1.2 million.Sullivan started training in June and looked out of shape for the bout. Corbett danced around out of reach to wear out the champ, while hitting hard when he could.In the 21st round, Sullivan was felled and stayed down for the count for the first time in his career. It was ""the most sensational single episode in the history of American sport,"" legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice would opine four decades later.Sullivan was through with official fights, ending with 40 wins, 34 by knockout, two draws and two no contests (when police intervened). He was in the ring an estimated 450 times, counting all amateur bouts and sparring for entertainment.For the rest of his life, until his death at 59, Sullivan made his income from exhibition bouts in the U.S., starring in plays and giving lectures about his colorful life.

At least 30 foreign firms, including San Diego-based Qualcomm, have come under the scrutiny of China's 2008 anti-monopoly law, the report said.""We see the U.S. government's involvement as a positive, as an unfavorable ruling could potentially damage international relations, in addition to its impact on Qualcomm,"" Long said.He speculates Qualcomm could aid Xiaomi, which is a customer, in its legal battle in India through a cross-licensing deal with Ericsson.Qualcomm stock was up 1% in early trading in the stock market today.RELATED:Qualcomm Invests In Chinese Startups.

2742,L,"Crime: By rolling the red carpet out for black ""leader"" Al Sharpton, President Obama spits in the eye of every police officer — white, black or whatever. A federal war on police begins.Scholar Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal charges that ""President Obama betrayed the nation"" and ""perverted his role as the leader of all Americans and as the country's most visible symbol of the primacy of the law"" in his comments after a grand jury found no evidence of wrongdoing by white police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of black suspect Michael Brown.""The testimony of a half-dozen black observers at the scene demolished the early incendiary reports that Wilson attacked Brown in cold blood and shot Brown in his back when his hands were up,"" MacDonald noted, with witnesses claiming brutality by Wilson exposed as inconsistent and finding themselves ""contradicted by the physical evidence and by other witnesses, who corroborated Wilson's testimony that Brown had attacked him and had tried to grab his gun.""Obama should have praised the grand jury's conclusion, coming after a thorough examination of all the evidence, and affirmed the integrity of America's criminal justice system.  But like the violent, looting protesters in Ferguson, Mo., our president is uninterested in the truth.No wonder a demagogue who personifies politicized lies like Al Sharpton is welcomed into the White House — not by any means for the first time — to advise Obama.Too many have forgotten who Sharpton is.  He came to fame peddling the elaborate Tawana Brawley hoax in upstate New York in 1987, in which a black teen fabricated the claim she was gang-raped by a white policeman, a local white prosecutor and four other white men, her clothes torn and burned, her body smeared with excrement, and ""KKK"" and the N-word and ""bitch"" written on her torso with a a charcoal-like substance.After a grand jury spent seven months confirming it was all a lie, Sharpton and Brawley were successfully sued for slander to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.Sharpton has never been elected dog catcher anywhere. But according to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" he is ""a trusted White House adviser who has become the president's go-to black leader, campaigning around the country for President Obama and his agenda.""  Obama has called him ""the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.""In August, the IBD/TIPP Poll found 64% of the public with an unfavorable opinion of Sharpton; only 29% had a favorable view.  A Zogby poll commissioned last year by Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L. Johnson found that while one in four blacks considered Sharpton to be their voice, significantly more — 40% of blacks — said no one speaks for them.Undoubtedly a great many of those black Americans are sick of self-promoting parasites like Sharpton who exist on black violence and economic misery.  Instead of exercising real leadership of their community — which would mean confronting the long-term epidemic of black-on-black crime whose casualties number in the thousands every year — Sharpton blames the cops who risk their lives saving countless black lives in high-crime neighborhoods.Now Obama reportedly plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to force police to wear video cameras on their persons and ""demilitarize"" law enforcement. In other words, further endangering our men and women in blue.A president who promised to unite America has found yet another way of dividing it.

2771,L,"Climate Change: With 18 years of no warming, you'd think the eco-agitators would admit they need to rethink their assumptions. Instead, they just double down on the nonsense.Not only is global warming not accelerating, it is, in the words of Cato analysts Paul C. Knappenberger and Patrick J. Michaels, ""actually decelerating, or, (nearly) stopped.""In fact, there is apparent 100% agreement among scientists that the planet isn't warming.Knappenberger and Michaels looked at 35 scientific papers published in recent years and ""every single one of them acknowledged in some way that a hiatus, pause, or slowdown in global warming was occurring.""They arrived at the figure using the same methodology that John Cook used to arrive at his famous claim that 97% of researchers endorsed the ""scientific consensus"" that man is causing Earth to warm.Their 100% claim, found on the Watts Up With That blog, was made with their tongues firmly lodged in their cheeks. But even if only one scientist truly believes that, the facts are still the facts, and they say there's been no warming in 18 years and one month.Truth doesn't persuade the professional scolds who can't give up the idea that man is heating the planet, though. It's almost as if they can't help themselves. They have to bedevil, badger and hector the ""deniers.""They lecture us at gas pumps, in Berkeley, Calif., where the city requires global warming warning labels and zoos.They screech at us when we worship, as in Maryland, where the government provides a break from its burdensome ""rain tax"" for churches that preach green. And they harangue us even on Alaskan cruises.And, of course, there are the polar bears. There will always be the polar bears. They make a handy bludgeon for the eco-radicals and climate change true believers to use on skeptics and agnostics, and they are always good for an emotional response from the public when reality is ruining the environmentalists' claims.As a symbol for a lost cause, there's nothing quite like the humble polar bear. It's long been the standard by which the global warming industry has tried to measure climate change. Indeed, just two weeks ago another report claimed polar bears are on their way out.""Polar bear population in frozen sea north of Alaska falls 40% in 10 years,"" screamed a Nov. 17 headline in the British Guardian.OK, we'll play along and introduce the research of John L. Casey, author of ""Cold Sun."" This one-time White House national space policy adviser and space shuttle engineer says the polar bears are part of a ""game being played upon us by AGW enthusiasts,"" because ""we just don't know how many polar bears there are!""What we do know, though, is the estimates don't corroborate the radical greens' story. ""The truth is that since the mid-1960s, when their population was estimated at about 10,000, polar bears now number well over 20,000,"" writes Casey.""Further, their numbers since 1972 have been in a relatively stable range of between 20,000 and 25,000, and that includes during the peak decades of the Earth's sun-caused global warming between the mid-1980s and the present.""Susan Crockford, a Canadian zoologist and professor who's been in her field for 35 years, says that any suggestion ""that polar bear populations have been declining is hugely misleading.""In addition, Anthony Watts of the Watts Up With That blog reminds us that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service reported ""earlier this year that 'the number of polar bears observed in 2012 was high relative to similar surveys conducted over the past decade.'""The eco-radicals and true believers get more desperate each year the climate change catastrophe they predicted doesn't come, and it causes them to make ever-more exaggerated declarations.They would save themselves a lot of embarrassment if they found a real problem to worry about.
"
2772,L,"From flat income growth to housing crash nightmares, potential first-time homebuyers possess plenty of reasons to shy from ownership, a trend that could aggravate weakening home price appreciation.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) early this month said that first-time homebuyers accounted for 33% of the market in its latest annual survey, a year-over-year drop of five percentage points and well below the long-term average of 40%.It's the lowest first-timer participation rate since 1987, and it coincides with the NAR's forecast that 4.9 million home sales in 2014 will fall 200,000 short of last year's total. Among impediments, the NAR and other observers say that student debt burdens and rising rents hinder the ability of young adults to save for a down payment.What's more, many young professionals are underemployed. Those who have landed jobs haven't enjoying the same wage growth as baby boomers and Generation X, says Stan Humphries, chief economist for Seattle-based online housing marketplace Zillow (Z).Those demand suppressors may require home sellers to dial back price expectations, particularly in the short term.""Assuming that income growth returns to normal, it won't have any long-term impact,"" said Humphries, referring to the dearth of first-time homebuyers. ""But right now we are having trouble getting income growth back to normal, and we can't have a functional economy or a functional housing market without it.""Paycheck DoldrumsPrivate-sector average hourly wages haven't increased more than about 2% annually the past few years, and growth in 2014 is on pace to continue the trend, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In addition to enduring miserly income expansion and other demand inhibitors, millennials are also avoiding marriage and baby rearing, which typically lead to home purchases, Humphries says.After increasing 19% from the trough in February 2012 to the end of 2013, home price appreciation across 20 major cities has been slowing for a large part of this year, according to the most recent S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.Average year-over-year appreciation of 5.5% in August was 110 basis points lower than the annual gain in July, according to the report. Moreover, price growth in August was just 0.2%, compared with 0.6% in July.""We've had a nice period of growth in home prices,"" said Daren Blomquist, a vice president of Irvine, Calif.-based RealtyTrac, a provider of housing data and analytics. ""But I think we're going into a period of stagnant price appreciation, and the only thing that could change that is if incomes went up.""Few ChoicesPart of the decelerating price increases can be traced to single-family home investors pulling back in the bellwether markets of Phoenix, Southern California and Atlanta, among others, Blomquist says.Aggressive investors primarily acquired entry-level homes and pushed up prices as much as 30% in some markets, he says. That in turn helped many ""underwater"" homeowners — those with more mortgage debt than the home is worth — return to positive equity.But ballooning price appreciation priced many entry-level buyers out of the market, adds Blomquist, who estimates that 8 million homeowners are still underwater, down from 13 million a couple of years ago.The still-large number of underwater homeowners is crimping supply, Humphries says, because a majority live in entry-level houses and can't sell them.""Even if buyers have navigated the demand issues — they have a decent job with a decent wage, and are married and having kids and want to buy a home,"" Humphries said, ""the number of homes available is dramatically less than it was pre-recession.""Low Down PaymentsBlomquist is skeptical about the effectiveness of a plan that Federal Housing Finance Agency head Mel Watt has introduced, which would allow Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) to purchase home loans that are made to ""lower-wealth borrowers"" who make a 3% down payment.The Federal Housing Administration already has a 3% down payment program, and Fannie and Freddie can now buy mortgages with as little as a 5% down payment, he says.A recent RealtyTrac study also found that, even with a 3% down payment, would-be buyers with a median income and an average student or car loan would be able to afford a monthly mortgage payment in only 48% of U.S. counties. Without debt, 92% of the counties would be affordable.""In my mind, the biggest thing weighing down first-time homebuyers right now is debt,"" Blomquist said.Homebuilders Stepping UpFederal agencies aren't alone in their efforts to stimulate home buying, however. Forth Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton (DHI) is rolling out its Express Homes division in the Southwest, Texas and the Southeast, focusing on attracting entry-level purchasers for homes priced around $150,000.Meanwhile, LGI Homes (LGIH), based in The Woodlands, Texas, is solely focused on the entry-level homebuyer in virtually the same regions. It not only offers homes for around $165,000 but also provides credit counseling and no-down-payment financing for qualified homebuyers.Homebuilders of late have generally focused on building much pricier homes, particularly given that lots entitled for development have escalated in cost, says Jody Kahn, senior vice president of Irvine-based John Burns Real Estate Consulting, an independent housing industry researcher and consulting firm.""But a lot of builders are anxious to see a return of the first-time homebuyer segment,"" said Kahn, who conducts monthly surveys of 225 homebuilding executives from the firm's Portsmouth, N.H., office. ""Even builders that don't cater 100% to the entry-level buyer say that they're seeing an uptick in entry-level traffic, which is a step in the right direction.""

2783,L,"Thanks mainly to the shale revolution, oil production in the U.S. hit a 28-year high last month while imports were at their lowest levels since 1995. Consequently, prices have fallen 15% since June, and Saudi Arabia has cut production by 400,000 barrels a day — providing further evidence that OPEC no longer has the power to set prices.Against these developments, the current ban on exporting American oil is nonsensical.Even the liberal Brookings Institution in a recent study concludes that it's time to remove the ban, arguing that the more we export the greater the expected decline in gasoline prices, perhaps as much as 12 cents per gallon. ""As counter-intuitive as it may seem, lifting the ban actually lowers gasoline prices by increasing the total amount of crude supply.""In addition the study identifies a number of other economic benefits from exporting oil, including higher GDP and lower unemployment.Some politicians and pundits claim that exporting oil will divert us from the path toward ""energy independence."" Others argue that exporting oil will weaken our energy security since we're still a net importer. Still others claim that keeping domestic oil at home will help lower gasoline and diesel prices.All of these arguments are baseless. Currently, we lead the world in the output of natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're still No. 3 in oil production, but the International Energy Agency projects that within a few years America will reclaim the No. 1 ranking. In short, we're already energy independent.As for energy security, it's hard to envision a political scenario that would result in our inability to import oil.Over the past two years we've seen political unrest in Iraq, Libya, Bahrain, Syria and other petroleum exporting countries, but oil prices have actually fallen. Most of the oil we import today comes from friendly nations like Canada and Mexico. OPEC now accounts for less than 10 percent of U.S. consumption, with half coming from Saudi Arabia to supply its huge refinery in Port Arthur.What's more, we still have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the unlikely event of a political conflict that could disrupt global oil movements.And because the price of oil is determined (more or less) by global supply and demand, keeping U.S. oil in the U.S. will not confer any benefits to consumers. On the other hand, exporting some of our oil can help sustain the energy boom that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent years against the backdrop of a less-than-robust economic recovery from the Great Recession.Obviously, changing the laws that banned the export of crude oil in the aftermath of the mid-1970s energy crisis will not be easy, for two reasons.First, politicians, the media and the public must recognize that oil is simply a commodity. Just as we export rice and wheat at the same time we import rice and wheat, there's no reason we shouldn't do the same with oil.Second, most mainstream environmental groups oppose oil exports for the same reason they oppose natural gas exports, offshore drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline. To them, any of these developments will bring about more fossil fuel production and more fossil fuel consumption. That's bad for the planet, end of story. But they exist outside of reality.If it makes economic and logistical sense to export some grades of oil, such as light sweet crude where we have a supply glut from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, we should do so. And if it makes economic and logistical sense to import oil, such as diluted bitumen from the Alberta Oil Sands to feed into Gulf Coast refineries that are designed to process heavy crude, we should do so as well.America is an energy-rich country, the richest in the world. We need to stop acting as though we're energy poor. Weinstein is associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute and an adjunct professor of business economics in the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University.

2828,L,"The rise of the Islamic State and its objective of re-establishing an Islamic caliphate committed to destroying Western civilization highlights a threat the U.S. has ignored for decades.Ballistic missiles outfitted with nuclear warheads could be launched against the highly vulnerable electronic infrastructure upon which our very survival depends. Such a threat is not beyond the prospective capabilities of the Islamic State and exists already from North Korea and possibly soon from Iran.A single nuclear warhead with negligible targeting accuracy detonated 100 miles or so over the U.S. could produce a ruinous electromagnetic pulse (EMP) capable of destroying our unhardened electric power grid.Without electricity, essentially all our critical infrastructure would collapse. We would be without food and water, hospitals, law enforcement, energy, transportation, communication, banking and essentially all the critical infrastructure upon which our daily lives depend.The congressionally mandated EMP Commission estimated that such an attack would lead to the death of several hundred million Americans within a year.Consider three EMP scenarios: 1) nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles launched over the North Pole, say by North Korea or Iran; 2) nuclear-armed short-, medium- or intermediate-range missiles fired by rogue states or terrorists from ships off our East or West coasts and from the Gulf of Mexico; and 3) nuclear-armed satellites launched over the South Pole by North Korea or Iran.The EMP from any of the three would also put at risk military forces that depend heavily on our civil infrastructure. Presently, no national strategy addresses these threats or supports effective countermeasures, and currently funded programs deal only with the first scenario.We advocate countering these threats with a two-pronged strategy, which can be underwritten with existing capabilities.Ballistic Missile Defense is the first prong.The U.S. Navy Aegis missile defense system is the most operationally reliable, agile and successful element in the U.S. missile defense architecture — 29 successful intercepts in 35 attempts.Its key components are operating on over 30 Aegis cruisers and destroyers around the world, and will fit in a football field-size ""Aegis Ashore"" configuration that could be deployed rapidly at U.S. military bases near our coasts, particularly near the Gulf of Mexico. It would operate in conjunction with nearby Aegis missile defense ships and our homeland ground-based missile defense sites in Alaska and California — and, in several years, in a northeastern state.Existing command and control systems can help Aegis missile defense systems intercept ballistic missiles, while increasing maritime domain awareness to help U.S. naval assets locate and interdict a threatening vessel approaching U.S. territorial waters to launch an EMP attack. Enhanced early warning and track information is especially important to warn of, and track, ballistic missiles approaching from the south.This near-term missile defense architecture would help protect America against direct attack — an important fact given the limitations of our ground-based missile defense system in Alaska and California.It also would begin countering the EMP threat right away. Such an initiative now would also help deter such an attack — other actions (e.g., a new East Coast ground-based missile defense site) will take years and will not provide the needed capability against threats from the south that are growing.Hardening our critical infrastructure — especially the electric power grid — is the second prong.Essentially all U.S. civil critical infrastructure depends on the currently unhardened electric grid. Hardening the grid would make it much more likely that key critical infrastructure can return to service quickly after an EMP event.Congress should pass the Secure High-Voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage (Shield) Act — legislation stalled for over three years in the House Energy and Commerce Committee — to help reach this objective. It mandates that electric power companies protect the national grid from EMP with technologies the Defense Department used for a half-century to harden military assets.Other principal recommendations are to: Increase funding to deploy additional Aegis interceptors and accelerate development of more effective interceptors, including against ICBMs in their boost- or ascent-phase (the optimum time for interdiction) and especially to counter key EMP threat scenarios, e.g., from ship-borne missiles off our coasts or attacks launched from ground bases by North Korea or Iran.  Develop quickly the concept of operations and assessment of the number and type of Aegis BMD ships and Aegis Ashore sites needed to protect against EMP threats launched from off our East, West and Gulf coasts — especially to end our vulnerability to attacks from the south; begin deploying/stationing those assets as soon as practical. Augment now U.S. early warning and command and control capabilities to provide maritime domain awareness to identify and prevent suspicious vessels from approaching in sufficient proximity to U.S. shores to initiate an EMP attack, and to provide sufficient information to counter such an attack.To counter a satellite attack from a southern polar trajectory where U.S. radar/sensor coverage is less focused, deploy forward-based sensors to enable our at-sea Aegis ships and California ground-based missile defense site to down a satellite attack. Given the short warning time (one to three minutes or less) to enable boost-/ascent-phase interdictions, grant pre-delegation authority for the on-the-scene Aegis missile defense commander to launch current and future air defense interceptors to shoot down satellite launchers during their boost-/ascent-phases.Concurrently, develop diplomatic initiatives to support Aegis system operations near the North Korean and Iranian coasts to enable these means to counter North Korean and Iranian missile or satellite launches. Harden immediately a minimum essential subset of the U.S. electric power grid to assure that the nation's critical infrastructure can be rapidly reconstituted following an EMP attack should the defense fail.In a natural EMP event from a massive solar storm, hardening the electric power grid would be indispensable. Congress should enact the Shield Act requiring electric utilities to protect our power grid from an EMP event.Thus, a strategy to counter the danger of a devastating EMP attack on the U.S. must include hardening our electric power infrastructure and a robust missile defense against an EMP attack. This proposed strategy represents a realistic, achievable approach to combat the growing EMP threat confronting the U.S. Cooper is chairman of High Frontier and former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Pfaltzgraff is president of the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis Inc. and Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of International Security Studies, The Fletcher School, Tufts University.

"
2884,L,"James Kraft saw opportunity and challenged it.The founder of what became Kraft Foods (KRFT) learned from working in the industry that cheese was a wild card in quality and shelf life.Cheddar in particular got moldy. Kraft (1874-1953) devoted himself to making a better product.The result is a firm that today sells an array of grocery products — from Jell-O to Oscar Mayer wieners to Capri Sun juice — and has annual revenue of more than $18 billion.In 1903 in Chicago, Kraft sold the best cheese he could find on the market by day. By night, he went through trial and error to come up with something that was consistent in taste and expiration time.At the boardinghouse where he lived, Kraft, with a new copper kettle, began to put his dairy-farm background to use. He thought that if he could blend cheese with pasteurized milk and package it in sterile containers, the result would meet his goal and criteria.His first attempts proved to be failures, but he refused to give up.Years went by before his breakthrough in 1915. He discovered that instead of heating the cheese to the point that its protein and fat separated, he needed to cook it only long enough for it to become sterile, while stirring it quickly.He poured the liquid cheese into clean containers and hermetically sealed them. As the cheese cooled, it reverted to its solid state.Solid StampIn June 1916, Kraft received a patent for the ""process of sterilizing cheese and an improved product produced by such process.""""James Lewis Kraft's 1916 patent was the pivotal moment in the history of the company,"" wrote Melanie Villines in ""The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Cheese: Stories of Kraft Food Inventors and their Inventions."" ""Processed cheese took Kraft from a commodity business with many competitors to an innovator with a unique food product. The invention laid the foundation for the wide variety of processed cheese products now available throughout the world.""By 1923, Kraft had turned his enterprise into the largest cheese company in the world.Kraft created the firm that bears his name in 1909. His taste for innovation led him to introduce products such as Velveeta cheese and Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner, Kraft Deluxe pasteurized processed cheese slices, Cheez Whiz and Miracle Whip.He further revolutionized the industry through his use of packaging with developing reusable Swanky Swigs glass containers and by embracing advertising.Born around Stevensville, Ontario, on his parents' dairy farm, Kraft was the second of 11 children.He and his siblings were brought up on the teaching of their Mennonite parents. A devotion to religion stayed with Kraft, and he donated heavily to philanthropic causes.It was on the farm and working as a grocery store clerk at age 18 that Kraft learned about the spoilage problems associated with cheese.A decade later, he was involved in a small cheese business when his partners moved him out. Kraft was living in Chicago and managing their local branch.After his ouster, he had only $65 and his industry experience. Rather than pout, he aimed to create the largest cheese firm in the world.Kraft took notice that store proprietors went to Chicago's wholesale warehouse district to buy cheese. He quickly rented a horse and wagon and reversed the process for the merchants' convenience: He bought the best cheese available wholesale, then delivered it to the merchants for good measure (and profits).""Customers came to rely on young Kraft as a vendor who offered only the highest-quality cheese,"" Villines said.Kraft had found traction. He brought four brothers in to join him, and in 1909 his company was incorporated as J.L. Kraft & Bros., with James L. Kraft as president.They initially were wholesaling 30 types of cheese under the Kraft and Elkhorn labels nationally.All the while, Kraft had been working to create a processed cheese that wouldn't eat into profit due to its perishable nature.With World War I raging in Europe, he saw the need for such a product for the Allied fighting men — and created canned cheese.Now the largest customer for Kraft's processed cheese was the military. Uncle Sam purchased 6 million pounds in cans until the war ended in November 1918.""The product was the perfect ration — a highly nutritious food that remained fresh during long-distance shipping under adverse conditions but did not require refrigeration,"" Villines wrote.World War II brought more business, and Kraft came through with preserved butter spread and canned cheese for the armed forces, devoting the entire capacity of his Freeport, Ill., plant to the effort.The industry did not applaud the initial success of Kraft's processed cheese. ""The product incurred the anger of dealers, farmers, cheese makers, as well as newspaper editors and politicians,"" Villines said. ""There seemed to be no end to the negative comments. It was called embalmed, imitation, moonshine, made over and renovated.""The public called it delicious.A 1932 study conducted by two University of Wisconsin professors reported that two-thirds of consumers preferred the taste of the processed cheese. ""During the coming years, the critics would eat their words — as per capita cheese consumption continued to rise, driven mostly by the sale of processed cheese,"" Villines wrote.Kraft got out ahead of criticism by providing facts. In 1927, he funded research at Rutgers University to examine the digestibility and nutrition of a processed cheese product in development: Velveeta.When he brought it to market in 1928, ads touted the study's results: The product was as ""digestible as milk itself, an excellent source of riboflavin and a good source of vitamin A and high-quality protein.""Villines noted: ""From the start, Americans loved Velveeta because of its superior meltability — a quality that quickly made the product the country's No. 1 cooking cheese.""In 1931, the American Medical Association gave Velveeta its seal of approval — the first time a cheese product had such a recommendation.The rise of Kraft and his company caught the attention of Thomas McInnerney, founder of National Dairy Products. In 1930, he bought Kraft's firm, by now named Kraft-Phenix Cheese, while letting it operate as an independent subsidiary for many years.That lasted until it became Kraftco in the late 1960s and went under direct control of the parent firm.Marketing ManBesides developing a slew of innovative products, Kraft was among the first in the cheese industry to recognize the value of advertising.In 1911, Kraft products were promoted on Chicago elevated trains, outdoor billboards and circulars mailed to grocers.In 1919, color ads for Kraft cheese appeared in Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal magazines.In the 1930s, his company sponsored a two-hour musical and variety show on the radio called ""Kraft Musical Review."" It later became ""Kraft Music Hall,"" which showcased top performers.Kraft introduced products such as Miracle Whip sandwich spread, Kraft macaroni and cheese and Parkay margarine on the music shows, and the products became favorites with the public. The brand name also gave credibility to Kraft caramel, marshmallows, jam and jelly.In 1947, the firm got out front with TV, sponsoring ""Kraft Television Theater.""

"
2929,L,"The fast-moving boom in unconventional gas and oil production has altered the pipelines sector, once a slow-changing, utility-grade investment. New pipelines are being built and existing lines reversed to serve an evolving map of opportunities.
"
2930,L,"A large share of those lines has come under ownership of master limited partnerships (MLPs), a tax-advantaged business model luring income investors with large cash distributions, much like dividends.
"
2931,L,"In August, early MLP adopter Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP) abandoned the business model in order to gain more financial and operational flexibility. Hinds Howard, a vice president and assistant portfolio manager at CBRE Clarion Securities and a long-time specialist in the MLP space, discusses the causes behind Kinder Morgan's move, the ripple effects upon other MLPs and the general status of the MLP sector.
"
2932,L,"IBD: What were some of the reasons behind Kinder Morgan shedding its MLP format?
"
2933,L,"Hinds Howard: The problem was that they had grown so much so fast. For many years, they were the fastest-growing MLP out there in terms of distribution per unit. The way MLPs are restructured is: the faster you grow your distribution per unit, the faster you run up the ladder of the set of distribution rights (to the general partner).
"
2934,L,"KMP had grown so much from such a small base that the GP, Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), was receiving 44% of all cash distributions. So in order for KMP to grow its distribution $1, it had to make $2 of distributable cash flow — and that's a problem.
"
2935,L,"IBD: So how does that compare to other MLPs out there? Are there others at risk of being forced to make the same sort of move?
"
2936,L,"Howard: There are other MLPs that will eventually have that problem, but it was compounded at the KMP level because KMP was so big. Kinder Morgan bought a $5 billion company (Copano, in May 2013), and it didn't move the needle at all. If you are doing $5 billion acquisitions that don't have much of an impact, it can be really hard to grow.
"
2937,L,"(Among other MLPs,) Plains All American (PAA) may be the closest; maybe they are around 40% in terms of cash that goes to the GP. But nobody is close to the 45% cash to the GP that Kinder was. (Plains' distribution/dividend yield is near 4.4%, vs. 5.8% for Kinder Morgan.)
"
2938,L,"Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) had the same problem (as KMP). They solved it by buying their GP, by internalizing it, several years ago. Other MLPs have also done that: Magellan Midstream (MMP), Buckeye Partners (BPL)...
"
2939,L,"IBD: Will the KMI/KMP restructuring have any impact on the MLP space?
"
2940,L,"Howard: Yes, it will. It will have an impact on the indexes (that track MLPs) and on the funds that flow into the sector. Another factor is that a lot of the KMP unit holders were investors from early on who had such a low (cost) basis in their stock. So people that ordinarily would never have sold their Kinder Morgan are now being forced to sell. They will face huge tax consequences, and they will be forced to go out and find a new place for their capital.
"
2941,L,"(The KMP/KMI restructuring) is bullish for the sector just from a technical standpoint.
"
2942,L,"In terms of indexes and people who can sell their units and move on to another MLP, and just the way Kinder is talking about buying other MLPs — (all this) will have a positive impact on the sector.
"
2943,L,"IBD: So, beyond Kinder Morgan, where does the MLP space stand at this point? Is it maturing?
"
2944,L,"Howard: We've never had as much visibility in terms of distribution growth as we have now. MLPs are less and less reliant on acquiring other companies — on these crapshoot M&A auction processes. They are more and more reliant on clear and visible production growth, and you have several years of cap ex plans to look at.
"
2945,L,"So you can see more clearly now than you could in the past that distributions are going to be sustainable at a higher rate for longer. What that means is that is starting to get priced in. People are more and more comfortable with MLPs, as a sector, growing 6% to 8% a year.
"
2946,L,"So their multiples are going up. That means it's getting harder and harder to find value in the sector, but fundamentally things are moving in the right direction.
"
2947,L,"IBD: What is your outlook here? How should investors moving into MLPs in the coming year look at the space?
"
2948,L,"Howard: In general, the MLPs that will do fine are the ones that are already at premiums. Those will continue to grow. But some of that growth is already baked in, so if you want to really outperform, it's going to have to come from one of three categories.
"
2949,L,"The best-performing MLP in the next 12 months will probably be one that has underperformed in the last 12 months. Boardwalk Pipeline Energy (BWP) partners, for example, cut its distribution (in February), and it's already up 50% plus since its bottom off that cut (with its yield at 2.2%).
"
2950,L,"The second bucket will be some recent IPO. High-growth MLP IPOs have done phenomenally well: names like Valero Energy Partners (VLP) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP). And the market will probably also continue to get excited about name-brand MLPs with big drop-down potential.Special Report: Income InvestingThe fast-moving boom in unconventional gas and oil production has altered the pipelines sector, once a slow-changing, utility-grade investment.

They are more and more reliant on clear and visible production growth, and you have several years of cap ex plans to look at.So you can see more clearly now than you could in the past that distributions are going to be sustainable at a higher rate for longer. What that means is that is starting to get priced in. People are more and more comfortable with MLPs, as a sector, growing 6% to 8% a year.So their multiples are going up. That means it's getting harder and harder to find value in the sector, but fundamentally things are moving in the right direction.IBD: What is your outlook here? How should investors moving into MLPs in the coming year look at the space?Howard: In general, the MLPs that will do fine are the ones that are already at premiums. Those will continue to grow. But some of that growth is already baked in, so if you want to really outperform, it's going to have to come from one of three categories.The best-performing MLP in the next 12 months will probably be one that has underperformed in the last 12 months. Boardwalk Pipeline Energy (BWP) partners, for example, cut its distribution (in February), and it's already up 50% plus since its bottom off that cut (with its yield at 2.2%).The second bucket will be some recent IPO. High-growth MLP IPOs have done phenomenally well: names like Valero Energy Partners (VLP) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP). And the market will probably also continue to get excited about name-brand MLPs with big drop-down potential.

2956,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of 89 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. The bottom line also improved 2.3% year over year.Loews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Loews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote The company witnessed lower earnings at Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP  -  Free Report) plus lower parent company net investment income. However, higher earnings at CNA Financial (CNA  -  Free Report) and Loews Hotels offset this downside. Also, share buybacks leading to lower share count fueled a year-over-year improvement.Behind the HeadlinesOperating revenues of $3.6 billion increased 9.4% year over year. Rise in insurance premiums and other revenues aided this improvement.Total expenses increased 13.8% year over year to $3.2 billion, mainly due to higher contract drilling expenses and other operating costs.Book value as of Mar 31, 2018 was $57.48 per share, down 0.6% from $57.83 as of Dec 31, 2017.Segment DetailsCNA Financial’s revenues rose nearly 8.8% from the prior-year quarter to $2.5 billion. Its reported net income attributable to Loews Corp. is $261 million, reflecting an increase of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter owing to the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and improved P&C underwriting results. However, decline in limited partnership investment results, higher adverse reserve development under the 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution loss portfolio transfer as well as lower realized investment results partially offset the upside.Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues decreased 8.4% year over year to $337 million. Net income attributable to Loews Corp., dipped 2.7% to $36 million, attributable to revenue impact stemming from the restructuring of a transportation contract in 2017, lower storage and parking plus lending revenues.Loews Hotels’ revenues improved 9.6 % year over year to $183 million. Income owing to Loews Corp. surged 30% to $13 million, driven by an improved operating performance at joint venture properties.Diamond Offshore’s revenues fell 20.7% year over year to $299 million. Net income attributable to Loews Corp. was $10 million, down 16.8% year over year.  This drop was due to persistent depressed market conditions, partially offset by a lower depreciation expense resulting mainly from asset impairment charges incurred in prior years.Share Repurchase UpdateThe company bought back 9.9 million shares worth $497 million in the first quarter.

2960,L,"The first-quarter earnings season has already seen 154 members of the elite S&P 500 index reporting financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.4% increase in total earnings on 10.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 72.1%, outperforming on the top-line front. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings growth in the first quarter is registered as the strongest in seven years.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a sturdy performance till now with earnings increasing 27.5% on 8.7% robust revenues. The beat ratio is solid with 80.5% companies exceeding bottom-line estimates and 61% outpacing the top-line mark. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 27% on 5.8% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have boosted higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from reaching a historical high, yet it is showing an upward trend. With economic growth gaining traction, the Fed has hiked rate five times since December 2015 and has hinted at two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to weather the low rate environment, they stand to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the implementation of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. This rate reduction will probably provide an additional drive to insurers’ bottom line.Although the first quarter witnessed a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the calamities still might not dent the company’s underwriting profitability. Insurers having already suffered the severities of cat loss last year, should have managed to withstand the shortfalls in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion.Nonetheless, underwriting profitability is mildly strained. Recently, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) reported a drag of 64 cents on its bottom line attributable to cat loss.Improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are expected to have helped insurers weather the deficits.Diverse product portfolio, expanded geographies and strategic acquisitions might have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Apr 30.Loews Corporation’s (L  -  Free Report) quarterly result is likely to be aided by a consistently better performance at CNA Financial, a Lowes subsidiary. Loews Hotels is likely to have continued to deliver a strong performance, banking on solid operations at its hotel properties. Boardwalk Pipeline is expected to have delivered better numbers on the strength of its growth projects.  However, lower day rate and lower rigs working are expected to have weighed on Diamond Offshore (DO) segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 10.3% year-over-year decline. Loews carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes our surprise prediction difficult as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote (Read more: Can Solid CNA Financial Results Drive Loews Q1 Earnings?)You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is likely to have witnessed higher premiums on new business growth as well as a solid retention. A favorable rate environment drove the investment income. Underwriting profitability is likely to have been affected by cat loss and the combined ratio has also probably deteriorated.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 90 cents for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 3.5% year over year. Though CNA Financial has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -3.91% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

2961,L,"That investors favor Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) is confirmed by its share price movement.

With a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million. Reasons Behind the RallyThe company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 121.22%.Improving revenues and effective cost-control measures have helped the company deliver a strong 2017.

It will also add to return on average common equity by more than 30bps and to return on average tangible common equity by more than 400bps in the second year. Kemper estimates $55 million in annual pre-tax cost savings post integration.Banking on continued operational performance, Kemper has effectively lowered its leverage.

The company’s ROE expanded 350 basis points year over year to 4.1% in 2017.Lower tax rate due to the overhaul in tax policy, which slashed the rate to 21% from 35%, will likely boost to the bottom line.Kemper has also been strengthening its underwriting operations. The company has an aggregate catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2018 in place, providing $50 million of coverage, in excess of $60 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues translates into a year-over-year improvement of 126.8% and 2.3% for 2018.

2962,L,"Timing a Fed rate hike is no doubt tricky. But if you ask the market participants, they are almost certain that Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve will increase its benchmark rate by 0.25%, at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21. They further anticipate the Fed to continue their hawkish stance this year, on the back of a healthy labor market and steady rise in inflation.With the Fed set to raise rates for the first time this year, expect financials, technology and home improvement suppliers to benefit. Home builders and utility players, on the other hand, could lose from the Fed’s rate decision.Fed Set to Hike Rates for the First Time in 2018At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting, the Fed will issue a rate decision. Market pundits consider a quarter-percentage point rate hike a near-certainty. The futures market is already indicating 100% chance of a rate hike, culminating into the sixth rate increase since December 2015. Market participants also widely expect the Fed to project four rate hikes this year. So far, a maximum of three rate hikes are expected for the year.But why we are expecting a hawkish Fed? This is because the current economic backdrop paints a rosy picture, especially, when you consider steady rise in wages, record low unemployment rate and upbeat consumer confidence levels. The Trump administration, in the meantime, has decided to add extra stimulus in the form of tax cuts and deregulations.Perhaps the even more crucial factor for the Fed to hike rates is hotter-than-expected signs of inflation. Recent signs indicate that inflation is tilting toward the central bank’s 2% annual target. Needless to say, the near-term inflation expectations have climbed this month to the highest level in three years. Thus, the Fed is likely to reiterate its January’s statement that inflation “will move up this year.”Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate EnvironmentWith an overwhelming majority of observers seeing an imminent rate hike with more to follow this year, certain sectors stand to gain, while some will suffer.Winners: Asset-Sensitive BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade. As a general rule, higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very much rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings jump from a quarter-point rate hike. In the year-to-date period, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) generated steady returns of 4.2% on increasing expectations of a rate hike this month.Winners: InsurersVery few companies are rooting for a rate hike as much as those from the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.As of the last filing, the top three holdings of the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report), XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) have soared 44.6%, 58.1% and 18.2%, respectively, so far this year on rate hike expectations.Winners: Asset ManagersBrokerage firms and asset managers advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenue, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Winners: Technology & Home ImprovementOther than the broader financial sector, technology firms also stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day. And a stronger economy could easily boost the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung.Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for new houses and instead look for improving their existing ones. Sesha Dhanyamraju, CEO of Digital Risk added that “remodelers and home-improvement suppliers benefit from a rising-rate scenario.” Thus, home improvement majors Lowe’s Cos. (L  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) stand to gain the most.Losers: Home ConstructionBut, with the Fed expected to hike rates, the average American will bear the brunt of higher borrowing costs. This is surely a dampener to real estate activities.James Cassel, chairman and co-founder of the investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter in Miami added that if rate hike happens, losers might include “construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.”Losers: UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive business and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements. Hence, these companies have high level of debt loads. Low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.The industry’s bellwether ETF, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has yielded a negative return of 4.9% in the year-to-date period on rate hike concerns.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2963,L,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.5% downward and for 2019, moved 1.8% south. Shares of Prudential have gained 1.7% in a year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 5.6%The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of D. Back-tested results show that stocks with a favorable Growth Score of A or B combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) comfortably outperform others.Prudential has also been grappling with increasing expenses, weighing on the operating income expansion and inducing volatility in the bottom line. While total benefits and expenses increased 23% in the last five years, the operating margin contracted 270 basis points in the past three years.The company has delivered an average four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 0.60%.Prudential’s exposure to products like annuities and universal life, which guarantee minimum return, might strain its capital. Its results have been suffering due to additional reserve accretion required when the low interest rate increases the value of these liabilities. The company also expects near-term challenges in sales.The Fed has scheduled its meeting on Mar 20 and 21, 2018. It had earlier hinted at three rate hikes in the current year. The anticipation of the first rate raise this month as indicated by the Federal Reserve earlier at the Jan 31 meeting has restored hope. The interest rate now ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%.Prudential has been deemed a systematically important financial institution (SIFI) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Capital requirements for insurance SIFIs will be based on an insurance capital framework. Stricter capital standards might slow down the pace of capital deployment.Choosing the StocksThere are other worthy options for investors not as big a name as Prudential but certainly with promises of greater returns in their pockets.We have boiled down to three favorable stocks with potential to enrich one’s portfolio.

2964,L,"New analyst coverage unearths extensive data on stocks for investors. Analysts are privy to vital information which is crucial for investment decisions. Lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks (over or undervalued).Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst(s) usually portrays higher investor inclination. Investors, on their part, often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it. In other words, they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value.Obviously, stocks are not randomly chosen to cover. New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst(s). At times, increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it. After all, who doesn’t like to produce something that is already in demand? Hence, we often find that analysts’ ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks.Needless to say, the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change.Impact on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts. Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage. Positive recommendations — Buy and Strong Buy — generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations. On the contrary, analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation.Now, if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage, investors start paying more attention to it. Also, any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock.So, it’s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks.Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago (This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage).Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago ('Less than' means 'better than' four weeks ago).Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof.Here are the other screening parameters:Price greater than or equal to $5 (as a stock below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors).Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if volume isn’t enough, it will not attract individual investors).Here are five of the seven stocks that passed the screen:Heritage Commerce Corp. (HTBK  -  Free Report) is a holding company of Heritage Bank of Commerce, Heritage Bank East Bay, Heritage Bank South Valley and Bank of Los Altos.

2965,L,"Enstar Group Limited’s  Lloyd managing agency, StarStone Underwriting Limited, completed the previously announced reinsurance-to-close transaction with Neon Underwriting Limited for Enstar Group’s Syndicate 2008. The closure of this transaction is expected to help Enstar Group’s Syndicate 2008 undertake the liabilities of the 2015 underwriting year of Neon’s Syndicate 2468 (which comprised underwriting years starting from 2008 to 2015).The transaction, first announced on Dec 20, 2017, satisfied the required regulatory approvals and got completed in the first quarter of 2018, well within the stipulated time frame. Following the completion of the transaction, Enstar Group assumed net reinsurance reserves of £337.8 million (about $456.4 million) pertaining to the portfolio and gross reserves of £402.2 million (about $543.4 million).In fact, Enstar Group is likely to undertake the responsibility for claims handling and offer a complete finality to Neon post wrapping up of the transaction.Enstar Group’s already strong relationship with Neon will possibly be further enhanced and cemented with the close of this deal. Notably, a similar transaction was completed in 2016. The latest reinsurance-to-close transaction will raise the total number of Enstar Group’s completed legacy transactions on Lloyd’s platform to 21 since its inception. This not only strengthens but also boosts the Multi line insurer’s position as one of the industry-leading providers of legacy solutions to the Lloyd’s market.Enstar Group as a multi-faceted insurance group provides its clients with innovative capital release solutions and specialty underwriting capabilities. Given a strong track record of purchasing more than 80 companies and portfolios as well as closed legacy transactions, the Multi line insurer has made a name for itself in the industry. Banking on a sustained operational performance and solid underwriting capabilities, we expect this insurer to continue to undertake such transactions in the near term. Consequently, this will provide an impetus to the company’s already solid portfolio and accelerate its overall growth.Shares of Enstar Group have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 1.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.2%. Further, we anticipate better investment results, improving fees and commission income plus a robust capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term. Stocks That Warrant a LookInvestors interested in stocks from the insurance industry can consider Radian Group Inc.

2968,L,"In an effort to expand business in the U.K., AIG Life Ltd. (AIGLL), a unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), has announced that it will acquire of Ellipse, a specialist provider of group life risk protection in the UK, from Munich Re.The deal, likely to see the light of day by the first quarter of 2019, will enable AIGLL to better manage group risk schemes for companies of all sizes with the help of Ellipse’s group protection capabilities, which includes life, critical illness and income protection products. Also, the acquiring company’s technology-enabled business model will ease processing.The transaction strengthens AIG’s position in Life & Retirement businesses and is highly complementary to AIG’s existing UK Individual Protection offering. With Ellipse, the company will be able to gain traction from the growing group insurance market of the U.K.AIG has chosen Ellipse, driven by its superior operating performance, evident from strong growth in 2009, which made it the 6th largest UK group life provider based on its new business volumes, registered in 2017.The financial size of the transaction was left undisclosed but the deal will be funded by cash.Earlier dring the year AIG announced to acquire Validus Holdings, Ltd., a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and asset management services. This transaction would strengthen its global General Insurance business by expanding the company’s current product portfolio through additional distribution channels as well as advancing the tools available to enhance underwriting.AIG had been struggling with weak business growth and has been suffering revenue declines since 2013, which persisted during the first quarter of 2018 as well. The company languished under its own weight with numerous business operations creating little or no synergy. This bearish scenario  dented the company’s profitability. Management therefore took to massive amount of divestitures, selling a number of consolidating businesses to slash costs.The stock has lost 12.4%, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.6%. The company’s CEO Brian Duperreault, appointed last year, has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy with a view to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible buyouts in the international markets, boosting the company’s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases.  We will thus be little surprised to hear about more deals from the company going forward.Hence, a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the company’s bottom line.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Cigna Corp.

2969,L,"Though the hotel industry performed well in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, there are a number of threats that remain. Unfavorable government policies, uncertainty in certain markets and RevPAR pressure pose challenges for industry players. These issues could potentially offset the group’s positive growth prospects in the near-to-mid-term.Decline in U.S. Tourism a Major ConcernTravel and tourism has witnessed a decline in the past few years. At the recent annual NYU International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, Jonathan Tisch, Chairman and CEO of Loews (L  -  Free Report) and Chairman Emeritus of the U.S. Travel Association, said travel and tourism is an $8 trillion market and represents approximately 10% of global GDP. He further said that that the sector is likely to grow by $3.5 trillion over the next decade.Despite the growth in the global tourism, the U.S. share of the market has declined roughly 13% over the past few years. International visitors have declined 7.4 million over that time period.The Trump administration’s restrictive policies on immigration and tourist visas appear to have played a role. The slowdown in U.S.-bound air travel bookings ever since the Trump administration came into office also point in that direction. Also, online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have declined.Continuous efforts to impose a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations, along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same threaten travel demand to and from the United States.While the U.S. tourism industry remains very strong, the change at the margin is less robust than could potentially have been without these restrictive policies, which is a net negative for many industry players.Decelerating RevPar Growth & Rising CostsThough, per the recent estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), RevPar in 2018 is estimated to increase to 3% from 2.9% in 2017, the rate of growth has declined sharply over the past few years. Most of the hotel companies in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late because of continued muted international visitation. Moreover, continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR.With an improvement in the economy and drop in unemployment levels, industry players will struggle to control their largest operating expense — labor costs. Rising salaries, wages and benefits, as well as increased staffing levels will add to their labor costs.Uncertainty in a Few International Markets In spite of immense growth potential, industry players are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social/political impact of Brexit and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia. Though Trump’s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia, instead of the United States, these regions have their own share of concerns.Notably, a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and limiting overall sales. In fact, a weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil resulted in softer tourism numbers in 2015, 2016 and 2017. This is not expected to change much in 2018. Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to limit revenues of hotel industry players.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Terror assaults in key European cities like London, Paris, Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind. Additionally, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.Meanwhile, in the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends. Any respite from these headwinds in the region is not expected in the near term.Most of the leading hotel companies have considerable presence in the above-mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to adverse economic conditions in these regions.Stocks to AvoidPlayers in the space that induce our cautious-to-bearish outlook are Red Lion Hotels Corp. (RLH  -  Free Report), China Lodging Group, Ltd. (HTHT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (WYND  -  Free Report). Red Lion Hotels carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), whereas China Lodging Group and Wyndham Destinations have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wrapping UpDecline in inbound international travelers is a major concern for the industry. Continuous efforts to impose inbound travel ban from certain countries and stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas are clouding the prospects of the U.S. hotel industry. Additionally, various geopolitical and economic woes, oversupply and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the industry.A strengthening U.S. dollar may further add to the woes. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by the industry players can offset these negatives.Let us see how these companies fare, brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2970,L,"The likelihood of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its June 12-13 FOMC meeting is pretty high. The Fed funds rate is expected to tick up 25 basis points, with another hike or two anticipated this year. The possibility is backed by low unemployment, wage growth and rise in headline inflation.With the Fed set to raise rates, we expect financials, technology, home improvement suppliers and even gold to benefit.Outlook for June HikeA blowout jobs report in May has raised the odds of a June rate hike. Around 223,000 new positions were created last month, which drove jobless rate down to levels around 50 years ago. The number of job openings now exceeds the number of job seekers for the first time since 2000.In such a tight labor market, corporates have to raise wages to restrict other companies from poaching their workers. By the way, hourly pay went up 8 cents or 0.3% to $28.92 an hour last month. In the last 12 months, wages rose to 2.7% after remaining at 2.6% for three months at a stretch.Higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon. Higher inflation, in turn, leads to increased interest rates. Minutes from the Fed’s May 2 meeting had already shown that most of the policymakers have agreed that a strong economic outlook warranted a rate hike “soon.”The U.S. economy is firing on all fronts, with consumer spending rebounding, business investments remaining firm and net exports showing solid strength. Thus, the annualized growth rate in the second quarter is expected at around 4%.Fed to Stick With Gradual Rate HikesTraders in the federal funds futures market are now pricing in a 94% chance of a quarter-point rate increase this month. That’s no surprise, given the encouraging economic outlook.Fed is also sticking to gradual rate hikes this year. After all, concerns over trade disputes and strains in emerging markets remain. The median estimates from economists see two more hikes this year, which matches the Fed’s own projections back in March, per a recent Bloomberg survey.Financials to Win BigWith an overwhelming majority of observers seeing an imminent rate hike with more to follow this year, financials stands to gain. Banks are definitely the go-to rate trade. Higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Insurers, by the way, derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins.An increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments, which also bodes well for brokerage firms and asset managers.Technology & Home Improvement Stand to GainOther than the broader financial sector, technology firms stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day and that could easily boost the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report).Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for houses and instead look for improving their existing ones. Thus, home improvement majors Lowe’s Cos. (LOW  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) stand to gain.Rising Rates Don’t Affect GoldThere is a popular belief that a rise in interest rates makes bonds more alluring and thus money flows out of gold. But, a long-term trend shows that interest rates and gold prices don’t have such a negative correlation. Such a correlation over the past half century has been only 28%, which is not significant.And why not? The price of gold is not a function of interest rates. It is more of a function of supply and demand in the long term. Rising rates, in fact, at times turns out to be bullish for gold as it is simply bearish for stocks like utilities and home construction, to name a few.5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, we have selected five solid stocks from these areas that boast a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).National Bank Holdings Corporation (NBHC  -  Free Report) is a bank holding company operating full-service banking centers located in Colorado and the greater Kansas City region.

2971,L,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is L due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Loews (L  -  Free Report) Q1 Earnings Beat, Rise Y/Y on Lower Share CountLoews reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of 89 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. The bottom line also improved 2.3% year over year.The company witnessed lower earnings at Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners plus lower parent company net investment income. However, higher earnings at CNA Financial and Loews Hotels offset this downside. Also, share buybacks leading to lower share count fueled a year-over-year improvement.Behind the HeadlinesOperating revenues of $3.6 billion increased 9.4% year over year. Rise in insurance premiums and other revenues aided this improvement.Total expenses increased 13.8% year over year to $3.2 billion, mainly due to higher contract drilling expenses and other operating costs.Book value as of Mar 31, 2018 was $57.48 per share, down 0.6% from $57.83 as of Dec 31, 2017.Segment DetailsCNA Financial’s revenues rose nearly 8.8% from the prior-year quarter to $2.5 billion. Its reported net income attributable to Loews Corp. is $261 million, reflecting an increase of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter owing to the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and improved P&C underwriting results. However, decline in limited partnership investment results, higher adverse reserve development under the 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution loss portfolio transfer as well as lower realized investment results partially offset the upside.Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues decreased 8.4% year over year to $337 million. Net income attributable to Loews Corp., dipped 2.7% to $36 million, attributable to revenue impact stemming from the restructuring of a transportation contract in 2017, lower storage and parking plus lending revenues.Loews Hotels’ revenues improved 9.6 % year over year to $183 million. Income owing to Loews Corp. surged 30% to $13 million, driven by an improved operating performance at joint venture properties.Diamond Offshore’s revenues fell 20.7% year over year to $299 million. Net income attributable to Loews Corp. was $10 million, down 16.8% year over year.  This drop was due to persistent depressed market conditions, partially offset by a lower depreciation expense resulting mainly from asset impairment charges incurred in prior years.Share Repurchase UpdateThe company bought back 9.9 million shares worth $497 million in the first quarter. Subsequently, through Apr 27, 2018, the company repurchased another 4 million shares for $207 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.Loews Corporation Price and Consensus  Loews Corporation Price and Consensus | Loews Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, L has an average Growth Score of C. Its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. The stock was also allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and momentum investors while growth investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, L has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.
"
2972,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at L given that, according to its RSI reading of 25.78, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, L’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Loews’s earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 2 earnings estimate revision move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for L has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $3.48/share two months ago to $3.50/share right now.If this wasn’t enough, Loews also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2973,L,"We certainly are not hurting for things to talk about ahead of Monday’s opening bell: from waking up to find out who won last night’s wild World Series Game 5 in Houston to the first indictments coming down the pike in the FBI-commissioned investigation involving those around the Trump presidential campaign — plus Q3 earnings season continuing its accelerated amount of reports released — there is plenty of grist for the mill. Also, President Trump may be expected to make his decision for who will replace Janet Yellen as Chair for the Federal Reserve this week.Also, Personal Income and Spending numbers have hit the tape this morning, coming in at an as-expected +0.4%. This follows the unrevised previous month’s +0.2%. Spending on the headline reached 1%, slightly higher than the +0.8% analysts had been looking for. Real personal spending was +0.6%, with the core read month over month at a tame +0.1%, year over year +1.3% and the year-over-year deflator at +1.6%.What these numbers suggest in a nutshell is a slight but growing uptick in U.S. citizens’ income, with an even more exuberant attitude toward spending. Coming as this report does following the recovery and rebuilding efforts after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, perhaps these high-than-expected numbers, where they exist, are a near-term reaction as much as a long-term growth trajectory. In any case, more positive economic data ahead of this year’s holiday season, which may also point to positive consumer attitudes toward Q4 growth.Obama-appointed Fed Governor Jay Powell looks to be Trump’s favorite to replace Yellen as Fed Chair, which is an announcement we may see this week, especially in light of other headline-making commotion coming out of the nation’s capital today and perhaps through the week. Yellen’s term expires next February, and it is widely assumed Trump will put his signature on this decision. Former front runners for Yellen’s replacement had been former QE skeptic Kevin Warsh, among others.Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort has surrendered to authorities this morning, in the first of two indictments passed down from Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s office. The second, businessman Rick Gates, is a long-time advisor of Manafort’s. The 12 counts from the Federal Grand Jury are: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agents of a foreign principal (Ukraine), making false and misleading statements and seven violations of failure to file foreign account documents.Last week, new allegations from the White House regarding former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s involvement with the Russian government also came to the fore. At this stage, however, this report seems unlikely to be related to the Mueller report.Q3 Earnings Stay RevvedAccording to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s Earnings Preview report last Friday, we’ve already seen 54% of quarterly reports in from the S&P 500 as of the end of last week. Q3 revenue growth currently rides +6.7% growth, versus +5.0% in the trailing 4-quarter average, and the 3-year trailing average of just +0.2%. Over the next 5 days, we expect nearly 900 more reports, including from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) after the bell in the days ahead.New York-based conglomerate Loews Corp. (L  -  Free Report) reported a 1-cent beat ahead of today’s opening bell — 3 cents per share versus 2 cents in the Zacks consensus. Operating revenue rose 9.4% in the quarter, while total expenses fell 29% year over year.Loews component CNA Corp.  also beat earnings estimates, reporting 58 cents per share versus 51 cents we has been expecting. Another Loews component, Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO  -  Free Report), posted a big earnings miss before today’s opening bell, reporting 8 cents per share as opposed to the Zacks consensus of 19 cents. Revenues of $366 million in the quarter, however, topped the $363 million in our consensus estimate.

2975,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating earnings of 46 cents per share that declined nearly 53% year over year due to huge catastrophe losses and loss from early redemption of debt.The company stated that excluding these non-recurring items, earnings improved $25 million year over year, driven by higher earnings at CNA Financial (CNA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) and better results from investment portfolio.Loews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Loews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation QuoteBehind the HeadlinesOperating revenue of $3.5 billion increased 9.4% year over year. Rise in insurance premiums, contract drilling revenues and other revenues aided this improvement.Total expenses increased 29% year over year to $3.3 billion, mainly due to higher insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits, contract drilling expenses and other operating costs.Book value as of Sep 30, 2017 was $56.41 per share, up about 3.3% from $54.62 as of Dec 31, 2016.Segment DetailsCNA Financial’s revenues inched up 0.3% from the prior-year quarter to $2.4 billion.

2976,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the estimates.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Factors to be Considered This QuarterConsecutive catastrophes likely have been a drag on CNA Financial’s (CNA  -  Free Report) third-quarter results. However, an intensified focus on underwriting standards might have limited this downside.Last quarter, the Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment benefited from higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment. The yet-to-be reported quarter likely has witnessed these favorable factors leading to higher contribution from Diamond Offshore.Results at Loews Hotels are expected to have improved this yet-to-be-reported quarter.Expenses likely have increased, weighing on the desired margin expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Loews Corp. has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 2 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Loews Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are as follows:Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 1 with an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2977,L,"With a Chinese-American “trade war” averted for now — although many, like Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, have long argued we were never going to wind up in one anyway — market indexes have breathed easier, with the Dow up nearly 300 points to close above 25K from the first time since all-time highs were being scaled early this year. In fact, all major indexes closed in the green yesterday, and look to build modestly on those levels in today’s pre-market.Specifically, China has agreed to lower its tariff on imported U.S. autos from 25% to 15%, and this followed concessions made by President Trump that lifts a trade ban to Chinese telecom giant ZTE. Perhaps we’ll see more specifics regarding the trade environment between the world’s two largest economies, but ultimately, until things like Intellectual Property and the respect thereof are addressed, don’t expect much by way of seismic shifts in our trade relationship with China. That said, pressures the markets have felt since Trump’s decision 12 weeks ago to crank up tariffs on steel and aluminum are finally feeling some relief, and it shows.For more on this subject, check out a new Zacks article on Chinese-American trade relations: U.S.-China Work Out Trade Truce: 5 Top WinnersElsewhere, we see the Russell 2000 continue to make gains relative to the major U.S. indexes. Though this large group of small-cap stocks only accounts for not even 10% of publicly traded domestic market cap, many analysts look at trades into small-caps as a “risk-on” environment, which naturally supports bullish market sentiment, and may key another leg up on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.In company-specific news, J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) has lost its CEO Marvin Ellison, effective immediately, as the chief of the beleaguered department store retailer has accepted the CEO role at home improvement major Lowe’s (L  -  Free Report) this summer. This has caused JCP shares to plummet yet another 8.4% in today’s pre-market, down to barely north of $2 per share — levels not seen since the 1980s, and a universe away from its peak a year prior to the Great Recession over a decade ago of more than $82 per share. Fortunes for the long-suffering retailer may now be in doubt.For Lowe’s, which had seen its all-time highs back in the heady January 2018 days, this morning’s news is being received quite well, to the tune of +2.8% in share price. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) specialty retailer expects to benefit from Ellison’s tenure at rival Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) prior to his station as head of J.C. Penney.

2979,L,"MetLife Inc.(MET  -  Free Report) has entered into a strategic partnership with China-based internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s (TCEHY  -  Free Report) digital insurance provider, WeSure. The alliance aims at offering insurance solutions to travelers through WeSure online insurance platform.This win-win partnership would on one hand, provide MetLife access to WeSure's 1 billion monthly active users on Tencent's mobile social communications platform, WeChat. While on the other, WeSure’s extensive member base will benefit from MetLife’s global expertise in life and health protection solutions. Thus, this alliance will enable both companies to jointly excel in big-data analysis and tailor-made, intelligent value-added services, offering more convenience and transparent end-to-end protection solutions for Chinese travelers.The first offering through this tie-up would be an aviation accident insurance product, to be provided on the WeSure platform. With focus on an optimized customer experience and protection level, this cost-effective solution would help creating customer delight in a more dynamic way.The company has  a track record of continuously benefitting its customers with long-term protection products along with maintaining a strict corporate governance and robust risk management systems in its operations. In return, it has witnessed steady growth, supported by a solid financial performance and an improving customer satisfaction. This recent pact with WeSure will likely bolster MetLife's focus on further improving its customer experience in China.The company has been strengthening its digital footprint through several alliances and deals in order to develop new products and services. Earlier this year, MetLife formed a strategic association with Ernst & Young LLP  to deliver a cutting-edge workplace financial wellness solution.Although shares of the company have lost 11% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 9%, these inorganic efforts are expected to favor the stock going forward. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMetLife has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2980,L,"The last day of the first month of Q2 earnings season kicks off with another huge week of Q2 earnings reports. Though we’ve come off the top of the mountain peak last Thursday, we still see a huge plate of earnings ahead, including 130 S&P 500 companies — perhaps most importantly Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which reports after the bell tomorrow.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Apple is expected to bring in $1.57 per share, a +10.56% upswing from a year ago. Revenues are expected to reach $44.71 billion, or up 5.55% from fiscal Q3 2017. The Zacks ESP figure (which predicts actual earnings results beyond simply the consensus) is $1.59, or +1.57%. Over the past 4 quarters, Apple has beaten estimates each time, at an average of 2.77% per quarter.Eurozone unemployment this morning headlines with a 9.1% number. Though this is far higher than the monthly reads in the U.S., one must consider the laggards within the EU overall, such as countries like Greece, which has far higher unemployment than countries like Germany.Ahead of the bell today, investment conglomerate Loews Corp. (L  -  Free Report) reported Q2 earnings of 76 cents per share, exactly as expected by the Zacks consensus estimate. Its CNA (CNA  -  Free Report) insurance group brought in 88 cents per share, better than the 75 cents expected. The combined ratio of Property & Casualty income was +3.7% year over year. Net operating income improved 18.9% from Q2 2016.Loews’ Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations, posting 45 cents per share as compared to the 24 cents expected, on $399.29 million in quarterly sales, far beyond the $386.93 million in the Zacks consensus estimate. This fits with the outstanding performance of the oil drilling firm over the last four quarters, which have all beaten estimates, and by an average of 331.6%. This is largely due to the 900% earnings beat in Q2 of 2016.

2985,L,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with 322 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers already. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, performances indicate a 15% increase in total earnings on 9.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 79.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 77%, outperforming on the top line.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings grew 4.7% on 4.3% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, an integral component of the Finance sector, is likely to perform slightly better in the fourth quarter compared with the third one. However, insurers’ underwriting profitability is still anticipated to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the quarter to be reported. This downside is further likely to add to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn, has even helped improving the premiums as well as driving the top line.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three rate raises in 2017, the last being in December, having buoyed enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and a strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, slashing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is estimated to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable degree. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is projected to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 12.With the occurrence of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter, Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is likely to have experienced higher catastrophe loss hurt the company’s underwriting profitability in the fourth quarter. Increase in expenses is anticipated to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the Multi line insurer’s overall performance in turn. Nonetheless, the company has possibly displayed better-than-expected results at Loews Hotels. Also, Diamond Offshore segment gained from higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment.

2986,L,"A.M. Best has retained the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (ICR) of ‘a-’of Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report). Concurrently, the rating giant reiterated the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of ‘aa-’ of the domestic life and health insurance subsidiaries of Prudential.Prudential’s two recently issued senior unsecured notes also received Long-Term IRs of ‘a-’ ratings from A.M. Best. The outlook for all the ratings is stable.The rating affirmations came on the back of Prudential’s sustained solid operational performance, solid enterprise risk management, promising business profile and a sturdy balance sheet.The company has a track of delivering statutory income for the last five years, riding on its leading presence in core business lines. The company now has more than $65 billion as funded pension account value besides a strong presence in the unfunded U.K. risk transfer business market.Also, Prudential boasts a consolidated international presence, dominated by its Japan operations, constituting about two-fifths of the company’s total operating earnings. The company also enjoys a leading position in the variable annuity market, banking on its diversified product offerings.Prudential enjoys a solid balance sheet, given its access to diversified sources of liquidity and capital markets. However, an extended use of captives to finance redundant reserves for term and universal life products drags the positive. Also, a significant concentration of annuity reserves, higher than the industry average allocation to commercial mortgages, weighs on the positives.Shares of Prudential have outperformed the industry in a year. The stock has rallied 12.3%, lagging the industry’s increase of 11.4%. Prudential’s vast distribution network, penetration and control over the pension risk transfer business besides a strong international presence and a robust capital position will continue to drive the shares up. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. While rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Prudential retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked multiline insurers can also look at Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report), MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report).Loews Corporation provides commercial property and casualty insurance in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore.

2987,L,"Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has announced $1.3 billion 2018 property catastrophe reinsurance program, intended to curb its risk and financial exposure, fortifying financial capabilities. The reinsurance coverage comprises $985 million for the U.S. catastrophe loss and $315 billion for the International segment.The company announced that its reinsurance premiums are projected at $121 million. This is about $5 million lower than the reinsurance premium of $126 million registered in 2017. The reduction in premiums stemmed from the company’s lowered exposure to lender-placed insurance.Per the program, the U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage encompasses Assurant retaining $120 million coverage and the reinsuring, $985 million coverage. The multi-year reinsurance contract should cover a portion of the $985 million layer in excess of $240 million. In its Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Assurant will cover $88 million loss while reinsure 90% of $283 million loss.Per the program, International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage has increased from the previous year with expansion of Assurant’s business in the select property markets. The International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage for Latin America is $183.5 million and for Caribbean, is $162.5 million. The company will have $4.5 million coverage for loss in Latin America and $17.5 million for the Caribbean.With this new reinsurance program, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer can now better serve its 2.9 million homeowners and renters policyholders.Assurant is directing its capabilities to the targeted markets and enhancing its operating efficiency as well. The company envisions earnings growth and margin expansion at the Lifestyle segment through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies, worldwide. Thus, reinsuring its insurance coverage seems a prudent move in the present scenario. This move can possibly enhance the company’s profitability and financial flexibility.Shares of Assurant have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 3% versus the industry’s decline of 4.6%.

2988,L,"The A2 insurance financial strength (IFS) rating of the UK-based AIG Europe Limited (AIGEL), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), has been affirmed by Moody’s Investors Service, the rating arm of Moody’s Corporation.The rating agency has additionally assigned provisional IFS ratings of (P) A2 to the newly established indirect AIG subsidiaries namely, UK-based American International Group UK Limited (AIG UK) and Luxembourg-based AIG Europe S.A. (AESA). The outlook remains stable.Reasons Behind the RatingsMoody’s ratings for the P & C insurer AIGEL, reflect its strong market position in the UK commercial lines, its broad product portfolio offered in Europe, its investment strategy as well as the support provided by its affiliates. However, these positives are partially offset by the company’s weak operating results in recent years, catastrophe loss, adverse loss development reserve and its relatively high gross underwriting leverage.AIGEL is working on its operating performance by shifting resources toward more profitable segments and tightening policy limits along with reducing expenses and using more reinsurance to decrease volatility.AIGEL’s stable outlook is based on the rating agency view that the unit’s underwriting and reserve volatility will be lowered to such an extent that it will improve its combined ratio to less than 100%.AIG UK is expected to write commercial lines such as property, liability, special risks and financial lines for multinational, national and middle market clients based on AIGEL’s current operations.Meanwhile, AESA will not only have a majority of its business in commercial lines but will also write a significant proportion of consumer lines like personal accident, extended warranty and private client coverages. The rating giant expects the companies to be sold through global and regional brokers as well as via smaller agents and other such channels.Moody’s provisional ratings on AIG UK and AESA prove that the agency anticipates both the company’s arms to get explicit and implicit support from affiliates. This backing is likely to include reinsurance ceded to AIG's flagship P&C operations in the United States, AIG Property Casualty U.S., Inc. (AIG PC US, IFS rating A2 stable) and capital available from AIG parent.The agency hopes to assign definitive IFS ratings to AESA and AIG UK just when AIGEL deicides to transfer its business to the same entities, which is scheduled for Dec 1, 2018.What can Lead to Ratings Upgrade or Downgrade?The factors likely leading to a rating upgrade for AIGEL, AIG UK and AESA include increase in underwriting results and profitability, a favorable or benign development of loss reserves, gross underwriting leverage below 3.5x and an upgrade of the AIG PC US rating.And the aspects, which might cause a rating downgrade for AIGEL, AIG UK and AESA, are continuous soft underwriting results, further adverse loss development reserve and losses possibly rendering a decline in the capital by more than 10% in a year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) have lost 17.50%, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.39% in the past year. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Kemper Corporation ((KMPR  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report).Kemper is a diversified insurance holding company, providing property and casualty, and life and health insurance in the United States.

2991,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30 before the market opens. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.3%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.A consistently better performance at CNA Financial (CNA  -  Free Report), a Lowes subsidiary, is likely to have aided Loews to deliver an improved quarterly result. CNA Financial intensified its focus on core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by shedding reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance, and group health products as well as reinsuring asbestos and pollution liabilities to lower balance sheet risk.CNA Financial continues to efficiently manage its long-term care book of business through efficient product claim management, thereby mitigating risks as well as effecting rate increase.Nonetheless, an exposure to cat loss might have been a drag on CNA Financial’s underwriting profitability.Loews Hotels is likely to have continued to deliver a strong performance, banking on solid operations at its hotel properties.Boardwalk Pipeline (BWP  -  Free Report) is expected to have delivered better numbers on the strength of its growth projects.  However, lower day rate and lower rigs working are expected to have weighed on Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment. However, higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment should have limited this downside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 78 cents, down 1.3% year over year.A lower tax incidence owing to a drop in the tax rate might provide an additional boost to the bottom line. Also, continued share buybacks should have improved the bottom line.What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Loews has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Loews holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Shares have lost about 4.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout?

Earnings surged 27% year over year.The quarter witnessed a better performance by CNA Financial, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels and improved results from the parent company’s investment portfolio.

Rise in insurance premiums, contract drilling revenues and other revenues aided this improvement.Behind the HeadlinesTotal expenses declined 16.7% year over year to $3 billion, mainly due to lower contract drilling expenses and other operating costs as well as a decrease in insurance claims & policyholders' benefits.CNA Financial’s revenues increased 4.3% from the prior-year quarter to $2.4 billion. It reported net income attributable to Loews Corp. is $244 million, up 29% from the year-ago quarter. This improvement may be attributed to current accident year underwriting results from its core P&C business and higher realized investment gains. However, lower net investment income limited the upside.Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues inched up 3.2% year over year to $318 million. Net income attributable to Loews, plunged 65% year over year to $7 million, due to loss on the sale of a processing facility.Loews Hotels’ revenues declined 4.2 % year over year to $181 million.

Net income attributable to Loews was $7 million, comparing favorably with ($294 million) in the year-ago quarter. Higher fleet utilization and lower depreciation expense resulted mainly from the asset impairment charges taken in 2016.Book value as of Jun 30, 2017 was $56.01 per share, up about 2.5% from $54.62 as of Dec 31, 2016.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

2993,L,"Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 12 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2200.00%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter, Loews is likely to have experienced higher catastrophe loss in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This in turn might hurt the company’s underwriting profitability and also render volatility to its earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share, reflecting an 8.9% year-over-year decline.Moreover, increase in expenses is anticipated to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the Multi line insurer’s overall performance in turn.Nonetheless, the company has possibly displayed better-than-expected results at Loews Hotels in the soon-to-be-reported period. In fact, this particular segment has benefitted from higher equity income from Universal Orlando joint-venture properties, reflected in the segment’s improved earnings and revenues.Additionally, the company’s Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment gained from higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment. The yet-to-be reported quarter is estimated to have experienced these favorable factors leading to higher contribution from Diamond Offshore.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Loews has an Earnings ESP of -11.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Loews holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (BHF  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 12. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.27% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.71% and a Zacks Rank #3.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2995,L,"The second-quarter earnings season is well underway with 34.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the performance of 171 index members (accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 8.8% on 3.4% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.9% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.8%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. About 43.2% of the S&P 500 index members, that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.7% earnings growth on 5.2% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for the bottom line and 70.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. Few insurers are expected to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion, built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the developing economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have supported more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher to contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. This apart, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have possibly benefited the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing out pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s evaluate the performance of the following three insurers ahead of their release of quarterly numbers on Jul 31.CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) offers commercial P&C insurance products, mainly across the United States. Last quarter, CNA Financial substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.13%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP  of +4.00% make us confident of an earnings beat this time. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 78 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 for an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CNA Financial is likely to report bottom-line growth in the second quarter on the back of better performance across its Specialty, International as well as Life & Group Non-Core segments. Rising interest rate environment likely have favored higher net investment income. Disciplined approach toward the market is expected to have resulted in an improvement in new business. However, higher expenses might have hurt the company’s overall profitability.  (Read: CNA Financial Q2 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards? )With respect to the surprise trend, CNA Financial beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 12.45%.CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CNA Financial Corporation QuoteLoews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) provides commercial property and casualty insurance in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore. Last reported quarter, Loews significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 31.82%. The company with a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -5.26% make surprise prediction difficult. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 72 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 76 cents per share.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5), going into an earnings announcement.Ongoing challenging conditions in the offshore drilling market might have induced lower revenues at its Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report). Due to challenging market conditions, thereby resulting in lower rates and a decreased insured exposure likely have hurt underwriting results. Loews Corp. has likely witnessed a solid performance at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP  -  Free Report) and Loews Hotels units in the second quarter. Additionally, the company’s subsidiary, CNA Financial’s improved results have in turn likely boosted its overall second-quarter performance.   (Read: Loews Corp Q2 Earnings: Is Disappointment in Store?)With respect to the surprise trend, Loews surpassed expectations in the last four quarters.

2996,L,"An improving US economy is helping all the industries to gradually return to growth trajectory. Notable decline in unemployment, easing of the U.S. dollar, momentum in oil prices, increase in spending and an improving GDP buoy optimism among investors.Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018. GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5%, reflecting an increase from 2.1%, projected earlier. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018. Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul to tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden.Good news is that the mortgage insurance, which also was hit hard by the financial crisis in 2008 like others, is gradually getting into shape. A steady improvement in the housing market fundamentals and an improving employment scenario are poised for long-term growth.Per the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage applications inched up 0.7% in the last week of December compared with the 4.9% decline in the third week. Also, refinance improved 1.4%, though applications to purchase slipped only 0.1%.The mortgage insurers have been witnessing lower new delinquencies and declining claims payments. On the other hand, new insurance written have been increasing steadily. With strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the companies to see fewer claims than before. The mortgage insurers have also been following stringent underwriting standards to ensure profitability.However, the mortgage insurance market is highly competitive with a few players capturing a large market share. Along with private players, the company also faces stiff competition from Federal Housing Administration, which slashed its annual premium to make loans more affordable.Mortgage insurers are part of the Multiline Insurance industry, ranked at #102 (lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 265 plus industries). In fact it climbed the ladder from Rank #183 (which falls in the lower half of the Zacks Industry Rank) a week earlier.  The Multiline Insurance industry gained 8.5% in a year.Here we focus on two mortgage insurers, Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report) and MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report). Radian Group is a credit enhancement company, supporting homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services. While MGIC Investment provides primary insurance to cushion lenders against non-payment of individual loans and expands home ownership opportunities by enabling people to purchase homes with slimmer down payments. Also, Radian Group has a market capitalization of $4.5 billion while MGIC Investment has $5.3 billion of the same.It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals. Some better-ranked stocks from the industry are Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Loews Corporation(L  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks RankBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group sport a Zacks Rank #1. Thus both fare equally.Price PerformanceBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group have outperformed the industry in a year. While shares of Radian Group have rallied 14.6%, that of MGIC Investment has surged 36.3%. Here, MGIC Investment performs better than Radian Group.ValuationThe price-to-book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing mortgage insurers. Compared with the industry’s P/B ratio of 1.44, both Radian Group and MGIC Investment are overpriced. Yet with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.50, Radian Group is relatively cheaper than MGIC Investment’s trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.69. This round clearly goes to Radian Group.VGM ScoreWhile Radian Group carries a VGM Score of B, MGIC Investment has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors. This round undoubtedly goes to Radian Group again.Debt-to-EquityBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group have lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 45.9. MGIC Investment with a leverage ratio of 26.5 has an edge over Radian Group with the same of 34.4.Return-on-EquityReturn-on-equity for MGIC Investment is 16.4% and Radian Group is 13%, both outperforming the industry average of 7%. Comparatively, MGIC Investment has an edge over Radian Group here.Risk-to-Capital RatioMGIC Investment’s risk-to-capital ratio was 10.1:1 as of Sep 30, 2017 while that of Radian Group was 13.4:1. MGIC Investment wins this round hands down.Earnings Surprise HistoryPer the companies’ surprise history, MGIC Investment has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 27.11%. Whereas, Radian Group has delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average four-quarter beat of 4.52%.Hence, MGIC Investment scores over Radian Group in this context.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsMGIC Investment’s 2018 estimates have been raised 5.9% in the last 60 days.  While Radian Group stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved 5.2% north over the same time frame.For MGIC Investment, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $1.26 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 3.9%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.5%.For Radian Group, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $2.03 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15.4%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 5%.This round therefore goes to MGIC Investment right away. To ConcludeMGIC Investment holds an edge over Radian Group on the basis of rank, growth projections, surprise history, return-on-equity, risk-to-capital ratio and leverage. Considering parameters of valuation and VGM Score, Radian Group seems better-poised than MGIC Investment. However, based on our comparative analysis, MGIC Investment presently has an advantage over Radian Group.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

With capital at its disposal to acquire and develop properties, the company is seeking opportunities in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, Dallas, Toronto and Seattle.

The company has been investing in information technology to boost underwriting capabilities. Although this will put pressure on the company’s margin in near term, the company seems to benefit over the long term.

The packaging industry offers scope for solid cash flow generation.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 31.82%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterLoews Corp. is likely to report lower revenues at its Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, due to ongoing challenging conditions in the offshore drilling market. Such a weak segmental performance might have impacted the company’s overall second-quarter results.In addition, the Diamond Offshore unit has likely experienced a decline in net income, attributable to Loews Corp. in the second quarter due to a tough operating environment.Further, the company is likely to display weak underwriting results in the second quarter due to challenging market conditions, thereby resulting in lower rates and a decreased insured exposure.Also, the company has likely experienced a rise in total expenses this soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Loews Corp. has likely witnessed a solid performance at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP  -  Free Report) and Loews Hotels units in the second quarter. Additionally, the company’s subsidiary, CNA Financial’s (CNA  -  Free Report), improved results have in turn likely boosted its overall second-quarter performance.With respect to the surprise trend, the company delivered positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 25.77%.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
